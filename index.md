Your one-stop-shop for fully searchable versions of the court transcripts for the People v Donald J. Trump Criminal case (indictment # 71543-2023).

It appears that the transcripts are getting published on to the [New York State Unified Court System](https://ww2.nycourts.gov/press/index.shtml) on the next business day somewhere between 20:00-22:30 UTC time.  We will endeavour to publish them here as soon as possible (usually within a few hours).

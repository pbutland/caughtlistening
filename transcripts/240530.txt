SERGEANT: All rise. Part 59 is now in session. The Honorable Juan Merchan is presiding.

THE COURT: You may be seated.

THE CLERK: This is The People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump. Indictment 71543 of '23. Appearances, starting with the People.

MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua Steinglass, Matthew Colangelo, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Christopher Conroy, Katherine Ellis. Good morning, everyone.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. BLANCHE: Good morning, Your Honor. Todd Blanche, and I am joined by Emil Bove, Susan Necheles, and Kendra Wharton, and President Trump to my left. Good morning.

THE COURT: Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Trump. So, as promised, I did review the disputed sections of read-back, and I sent you an email this morning telling you what I had decided. In substance, I determined that all of the areas that were in dispute, which at this point weren't really very many, they should all come in. Subsequent to that, I received another email suggesting that if I was going to include one section, that I should include another; and my position is that you should as well. Anything that either one of you would like to put on the record regarding that?

MR. STEINGLASS: No thank you, Judge.

MR. BLANCHE: No, your Honor.

THE COURT: So, I think we are ready for the read back. We did receive another note that I would like to put on the record. It's marked as Court Exhibit Number 6, signed by the Jury Foreperson at 9:32 this morning, and it says: We, the jury, request: First, that the read-back of the instructions begin with the description of how the jury considers the evidence and what inferences can be drawn from the facts, example, rain metaphor, through the description of the law with respect to Count 1. As I see it, what they are asking then is for me to begin on Page 7 and continue to Page 35.

MR. BLANCHE: We agree.

THE COURT: You agree?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: Do you want to start on Page 6?

MR. BLANCHE: I guess the only question is whether to start on Page 6, instead of 7, where the charge starts, Evidence. They certainly pointed to Page 7, which is the window, rain example, but they don't have a hard copy of the --

THE COURT: We can start on Page 6, that's fine. And then there was a second request: Whether or not we can be provided with headphones with a 3.5 MM input jack for use with the evidence laptop. I confirmed that we can provide them with such headphones, and I am also told that we can provide them with speakers that they can connect to the computer. This way they can all listen to it at the same time, which they can not do if they have headphones.

MR. STEINGLASS: We would just suggest both.

MR. BLANCHE: Agreed.

THE COURT: All right. Okay. If there is nothing else to clarify, let's bring in the jury.

MR. STEINGLASS: I don't think the Court Reporters have the last thing added this morning. I just want to put that on the record, if you give me one minute, please. So, we are adding Page 1481, Line 4 through Page 1482, Line 25. There was a piece of that that was already there, but it's now a more fulsome section. Okay.

MR. BLANCHE: And we agree with that.

MR. STEINGLASS: May I, for the record, both parties were given a copy of Court Exhibit 6, which is a note from this morning and signed at 9:32 am. It is the one that your Honor just read into the record.

THE COURT: Yes. Thank you for you acknowledging receipt. And I read it correctly?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: Yesterday, at the end of the day I mentioned that the laptop did not have Wi-Fi capability. I wasn't sure that was put on the record. You both acknowledge that you heard that?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

MS. HOFFINGER: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

THE COURT: Okay. You can bring in the jury now.

SERGEANT: All rise. Jury entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom and were properly seated.

THE COURT: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: Do all parties stipulate that all jurors are present and properly seated?

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

THE COURT: Good morning, Jurors. Welcome back. Jurors, it has been a little bit since I last read your two notes from yesterday, so I am going to re-read them now. First note was signed by the Jury Foreperson at 2:56. It was marked as Court Exhibit Number 4, and it says:  We, the Jury, request: First, David Pecker's testimony regarding the phone conversation to Donald Trump while David Pecker was in the investor meeting. Two, David Pecker's testimony regarding the decision not to finalize and fund the assignment of McDougal's life rights. Three, David Pecker's testimony regarding the Trump Tower meeting. And four, Michael Cohen's testimony regarding Trump Tower meeting. Okay. We have located that testimony, and we are ready to read it back to you in just one moment. You also sent us another note which was signed by the Jury Foreperson at 3:51. It was marked as Court Exhibit 5. It says: We, the jury, request to re-hear Judge's instructions. I then asked if you wanted to hear the entire set of instruction or just a portion of it. And this morning you gave us another note. That note has been marked as Court Exhibit Number 6, and it is signed by the Jury Foreperson at 9:32. And it says: We, the jury, request that the read back of the instructions begin with the description of how the jury considers the evidence and what inferences can be drawn from the facts, for example, the rain metaphor, through the description of the law with respect to Count 1. Did I read that correctly, Mr. Foreperson?

JURY FOREPERSON: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Foreperson, should I assume that you no longer need to deal with Court Exhibit Number 5, that this replaces Court Exhibit Number 5?

JURY FOREPERSON: Yes.

THE COURT: There was a second request on this note, and that is: Whether or not we can be provided with headphones with a 3.5 MM input jack for use of the evidence laptop. Did I read that correctly, Mr. Foreperson?

JURY FOREPERSON: Yes.

THE COURT: I am told that, yes, you can be provided with such a headphone, but I am also told that you can be provided with speakers that can be connected to the laptop so that more than one person can listen to it at a time. The choice is yours. I am letting you know you have the choice to make. And just let me know later, send me another note, you don't have to come back out, let me know if you want the headphones or the speakers. Ordinarily, I read the notes in the order in which they come out. But I wanted to ask whether you wanted the instructions read back first or you wanted the read-back first?

JURY FOREPERSON: The instructions first, please, your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. So, the instructions will be Pages 6 through 35. When you judge the facts, you are to consider only the evidence. The evidence in this case includes: The testimony of the witnesses, the exhibits that were received in evidence, and the stipulations agreed to by the parties. Remember, a stipulation is information the parties have agreed to present to the jury as evidence, without calling a witness to testify. Testimony which was stricken from the record or to which an objection was sustained must be disregarded by you. Exhibits that were received in evidence are available, upon your request, for your inspection and consideration. Exhibits that were just seen during the trial, or marked for identification but not received in evidence, are not evidence, and are thus not available for your inspection and consideration. Testimony based upon those exhibits that were not received in evidence may be considered by you. In evaluating the evidence, you may consider any fact that is proven and any inference which may be drawn from such fact. To draw an inference means to infer, find, conclude that a fact exists or does not exist based upon proof of some other fact or facts. For example, suppose you go to bed one night and it is not raining, and when you wake up in the morning, you look out your window. You do not see rain, but you see that the street and sidewalk are wet, and that people are wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. Under those circumstances, it may be reasonable to infer, that is conclude, that it rained during the night. In other words, the fact of it having rained while you were asleep is an inference that might be drawn from the proven facts of the presence of the water on the street and sidewalk, and people in raincoats and carrying umbrellas. An inference must only by drawn from a proven fact or facts, and then, only if the inference flows naturally, reasonably and logically from the proven fact or facts, not if it is speculative. Therefore, in deciding whether to draw an inference, you must look at and consider all the facts in light of reason, common sense and experience. As you know, certain exhibits were admitted into evidence with some portions blacked out or redacted. Those redactions were made to remove personal identifying information and to ensure that only relevant admissible evidence was put before you. You may not speculate as to what material was redacted or why, and you may not draw any inference, favorable or unfavorable against either party, from the fact that certain material has been redacted. You may recall that I instructed you several times during the trial that certain exhibits were being accepted into evidence for a limited purpose only, and that you were not to consider that evidence for any other purpose. Under the law we refer to that as a limiting instruction. I will now remind you of some of the limiting instructions that you were given during the course of the trial. You will recall that you heard testimony that while David Pecker was an executive at AMI, AMI entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Federal prosecutors, as well as the Conciliation Agreement with the Federal Election Commission, the FEC. I remind you that evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David Pecker's credibility and to help provide context for some of the surrounding events. You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Neither the Non-Prosecution Agreement, nor the Conciliation Agreement is evidence of the Defendant's guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes. You also heard testimony that the Federal Election Commission conducted an investigation into the payment to Stormy Daniels and of responses submitted by Michael Cohen and his attorneys to the investigation. That evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Michael Cohen's credibility and to help provide context for some of the surrounding events. You may consider that evidence for those purposes only. Likewise, you will recall that you heard testimony that Michael Cohen pled guilty to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, otherwise known a FECA. I remind you that evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Mr. Cohen's credibility as a witness and to help provide context for some of the events that followed. You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Neither the fact of the FEC investigation, Mr. Cohen and his attorney's responses, or the fact that Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty constitutes evidence of the Defendant's guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes. You will recall that certain Wall Street Journal news articles were accepted into evidence during the trial. I remind you now that the articles were accepted and may be that the articles were published on or about a certain date and to provide context for the other evidence. The exhibits may not be considered by you as evidence that any of the assertions in the articles are actually true. There were other exhibits which contained hearsay and were not accepted for the truth of the matter asserted but for another purpose. For example, there were several National Enquirer headlines and an invoice from Investor Advisory Services which is People's 161 in evidence. Those were accepted for the limited purpose of demonstrating that the articles were published and the document created. There were also some text messages that were accepted with a similar limitation. For example, People's Exhibit 171-A with respect to Gina Rodriguez's texts and 257 with respect to Chris Cuomo's texts, those text messages were accepted for the limited purpose of providing context for the responses by Dylan Howard and Michael Cohen. The exhibits which were accepted into evidence with a limiting instruction are 152, 153-A, 153-B, 153-C, 161, 171-A, 180, 181 and 257. If you have any additional questions or need

JURY FOREPERSON: Yes.

THE COURT: We will get the read-back, now.

THE COURT REPORTER: I will read the questions as if I am the lawyer and my colleague will read the answers as if she was the witness.

THE CLERK: Your Honor, the jury has been polled.

THE COURT: Thank you. Jurors, I want to thank you very much for your service in this case. We started picking a jury here on April 15th. We had opening statements on April 22nd. And we didn't have summations until May 21st. That's a long time. That's a long time you were away from your jobs, your families, your other responsibilities. But, not only that, you were engaged in a very stressful and difficult task. I want you to know that I really admire your dedication and your hard work. I observed you. As I said before, I observed you during the course of the trial, and I could see how involved you were, how engaged you were, how invested you were in this process. And you gave this matter the attention it deserved. I want to thank you for that. I want to thank the alternate jurors, as well. We couldn't do this without you. I've had plenty of trials where I've had to use one or all of my alternate jurors. Without service of the alternate jurors, I would not have completed those trials. Thank you very much. Jurors, you'll remember, during the course of the trial I gave you certain admonitions many, many times. I want you to know that those admonitions no longer apply. You are free to discuss the case with anyone you would like to discuss it with, but you're also free not to. No one can make you do anything that you don't want to do. The choice is yours. In a few minutes, if it's okay with you, I would like to meet with you in the jury room, just to thank you personally for your work. Bear in mind, I'm not allowed to discuss the facts of the case. I'm also not permitted to discuss your deliberations. But, I do want to personally thank you for your service, and I'd also like to get your feedback, get a sense of what we did right, what we did wrong. There are a couple of matters I need to take care of here. I'll do that quickly so I can join you in the back. At this time, I thank you very much. You're excused with the gratitude of the Court.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jurors are excused and discharged at 5:11 PM and exit the courtroom, and the alternate jurors are excused and discharged and exit the courtroom.

THE COURT: You may be seated. Any motions, applications, anything to go over at this time?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes. We move for a Judgment of Acquittal and to set aside the verdict for the reasons we previously stated. Just to emphasize a few significant reasons that came out since we made it:  There's no basis and there's no way this jury could have reached a verdict without accepting the testimony of Mr. Cohen; and we believe unequivocally that that testimony, even though it would stand in this courtroom, that he lied, there was perjury committed. And there is no reason that the Court should allow a verdict, knowing that one of the witnesses that, necessarily, had to be part of the crime that was committed and the offense should be used to convict President Trump. And so, for that reason, combined with the fact that there was no evidence, certainly limited evidence that had any -- any connection between the charged conduct and President Trump, and the limited connection was Michael Cohen, we believe in light of that fact, which I don't think is in dispute, the Court should enter a Judgment of Acquittal, notwithstanding the verdict.

THE COURT: I'm sure you misspoke when you said "knowing". You're not suggesting that I "know" anybody committed perjury; right?

MR. BLANCHE: Correct.

THE COURT: People?

MR. STEINGLASS: Very briefly, we, of course, disagree with Mr. Blanche's characterization of Michael Cohen's testimony. For all the reasons set forth in the summation and the entire trial record, there's more than enough evidence in this case for a reasonable jury to have reached the verdict that it did. So, we urge your Honor to reject the Defense motion.

THE COURT: Your motion is denied. Any other motions or applications before we adjourn the matter?

MR. BLANCHE: May we approach, briefly, your Honor?

THE COURT: On the record.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebar:

MR. BLANCHE: I just wanted to ask about the sentencing date and be heard on the date. I didn't know what the Court's practice was.

THE COURT: Sure. We can do that in open court.

MR. BLANCHE: I didn't know the process.

THE COURT: We can do that in open court.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Blanche?

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we would ask for a date for sentencing on some date in mid to late July. The reason for that is, as the Court is aware, President Trump faces other charges in other jurisdictions. In the case in Florida, there is a three-day hearing scheduled for late June; and the work ahead of that hearing requires Counsel to be in Florida, inside a SCIF, for much of the time between now and the date of hearing and, also, the date of the hearing itself, which will require us to just not be able to focus on this matter. So, we, respectfully, request a date at some point in mid to late July for sentence.

MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, the standard adjournment for an out I and S is six weeks. So, we don't oppose a date in mid-July.

THE COURT: We will adjourn this matter for sentence to July 11th. We will order a Probation Report. Mr. Blanche, the clerk of the court will give you instructions on how to go about scheduling that Probation interview and getting that Probation Report. This will be July 11th, at 10:00 AM. If there are going to be any motions filed, I direct the Defense to file their motions no later than June 13th. That would be two weeks from today. If any motions are filed by that date, the People are directed to respond by June 27th. And that's the parameter of time that the Court would have to decide any motions. If there's nothing else, you're excused. Thank you very much.

MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

THE COURT: What is the current bail status?

MR. STEINGLASS: There is no bail.

THE COURT: Mr. Trump remains ROR'd.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the case is adjourned for sentence to July 11th, 2024 at 10:00 A.M.

First of all, we had indicated that, potentially, that we would call another witness, that was going to be another book publisher, but we've decided that we really don't need to do that. So, Mr. Cohen will be the last witness. Related to that, I don't know how long Mr. Blanche's cross-examination will be, but I think that it's highly likely that we will get to the defense case, such as it is, on Thursday. And we don't know who the defense witnesses are, except for an expert witness and potentially Mr. Trump. They've indicated that the only other witnesses that they intend to call are impeachment witnesses. Under 245.20 (4)(b), we are entitled to know that at the end of whatever witness' testimony they are seeking to impeach. So I understand that we haven't gotten there yet with Michael Cohen, but if there are any other impeachment witnesses that they intend to call to impeach one or other of our witnesses, we would like to know who those witnesses are. I think we're entitled to know who they are. Also, for planning purposes, we are entitled to have our potential rebuttal expert present for any expert testimony that they may proffer on their case. And so, we would like to know when the expert will testify so that we can make -- our expert is not local, so we can make travel arrangements, so that we don't have to have an unnecessary delay."

But whether we call him depends, in part, on the charge -- we submitted the charge, just this morning, so I know you haven't read it yet.

And they've asked for a limiting instruction, I guess, along the lines of the prior instruction that your Honor gave. We do have a draft of that instruction.

They do the monitoring under what's called the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement. It's an ankle bracelet. And I was finally given a date and was supposed to, the following day, head up to the Bronx to sign the paperwork and to do, um, the installation of the ankle bracelet. Instead, I received a phone call from an individual by the name of Adam Pakula over at 500 Pearl Street, which is the area of the Southern District of New York. They have their Bureau of Prisons, as well, Department of Correction. And I'm told that I need to go there instead of up to the Bronx. And it just didn't make any sense. So I asked a friend of mine who happens to be a lawyer, Jeffrey K. Levine, to come with me because something just seems wrong. We get there, and we're brought into an office with Adam Pakula, with his supervisor Ms. Enid Febus, and they give us a two-page document that's supposed to represent the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement. It doesn't look like a Federal document to me or to my friend, Jeff. There's no identifiable numbers on it, some typos and spelling mistakes. And we're reading the first paragraph, and the first paragraph is a very broad paragraph of First Amendment violations: I'm not allowed to speak to the press --"

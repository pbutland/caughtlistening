1 for everyone.
2 Howard is texting Davidson and relayed the
3 message he just sent to Cohen, and he is clearly trying to
4 get both sides back to the table.
5 And you have another ensuing flurry of calls,
6 some of them on encrypted apps, all in the next half hour.
7 Cohen to Davidson. You don't have to remember
8 all of these. The point is that there is a flurry of phone
9 activity among the co—conspirators here.
10 Pecker calls Cohen on the encrypted app.
11 Cohen calls Pecker also on Signal.
12 Davidson to Cohen. Pecker to Cohen. Cohen to
13 Pecker. Pecker to Cohen. Davidson to Cohen. Pecker to
14 Cohen.
15 This is all in a half hour.
16 Cohen to Pecker. A long call from Cohen to
17 Davidson. And Howard gets back to Davidson after the
18 three—way call with Cohen and Pecker and tells Davidson,
19 push for the cash.
20 He specifically tells Davidson that he and Pecker
21 just wrote Cohen he has to pay the 150,000.
22 And during the same time, while Cohen and Pecker
23 are calling each other repeatedly on Signal —— like I said,
24 I am not going to bore you with every Signal record here ——
25 there is another call between Howard and Davidson.

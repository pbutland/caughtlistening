1            Her story would have, as we said earlier,
2   undermined the strategy completely of playing off this tape
3   as only words.
4            Remember, Daniels had been out there for a decade,
5   and nobody once thought it was important to buy her life
6   rights to keep her from talking -- to protect the
7   Defendant's family.  That didn't happen until two weeks
8   before the election.
9            And when the story finally broke, in 2018, the
10   Defendant explicitly told Ms. Hicks that it's better that
11   the story came out now than before the election.
12            There is just no rational argument that Cohen's
13   payment to Daniels was made if not for the election, would
14   have been made if not for the election.
15            Other options you can consider as unlawful means
16   include any other one of the unlawful business records that
17   contribute to the effort to promote or prevent the
18   Defendant's election.
19            They include Cohen's bank opening records at First
20   Republic Bank for both Resolution Consultants and Essential
21   Consultants; the bank paperwork for the wire transfer to
22   Keith Davidson; the phony invoice from Daniel Rotstein at
23   IAS to Essential Consultants, billing $125,000 as a flat fee
24   for services rendered, and it was really for McDougal's life
25   rights; and the 1099s issued to Cohen by both the DJT entity

1 that?
2 On redirect, they showed you a picture with the
3 unremarkable fact that everybody already knew that
4 President Trump's bodyguard was with him on October 24th.
5 No kidding. Thanks.
6 They are perfectly happy to have a witness come
7 in here and commit perjury, to lie to you.
8 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
9 THE COURT: Sustained.
10 MR. BLANCHE: They have a witness who told you
11 that they had a key conversation with President Trump on
12 October 24th at eight o'clock at night and it was not true.
13 Now, we happened to catch him in a lie. The
14 People showed Mr. Cohen a series of text messages with Mr.
15 Schiller. You saw that. It's in evidence.
16 Consequently, it does not include the text
17 messages with Mr. Schiller and Mr. Cohen involving the
18 14—year—old. They didn't show you that.
19 We put that into evidence, and now you know what
20 happened.
21 Is there the same absolute proof of lies for
22 every single thing that man told you?
23 No. He knows there is not.
24 For that, we have what's called an oath. We have
25 an oath that every witness takes when they testify in front

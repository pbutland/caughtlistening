Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4809
1            The Defendant used his own business records as the
2   vehicle to disguise the reimbursement because he didn't want
3   anyone finding out about the conspiracy to corrupt the
4   election.
5            Everything Mr. Trump and his cohorts did in this
6   case was cloaked in lies.  Lies in the DJT and Trust
7   business records themselves. Lies in the phony invoice from
8   IAS about a flat fee. Lies in the bank account opening
9   documents about the true nature of those accounts. Lies in
10   the bank paperwork for the wire transfer.  Lies in the
11   1099s.  Pseudonyms, shell companies, encrypted apps, a paper
12   lease HELOC to fund the deal.
13            The Defendant refused to use email to avoid leaving
14   a paper trail; misleading and an outright false denial about
15   Pecker, Davidson, Daniels, Cohen and his lawyer, all in a
16   last ditch effort to prevent the truth from coming out.
17            The name of the game was concealment, and all roads
18   lead inescapably to the man who benefitted most, the
19   Defendant, former-President Donald Trump.
20            And I, too, want to take a moment to thank you.
21            And I realize that this could be a frustrating
22   case.  It has gone on a while.
23            And you have really been a remarkable group in
24   terms of, I have never seen a jury here exactly on time
25   every day.

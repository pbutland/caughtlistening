Summation/Mr. Blanche
4535
1   that there were a group of people that wanted to take
2   advantage of a situation and, ultimately, extort money from
3   President Trump.  That's what happened.  People like
4   Ms. Daniels, Ms. Rodriguez, her agents, Mr. Davidson.
5            Remember when we asked Mr. Cohen if he actually
6   believed it was an extortion attempt, he said yes, he did
7   believe it was an extortion attempt.
8            By the way, it was another opportunity for Mr.
9   Cohen to actually take advantage.  He made a decision to
10   pay that $130,000 to Ms. Daniels.  He didn't tell President
11   Trump about it.  He wanted to do it because he knew that he
12   could get credit for doing something to supposedly help
13   President Trump at some later time.  Whether they won the
14   election or lost the election, he would be able to get that
15   credit.
16            So, remember what is happening with him at the
17   time.  He was very worried about his future.  You saw and
18   heard multiple, multiple examples of that.  He was worried
19   about what would happen if President Trump won, he was
20   worried about what would happen if President Trump lost,
21   what he would be doing.
22            People were not happy with him on the campaign.
23   And so, he made this decision.
24            The only person that suggests otherwise, the only
25   person that comes in and tells you, oh, no, President Trump

2             THE COURT:  People, depending on what time Mr.
3   Blanche ends, we may take the lunch recess, not start for a
4   half hour and then interrupt you.
5             MR. STEINGLASS:  That will work.
6             SERGEANT:  All rise, jury entering.
7                  (Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom
8             and were properly seated.)
9             THE COURT:  Thank you.
10             Please be seated.
11             THE CLERK:  Case on trial continued.
12             All jurors are present and properly seated.
13             THE COURT:  Mr. Blanche.
14             MR. BLANCHE:  All right.
15             So, continuing with Ms. Daniels' situation in
16   2016.
17             So, the question for you is:  Was what happened
18   with Ms. Daniels in 2016 consistent with the conspiracy,
19   the conspiracy that the People tell you Mr. Cohen,
20   President Trump and David Pecker entered into in 2015?
21             And the reason why we are going through the
22   details, the reasons we are going through the recordings
23   and what was said and not said is because that is what
24   matters, is whether the conduct and what you heard about
25   Ms. Daniels and what led to the NDA by Mr. Cohen in October

Summation/Blanche
4499
1 Personal Attorney?
2 Now, Mr. McConney is the only witness who
3 testified about the 1099s at this trial, and he told you
4 that there is no way on the 1099 Form, as you can see
5 there, to differentiate between whether it's a legal
6 service or a various expense. You just mark it, and you
7 send it to the person who works for you —— in this case,
8 Michael Cohen —— and it's his responsibility to deal with
9 it with the IRS.
10 There's nothing criminal about that at all. It's
11 the way it's supposed to be done.
12 So, that's one reason why there's no intent to
13 defraud.
14 But, also, you can look —— by the way, these
15 Forms are in evidence, so you don't have to take my word
16 for it.
17 But, they're exactly accurate.
18 Mr. Cohen, at the time, was a non—employee at The
19 Trump Organization. He was a Personal Attorney to
20 President Trump, an outside attorney. And the payments
21 were compensation to him. Period.
22 Nothing false.
23 Now, we offered these documents through
24 Mr. McConney. Not the Government.
25 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.

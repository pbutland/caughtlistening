Summation/Steinglass
4763
1 MR. STEINGLASS: First of all, this is not his
2 allocution. It‘s his testimony. I am reading from his
3 testimony, which is in evidence.
4 Number two, the whole point I'm trying to make ——
5 and we'll get to after I finish reading these quotes —— is
6 that this is when he pled guilty; and the next day, the
7 Defendant started changing his tune, the way he was
8 tweeting.
9 That's why it was admitted, to put it in context.
10 THE COURT: Okay.
11 I appreciate it's his testimony. That's fair.
12 You've commented on it. That's fair.
13 I think that's enough.
14 You can make your point without having to repeat
15 it.
16 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay.
17 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
18 in open court:)
19 MR. STEINGLASS: We'll go to the page on the
20 right.
21 "Question: Why, in fact, did you pay that money
22 to Stormy Daniels?"
23 "Answer: To ensure that the story would not come
24 out, would not effect Mr. Trump's chances of becoming
25 President of the United States."

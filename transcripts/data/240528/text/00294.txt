1   came out, Pecker and Cohen received letters from the
2   Federal Election Commission, the FEC, informing them an
3   investigation had been opened into the McDougal and
4   Daniels payoffs.
5            Pecker said Cohen was cool as a cucumber.  He
6   told Pecker he had nothing to worry about, that President
7   Trump had Attorney General Jeff Sessions in his pocket.
8            Nevertheless, Cohen was in damage control.
9            On February 6th, he sent the following to Maggie
10   Haberman of The New York Times: "Big boss just approved me
11   responding to complaint and statement. Please start
12   writing and I will call you soon."
13            Trump had authorized Cohen to disseminate a
14   highly misleading, if not flatly false, statement.
15            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
16            THE COURT:  Overruled.
17            It's argument.
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  Just like Cohen pushed Davidson
19   to have Daniels sign.
20            So, here's the denial. It's beyond misleading.
21            It says Cohen used his own personal funds, which
22   is technically true, I guess, because the money came from
23   his HELOC.
24            It says neither the TO or Trump campaign
25   reimbursed him.

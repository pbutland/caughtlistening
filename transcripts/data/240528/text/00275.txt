Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4730
1   instead getting paid pursuant to a Retainer Agreement that
2   does not exist and that the amount he was paid just happens
3   to magically match down to the penny the reimbursement
4   amount that was shown in the evidence.
5            Does anyone believe that?
6            And because the defendant repeatedly admitted that
7   he knew that the payments were a reimbursement, that means
8   by definition he knew that the payment records which
9   disguised the reimbursement as income were false.
10            So, the Defense has tried to advance this claim
11   that the defendant only discovered later -- and Mr. Blanche
12   said something like that in his summation -- the payments
13   were actually reimbursement.  That's not what the evidence
14   shows.
15            These are his books.
16            And the uncontested testimony is that Mr. Trump
17   helped work out the repayment details before the first check
18   was ever cut.
19            Six days after the White House meeting, McConney
20   asks Weisselberg to approve Cohen's invoice.
21            Weisselberg says, "Okay to pay.  Per Agreement with
22   Don and Eric."
23            And you remember, it was not Don and Eric's deal.
24   It wasn't their agreement.
25            Don and Eric were the Trustees of The Trust.

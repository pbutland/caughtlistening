1 Less than an hour later, another Tweet that's
2 favorable about Paul Manafort.
3 "Unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break, make
4 up stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a
5 brave man."
6 These tweets were not only designed to punish
7 Cohen. They were designed to send a clear message to other
8 potential witnesses: Cooperate, and you will face the
9 wrath of Donald Trump.
10 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.
11 THE COURT: Overruled.
12 MR. STEINGLASS: That's another part of the
13 Defendant's philosophy that he describes in his thoughts.
14 These excerpts are from Trump: How to Get Rich.
15 The chapter title is Sometimes You Still Have to Screw
16 Them. "One. For many years I've said that if someone
17 screws you, screw them back. Two. When somebody hurts you,
18 just go after them as viciously and as violently as you
19 can. Like it says in the bible, an eye for an eye."
20 These next few excerpts are from Think Big: Make
21 It Happen in Life:
22 "My motto is: Always get even. When somebody
23 screws you, screw them back in spades. When you are
24 wronged, go after those people because it is a good
25 feeling and because other people will see you doing it.

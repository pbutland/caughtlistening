Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 These are the charges that you ultimately have to
2 find.
3 And as Judge Merchan just told you, I'm not going
4 to talk about the law, that's the Judge's job.
5 But if I do say anything about the law, if Judge
6 Merchan says something different, his word controls, of
7 course.
8 The bottom line is, the charges in this case have
9 to do with invoices, vouchers, and checks.
10 The invoices were all submitted by Michael Cohen.
11 And I'm going to stop —— you are going to hear me talk a
12 lot about Michael Cohen today; that should not surprise
13 you.
14 You cannot convict President Trump —— you cannot
15 convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable
16 doubt on the words of Michael Cohen.
17 There were key conversations, key interactions that
18 he claimed that he had with Dylan Howard, with Keith
19 Schiller, Allen Weisselberg; those are important.
20 But Keith Schiller, Dylan Howard, and Allen
21 Weisselberg were not witnesses in this trial. Michael Cohen
22 is the witness that they called.
23 And the words that Michael Cohen said to you on
24 that stand, they matter. They matter.
25 He took an oath. He swore to tell the truth. And

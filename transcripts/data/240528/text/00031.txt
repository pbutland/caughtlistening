Summation/Mr. Blanche
4486
1                Now, as you heard, from two witnesses, President
2       Trump was very busy.
3                He was running the country.  It shouldn't be a
4       surprise about that.
5                And, one of the witnesses, Ms. Westerhout,
6       told you that what she remembers is that sometimes President
7       Trump would look at the checks and the invoices; sometimes
8       he would not.
9                And, again, that isn't surprising.
10                She testified that sometimes there were a lot of
11       checks, a half inch of personal checks because, remember,
12       nobody had the signatory authority on President Trump's
13       personal account except for President Trump.
14                So, when there were checks that had to be signed,
15       only he could do it.
16                So you can't -- you can't convict President Trump
17       because sometimes, without any -- without anything specific
18       at all to a particular charge in this case, President Trump
19       looked at invoices, that somehow he had full knowledge of
20       what was happening.
21                There is -- there is no -- that is a stretch.  That
22       is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and
23       gentlemen.
24                Same thing with respect to the Federal Express --
25       you heard about this Federal Express process that was used.

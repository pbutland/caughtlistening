Proceedings
4587
1 the People's motion in limine. That's your decision on
2 March 18th of 2024.
3 So, Mr. Blanche was certainly on notice that this
4 was an improper argument.
5 And your Honor specifically precluded it.
6 We would also ask that you give a curative
7 instruction on Retainer Agreements again, your Honor.
8 I know that we previously handed this up. We have
9 a copy that we gave to the Court previously.
10 Again, Mr. Blanche misstated the law in New York
11 to the jury. He left a false impression.
12 He relied on, in part, Mr. Davidson's testimony,
13 which, at best, relates to California law, not to New York
14 law, and I'm not even certain that it does.
15 But, we would request that curative instruction
16 again.
17 Mr. Blanche doubled down and was misrepresenting
18 the law, the ethical laws in New York.
19 THE COURT: Thank you.
20 Did you give a copy of the proposed instructions to
21 the Defense?
22 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, I did.
23 THE COURT: Both instructions?
24 MS. HOFFINGER: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Would you like to be heard?

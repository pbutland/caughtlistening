1   complain about not getting a job in the administration.
2             Now, he told you that he didn't want a job in the
3   administration, but that was a lie, another lie.
4             He claimed that he didn't remember this call that
5   Mr. Davidson told you about.
6             But Mr. Davidson was clear about his memory of
7   this call.  Mr. Cohen -- he said that Mr. Cohen told him
8   that he was in consideration to be the Attorney General of
9   the United States or possibly the Chief of Staff, and that
10   he was very upset that it didn't happen.
11             So, this -- let's go back to that.  Think about
12   what happened in October of 2017 when Mr. Cohen said on
13   that recording what you heard a minute ago, what about me?
14             Mr. Cohen had an axe to grind because he didn't
15   appreciate what President Trump did and did not do for him
16   after President Trump became President of the United
17   States.
18             Let's listen to just a little bit more of that
19   recording if we can.
20                  (Whereupon, an audio recording is played in
21             court.)
22             MR. BLANCHE:  So, what's going on here?
23             This is October 2017.  By this time, there is no
24   doubt, there is no doubt that President Trump knew that
25   Michael Cohen had made this payment.

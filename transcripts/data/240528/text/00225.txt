7   receiving the wiring instructions, et cetera, et cetera.
8            Meanwhile, Pecker continues to speak to both Hicks
9   and Trump, and Pecker and Cohen are also in communication
10   with each other via the Signal app, which shows that -- if
11   you take a screen shot, we only have a few screen shots
12   from Cohen's phone.  The screen shots don't show the
13   duration of the particular call.  They just show that a
14   call happened.
15            So, Pecker and Cohen are in communication on the
16   Signal app.  You see several on October 13th, including the

19   never funds the bank account for Resolution Consultants at

25   paperwork to fill out.  You probably remember that.  Maybe

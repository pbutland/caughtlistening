1 Mr. McConney, where he also took notes from a separate
2 meeting that he had with Mr. Weisselberg.
3 Now, here‘s something else that's very important
4 about these notes.
5 Remember when Mr. Cohen told you that he visited
6 the White House in February; remember that?
7 We put a photo up of him.
8 And we saw his calendar entry that he was going
9 to the White House.
10 So, this meeting was early February; okay.
11 He talked about it. It was a big day.
12 Now, what did he tell you about that? He told you
13 that he's going to the Oval Office for the first time in
14 his life, meeting his boss, the man he's worked for for
15 nine—and—a—half years, achieved this amazing thing of
16 becoming President of the United States, but they had a
17 conversation about the checks, about the money. That's
18 what he wants you to believe.
19 Oh, yes, we confirmed it.
20 President Trump said, "Do you need money? Do you
21 want me to write you a check?"
22 And I said, "No."
23 That's what he wants you to believe.
24 But, hold on a second.

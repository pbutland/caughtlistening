Summation/Steinglass

1   campaign, that's Election Law -- that's Federal Election
2   Campaign Finance violations.
3            We'll get back to that.
4            Now, Mr. Blanche said in his summation that they
5   didn't discuss catch and kill.
6            Now, that's not true.
7            They discussed catch and contain. They didn't use
8   the term "catch and kill", but that's exactly what it was.
9            Pecker explained he would be the eyes and ears of
10   the campaign.
11            AMI was a publishing powerhouse with dozens of
12   publications and a vast network of sources.
13            All three men knew and explicitly discussed the
14   fact that women would be coming forward with accounts of
15   sexual liaisons they had with Mr. Trump.
16            Trump, himself, told Pecker and Cohen to work
17   together: If something comes up, Pecker, you call Cohen.
18   Cohen, you take care of it. I want this to be handled.
19            So, as Mr. Pecker testified, Pecker would notify
20   Cohen, the Defendant's fixer, whenever AMI learned of such
21   a story, so that the story could be purchased and
22   suppressed. That is the definition of "catch and kill",
23   whether you use the phrase or not.
24            This is not, as Mr. Blanche suggested, like
25   buying a story that you may or may not decide to print as

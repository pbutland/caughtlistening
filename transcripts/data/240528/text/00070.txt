Summation/Mr. Blanche
4525
1   Again, he expressed his anger, "I got to get this money
2   back."
3            Ladies and gentlemen, that lunch did not happen.
4   Mr. Cohen made it up.
5            Now, even if you want to credit the idea that
6   Mr. Pecker just forgot about the lunch, he didn't testify
7   about it at all, even if you want credit that, there would
8   be other proof that the lunch happened, a credit card
9   receipt, something besides Mr. Cohen's own words, but you
10   saw none of that.
11            I am going to tell you why that matters.  When
12   key meetings and key conversations are remembered with
13   clarity from 2016 by Mr. Cohen -- think about that -- 2016,
14   you heard testimony about a clear memory of conversations.
15   You've got to check that.  Is there something about those
16   conversations that rings true?  Is there something beyond
17   the words of Michael Cohen that suggests to you that those
18   conversations, that those meetings, that those lunches
19   actually happened.
20            Now, we'll come back to the lunch in a moment, but
21   there is something else to talk about now, which is, the
22   phone call -- the recording that Mr. Cohen made of
23   President Trump.  Okay.  So you have a lawyer recording his
24   client, supposedly on September 6, 2016.  And I say
25   "supposedly," because there is a lot of dispute about that

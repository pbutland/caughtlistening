Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4671
1            Among other things, Mr. Trump told Cohen to use
2   his media relationships to help spin the Access Hollywood
3   tape as locker room talk.
4            A spin that Melania Trump had recommended.
5            Now, that second presidential debate took place
6   the next day, on October 9th, and as Ms. Hicks testified,
7   one of the first questions put to Mr. Trump was about that
8   Access Hollywood tape.
9            And, according to Hope Hicks, the defendant again
10   described his remark as locker room talk.  Just words.  Not
11   actions.
12            Hicks explained that after the debate additional
13   reports regarding Mr. Trump's behavior with women surfaced.
14   And Trump grew increasingly concerned about the impact that
15   these allegations were having on voters.  Particularly,
16   women voters.
17            He repeatedly addressed these concerns at rallies
18   and campaign events and on social media, eclipsing some of
19   the other campaign messaging and priorities.
20            You have to remember, this race could not have
21   been closer.  The Access Hollywood tape and the reports
22   that followed it were capable of costing him the whole
23   election, and he knew it.
24            Here's the defendant at a campaign rally in
25   Greensboro, North Carolina, on October 14th.

Summation/Mr. Blanche
4467
1 he told you a number of things on that witness stand that
2 were lies. Pure and simple.
3 Now, the records that we are talking about here
4 that are on the screen, those are not, as you all know, they
5 are not 2015 records, they are not 2016 records, these are
6 all records that were generated by folks in 2017 when
7 President Trump was in the White House.
8 You heard that when he was there, he was working
9 from early in the morning until late at night, as you would
10 expect.
11 And the checks that he signed, which we are going
12 to talk about, he signed when he was at the White House.
13 Now, there are two things that I expect that you
14 won't find as it relates to these documents.
15 First, is that the documents contained false
16 entries; and, second, that President Trump acted with an
17 intent to defraud.
18 Those are not the only two elements that are at
19 issue in this case, but those are the elements that are an
20 issue with the documents.
21 And I am going to start with these two because in
22 some ways you don't have to go further.
23 The records are not false, and there was no intent
24 to defraud.
25 So let's talk about the invoices.

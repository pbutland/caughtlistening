Proceedings
4459
1 Members of the jury, we will now hear the
2 summations of the lawyers.
3 Following their summations, I will instruct you on
4 the law and then you will begin your deliberations.
5 Under our law, Defense Counsel must sum up first
6 and the Prosecutor must follow.
7 The lawyers may not speak to you after that.
8 Summations provide each lawyer an opportunity to
9 review the evidence and submit for your consideration the
10 facts, inferences and conclusions that they contend may
11 properly be drawn from the evidence.
12 If you find that a lawyer has accurately summarized
13 and analyzed the evidence, and if you find that the
14 inferences and conclusions the lawyer asks you to draw from
15 that evidence are reasonable, logical and consistent with
16 the evidence, then you may adopt those inferences and
17 conclusions.
18 Members of the jury, please bear in mind the
19 following points:
20 First, you are the finders of fact.
21 And it is for you and you alone to determine the
22 facts from the evidence that you find to be truthful and
23 accurate.
24 Thus, you should remember that whatever the lawyers
25 say and however they say it, it is simply arguments

2 Howard tells Rodriguez he will get back to her.
3 Rodriguez is a little overzealous here and she
4 wrongly says that the sex happened on multiple occasions,
5 which is something Ms. Daniels has never said.
6 The following day, Howard lets Davidson know that
7 Rodriguez is shopping the story again.
8 And you have texts between Rodriguez and Howard
9 that are in evidence, and you ever seen them as People's
10 171A.
11 You basically see over the next few months
12 Rodriguez tries a few times to follow up, but Howard
13 doesn't seem particularly interested. No one is
14 particularly interested at this point. So there is nothing
15 to kill.
16 But, that changed on October 7th when the Access
17 Hollywood tape was released because that changed the whole
18 landscape.
19 Rodriguez didn't waste much time reaching back out
20 to Howard.
21 Remember, she is reaching out to Howard, not to
22 Cohen. Not to the defendant.
23 And Howard suddenly seems a lot more interested.
24 He tells her he needs to bring it to his CEO, which is
25 Pecker, and Pecker would likely pay.

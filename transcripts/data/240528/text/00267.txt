Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 Retainer Agreement contemplated. No one ever said
2 otherwise.

6 reimbursement as income pursuant to a retainer.
7 Maybe if they had actually created a phony
8 Retainer Agreement that would have given more cover to their
9 story, but it would have been just another false business
10 record, and you would have been considering 35 counts
11 instead of 34, because these payments had nothing to do with
12 the Retainer Agreement and nothing to do with services
13 rendered in 2017.
14 And, by the way, did you happen to notice that
15 Weisselberg approved the invoices without ever getting a
16 Retainer Agreement from Cohen?
17 They decided that the false invoices alone provided
18 sufficient cover, and they cut the checks every month
19 regardless.
20 Now, we've already seen those smoking gun
21 documents.
22 I'm not going to put that back up to show that they
23 add up to $420,000, paid out over 12 months in $35,000
24 installments.

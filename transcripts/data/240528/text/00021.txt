Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 And you can see what Mr. Davidson said in response
2 to questions about that.
3 There is nothing wrong with that. Meaning, there
4 is nothing wrong with the Retainer Agreement he had.
5 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
6 THE COURT: The objection is overruled.
7 MR. BLANCHE: Beyond Mr. Davidson, remember
8 Mr. McConney, who is not a lawyer. He just works for the
9 Trump Organization.
10 He told you the same thing regarding Retainer
11 Agreements and verbal Retainer Agreements.
12 By the way, ladies and gentlemen, there is no
13 dispute that in 2017 there was an attorney—client
14 relationship between Mr. Cohen and President Trump. Nobody
15 has told you differently.
16 He, meaning Mr. Cohen, was President Trump’s
17 personal lawyer. Period.
18 So, before we get to the vouchers, let’s just take
19 a step back.
20 Nobody disputes that Mr. Cohen was President
21 Trump’s personal lawyer in 2017.
22 So what makes more sense?
23 What makes more sense?
24 That President Trump was paying his Personal
25 Attorney in 2017 $35,000 a month pursuant to an Agreement

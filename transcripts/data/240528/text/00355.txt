Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4810
1 And I think this has been a really long summation,
2 and so I apologize for trading brevity for thoroughness, but
3 we only get one shot at this.
4 And, without jurors like you, willing to give up
5 their time, the system doesn't work.
6 So, the Defendant has the Constitutional right to a
7 fair trial.
8 He has the right to put the People, us, to our
9 burden and make them prove the case beyond a reasonable
10 doubt.
11 That right doesn't depend on the strength of the
12 case.
13 We don't say, well, you have the right to a trial,
14 but not if the case against you is so powerful.
15 MR. BLANCHE: Objection, your Honor.
16 THE COURT: Overruled.
17 MR. STEINGLASS: There are contracts and emails and
18 texts and audio recordings that corroborate every bit of
19 testimony, so we are just going to skip the trial.
20 He has a right to a trial, regardless.
21 But, in this particular case, the evidence is,
22 literally, overwhelming.
23 So, now he has gotten that trial. He's had his day
24 in court.
25 And, remember, as the Judge will tell you, and as

Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4808
1   election fraud.
2            And, second, Miss Cohen told you at the end of --
3   as of 2017, rather, the Defendant had already announced an
4   intention to run for President again.
5            Any single one of the unlawful means I just
6   mentioned, any one of the three FECA violations, any one of
7   the other false business records I just described, or the
8   City, State or Federal Tax Law violations, any single one of
9   those unlawful means is enough for you to conclude that the
10   Trump Tower conspiracy violated New York State Election Law.
11             The evidence powerfully supports the conclusion
12   that all these steps are unlawful.
13            But, just one is enough.
14            And, as the Judge will tell you, you don't have to
15   agree on which unlawful means were involved.
16            The Defendant's intent to defraud in this case
17   cannot be any clearer.
18            How easy would it have been for the Defendant to
19   just pay Stormy Daniels directly? Why not just do that?  One
20   single transaction.
21            Instead, the Defendant, Weisselberg and Cohen
22   devised this elaborate scheme, requiring the involvement of
23   at least ten other people, a series of monthly transactions,
24   secret FedEx packages back and forth.  That's a whole lot of
25   time, thought and energy to conceal the truth.

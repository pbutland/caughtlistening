Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4660
1 said it was interrupted by a live call, and the phone
2 records show the call was interrupted, the recording went
3 to voicemail. Seriously.
4 You could hear on the end of that recording, 1
5 think it was played for you on the defense summation, that
6 Cohen was clearly was trying to answer the phone and talked
7 to someone. So, maybe he tried to answer the call, but it
8 went to voicemail. Or, maybe he is just misremembering
9 that unbelievably, insignificant detail.
10 Which is funny, because it actually shows that
11 Mr. Cohen did not conform his testimony to the record
12 because it clearly says in the records that the call went
13 to voicemail. It was eventually routed to voicemail.
14 The larger point here, is that the phone records
15 corroborate his testimony that the recording stopped around
16 the same time as he got an incoming call.
17 Now, it should be perfectly obvious to you all
18 why they're so desperate to figure out a way to get you to
19 reject this piece of evidence, because this recording is
20 nothing short of jaw dropping.
21 (Whereupon, an audio recording was played in open
22 court.)
23 MR. STEINGLASS: This recording shows the
24 defendant's cavalier willingness to hide this payoff. It
25 shows he knew how much AMI paid for the McDougal deal.

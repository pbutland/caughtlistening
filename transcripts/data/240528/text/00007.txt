Summation/Mr. Blanche
4462
1       will be able to complete both sets of summations by 4:30.
2                I leave it to you to decide whether you would like
3       to work beyond 4:30 so that we can finish the second
4       summation.
5                Expect that if we do need to work beyond that time,
6       it won't be very long, perhaps an hour.  But I leave it to
7       you.
8                You discuss it.
9                You decide.
10                And you let me know what you would like to do.
11                If you decide that you don't want to work late
12       today, we will just finish it up tomorrow morning.
13                Having said that, we will now commence summations.
14                 Counsel.
15                MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you, your Honor.
16                I'm sorry, I am just confirming something.
17                All right.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
18                I hope that everybody had a nice, long weekend.
19                I want to start with something that I can say, I
20       think with confidence, that everybody inside this well
21       agrees with, which is just to thank you -- to thank you for
22       your jury service.
23                You guys, every one of you, have been here on time
24       and we see you paying close attention to the evidence all
25       day, every day, and we really appreciate that.

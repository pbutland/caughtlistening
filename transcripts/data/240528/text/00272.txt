Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4727
1 2018, confirmed that Donald Trump in 2017 had reimbursed
2 Michael Cohen's company Essential Consultants for the
3 $130,000 that was paid to you?"
4 "ANSWER: Yes, I saw that."
5 "QUESTION: So that was confirmed in Mr. Trump's
6 lawyer's submitted court papers; correct?"
7 "ANSWER: Correct."
8 Now, the defendant also admitted that in a filing
9 with the US Office of Government Ethics, a document that the
10 defendant signed and certified its accuracy.
11 The funny thing about this is that Mr. Blanche put
12 this up to say that, see, everything was above board, but
13 he's completely missing the point of the significance of
14 this document.
15 He wasn't charged with some ethical violation. He
16 made an admission in this document.
17 It's an unmistakable admission.
18 It says, quote, in the interest of transparency,
19 while not required to be disclosed as reportable liabilities
20 on Part 8, in 2016, expenses were incurred by one of Donald
21 J. Trump attorneys, Michael Cohen.
22 Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses,
23 and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.
24 The category of value would be $100,001 up to
25 $250,000 and the interest rate would be zero.

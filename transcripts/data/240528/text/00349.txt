4            MR. STEINGLASS:  (Continued.)  We've discussed ad
5   nauseum, I'm sorry, how AMI was acting way outside the scope
6   of a normal, legitimate press function -- even for tabloid
7   journalism.
8            Pecker put the campaign first -- to the point where
9   he was willing to sacrifice magazine sales to serve the
10   Defendant.
11            That was not business as usual by any stretch, and
12   the press exemption does not apply here.
13            Now, of course, in the case of Stormy Daniels --
14   there is no press exception any way -- but, it has zero
15   applicability whatsoever here because Stormy Daniels is not
16   a press entity.
17            Game over.
18            For the Daniels payoff, the FECA violation comes
19   from Cohen making and the Defendant accepting excessive
20   campaign contribution.
21            The Judge will tell you that in 2016, individuals
22   were only permitted to contribute $2,700 to a particular
23   campaign.
24            And, as the Judge will explain, paying a
25   candidate's expenses for them counts as a contribution to

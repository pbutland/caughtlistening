Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4719
1            "ANSWER:  Yes, ma'am."
2            "QUESTION:  Can you tell the jury a little bit
3   about that conversation?"
4            "ANSWER:  So, I was sitting with President Trump
5   and he asked me if I was okay.
6            He asked me if I needed money.  And I said no.  All
7   good.
8            He said, because I can get a check.  And I said,
9   no.  I said I'm okay.
10            He said, all right, just make sure you deal with
11   Allen."
12            "QUESTION:  Did he say anything about anything that
13   would be forthcoming?
14            "ANSWER:  Excuse me?
15            "QUESTION:  Did he say anything about what would be
16   forthcoming to you?
17            "ANSWER:  Yes.  It would be a check for January and
18   February."
19            So much for the Defense claim that there was no
20   evidence that they knew that Mr. Trump knew or had anything
21   to do with those first two checks.
22            Do you remember the January, February checks, they
23   came from The Trust.
24            There is evidence that Mr. Trump knew.  And it's
25   right here.

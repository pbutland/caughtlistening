Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 really a catch and kill conspiratorial relationship, why
2 did everybody ignore that story in April? Why did it not
3 go anywhere for months and months and months if there was
4 some catch and kill scheme? If these allegations by Ms.
5 Daniels were as damaging as Mr. Cohen would have you
6 believe or the Government would have you believe, why did
7 nobody do anything about it in April of 2016, when it first
8 resurfaced?
9 Mr. Howard didn't do anything. He didn't raise
10 any alarm bells.
11 There is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Rodriguez
12 outreached to him in April of 2016, which resulted in any
13 communication with Mr. Cohen or with President Trump.
14 So, let's look now to June of 2016. Dylan Howard
15 writes to Gina Rodriguez, "Not much pisses me off these
16 days except Donald Trump."
17 Now, there is no scenario under which Mr. Howard
18 can be said to be part of this conspiracy.
19 It appears he doesn't like President Trump at all.
20 He despises him.
21 So, right now in the middle of the election,
22 middle of 2016, Ms. Daniels and Ms. Rodriguez were kicking
23 off a plot again to try and get some money from President
24 Trump. And by this time the candidacy is in full swing,
25 the election is ongoing, and now they're being a lot more

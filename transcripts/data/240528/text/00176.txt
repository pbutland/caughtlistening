Summation/Steinglass

1            When you put all three of these components
2   together, this scheme cooked up by these men at this time
3   could very well be what got President Trump elected.
4            In the months and years that followed, three
5   separate catch and kills that we know of took place.
6            Mr. Blanche has an excuse for each of them, but
7   the excuse doesn't actually make any sense if you go
8   through the evidence.
9            Just a couple of months after that Trump Tower
10   meeting, this theory was put into practice with the case
11   of Dino Sajudin.
12            Dylan Howard got wind of a Trump Tower doorman,
13   Dino Sajudin, who was trying to sell a story of how
14   Mr. Trump fathered a child with one of his housekeepers.
15            You will recall, Howard was one of the Chief
16   Financial Officers and Editor-in-Chief with Mr. Pecker,
17   who told him: Let me know whenever you see a negative
18   Trump story.
19            Pecker suggested he wasn't a co-conspirator,
20   Dylan Howard didn't like Trump.
21            He had a boss, and his orders were: Tell me so we
22   can tell Cohen, so whenever there's a Trump story, we can
23   kill it.
24            That makes him a co-conspirator, whether he
25   wanted to be or not.

Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 This was a very confusing time for the Trump
2 Organization.
3 There were adjustments that were being made. Not a
4 surprise.
5 And, exactly, so, why does that matter?
6 Well, it matters because, as Mr. McConney said,
7 initially they wanted to pay Mr. Cohen out of The Trust.
8 There was some flux and chaos at the time because President
9 Trump had just, for the first time in decades, not been the
10 person running The Trump Organization.
11 So, let's look at that same email, a little bit
12 further down. "OK to pay as per agreement with Don and
13 Eric."
14 Now, who are Don and Eric? You all know who they
15 are, they are President Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Donald
16 Trump Jr.
17 They were two of the three people that were running
18 the company, right, while President Trump was in Office.
19 If their —— this is one of the charged documents
20 that President Trump is charged with a felony, okay.
21 If there was some sort of conspiratorial agreement,
22 as the People have suggested, between President Trump to
23 Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Weisselberg, if there was actually an
24 Agreement between the three of them to pay Michael Cohen as
25 a cover up, this email does not exist. There is no reason

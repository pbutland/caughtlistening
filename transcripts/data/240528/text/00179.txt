1 you, was not on redirect. This was on direct. This came
2 out right at the first time around.
3 This is what I mean when 1 say you‘ve got to look
4 at the contents; right. You can't take an isolated
5 question that is put up on the screen and assume that
6 that's the whole story, because there's more to it; right.
7 So, yes, it's true, Mr. Blanche, that Pecker said
8 that he would print the story anyway, but he would wait
9 until after the election because that's what they agreed
10 to do. Because even though it would be better off for AMI,
11 they would sell more magazines in the short—term, they
12 risked getting scooped if they waited until after the
13 election, they were willing to wait because that would
14 help the Defendant's campaign. And that's the only reason.
15 That is catch and kill.
16 So, as you know, AMI reporters conducted their
17 investigation. And, as I said, it turned out the story was
18 not true.
19 But, guess what's interesting. Even though the
20 story was not true, AMI shelled out $30,000 for no
21 legitimate purpose.
22 They had already done their investigation by
23 then.
24 If you remember, the original Agreement said,
25 "Payment due upon publication."

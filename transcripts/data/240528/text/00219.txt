Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 extramarital sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.
2 Stormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder
3 that the defendant was not only words. She would have
4 totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the
5 Access Hollywood tape.
6 So letâ€˜s back up for a minute.
7 In April, and then again on June 28th, Gina
8 Rodriguez, Stormy Daniels' manager, reached out to Howard
9 about the Daniels story.
10 And she made it clear that Ms. Daniels was willing
11 to share the story of her sexual encounter with the
12 defendant, with the press.
13 And this is the story that was already out there.
14 It was already out there in a gossip column in 2011, with
15 no firsthand account, and it was taken down after Keith
16 Davidson and Michael Cohen got involved to have the story
17 removed.
18 This is nothing like one of the two parties to a
19 sexual encounter going public with the details of that
20 sexual encounter.
21 Ms. Rodriguez refers to the fact that Mr. Trump
22 promised Ms. Daniels a spot on The Apprentice, but never
23 delivered.
24 She tells Howard that Daniels met the defendant at
25 a celebrity golf tournament when she was there with Wicked

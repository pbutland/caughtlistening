Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1   back before the date so he could, like, change his records
2   and make this all look legit.
3            So, in order to convince Pecker that Mr. Trump
4   would make good, Cohen taped the conversation with him.
5            And the defense has gone to laughable lengths in a
6   feeble attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of this
7   recording.
8            They suggested that the evidence wasn't handled
9   properly by the investigator who gathered it from Cohen, or
10   because it wasn't immediately put into a Faraday bag.
11            Do you remember that ridiculous cross-examination?
12   Someone who is, like, going to beam these air radio waves
13   onto the phone and plant this conversation on the
14   investigator's way down the FDR.
15            Or, it's not reliable because Cohen continues to
16   use the phone after making the recording.
17            Here's a news flash:  People use their phones;
18   right?  If subsequent use of a phone made any evidence on
19   that phone invalid, then the only useful thing on the phone
20   would be the last thing that that phone did.
21            People use their phones all the time.  They do
22   delete things from their phone all the time.
23            They suggested that migrating this data on the
24   phone from one phone to another using iTunes, that somehow
25   made the information unreliable.  How many times have you

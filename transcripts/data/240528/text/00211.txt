Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4666
1 THE COURT: Mr. Steinglass.
2 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.
3 So four weeks before the election, the campaign
4 was brought to its core by the release of the Access
5 Hollywood tape. And all of a sudden there was a video of a
6 presidential nominee literally discussing grabbing women by
7 the genitals.
8 And Mr. Blanche told you that the only evidence
9 that the Access Hollywood tape was a significant event came
10 from Michael Cohen.
11 But, that's just wrong. It's another example of
12 them trying to make the case about Michael Cohen, when it
13 isn't.
14 Hope Hicks told you that the news was so explosive
15 that it eclipsed the coverage of a Category Four hurricane
16 that was bearing down on the East Coast. I guess this was
17 like a Category Five hurricane.
18 Prominent Republican leaders rushed to condemn
19 Mr. Trump's words. Some even withdrew their endorsements.
20 Madeleine Westerhout testified that the RNC began
21 discussing the possibility of replacing Mr. Trump as the
22 Republican nominee four weeks before the election.
23 Preparations for the second presidential debate
24 only two weeks away were halted as key campaign officials
25 entered damage control mode.

1 the $130,000 to Davidson and the $50,000 to Red Finch.
2 It says: Gross up to $360,000.
3 Now, this is not Michael Cohen telling you that
4 this was grossed up. This is in the document itself, gross
5 up.
6 Mr. McConney testified that he understood this to
7 mean, doubling to offset taxes.
8 And the Defense showed you another line from that
9 out of context that seemed to suggest that Michael Cohen
10 didn't know why this was being grossed up.
11 We didn't have time to make a slide over lunch,
12 but here is what Michael Cohen actually said.
13 This is an answer.
14 Then he told me that he was going to do —— it's
15 called gross it up, because I was taking —— because I was
16 taking it as income. And in order to get back the 180, you
17 need to actually double it because of tax purposes.
18 Because I was in the 50 percent tax bracket City, State and
19 Federal. So, in order to get back the 180, what he did was
20 then he wrote down 360.
21 Question: Did he tell you that he wanted to
22 gross up that number of 180 to 360?
23 Answer: Yes.
24 Question: And what was your understanding about
25 why he said he needed to gross up 360,000?

7 MR. STEINGLASS: We discussed this at great length
8 in the Motions in Limine on April 22nd. And what your
9 Honor said then was that the evidence of threats that Ms.
10 Daniels has received, that Mr. Cohen has received, are
11 admissible as to their state of mind if the defense opens
12 the door.
13 They did open the door, wide enough to drive a
14 truck through, by arguing not only that they're generally
15 incredible, but by also arguing that they're somehow
16 profiting from their cooperation in the case. That they're
17 just rolling in doe.
18 What they're really rolling in is fear.

22 summation.
23 1 am not trying to suggest that it was Mr. Trump
24 that was orchestrating these threats. The point is, that
25 by saying things like he does, that has the effect of

Summation/Steinglass

1   billionaire knows: He's in the details, and you need to be
2   there too. I couldn't run a business any other way. When
3   I'm talking to a contractor or examining a site or
4   planning a new development, no detail is too small to
5   consider. I even try to sign as many checks as possible.
6   For me, there's nothing worse than a computer signing
7   checks. When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing
8   what's really going on inside your business, and if people
9   see your signature at the bottom of the check, they know
10   you're watching them, and they screw you less because they
11   have proof that you care about the details."
12            That's his philosophy.
13            Along those lines, David Pecker described an
14   occasion where he saw Ms. Graff bring a stapled packet of
15   stamped checks and invoices, and he watched the Defendant
16   review the invoices along with the checks and sign.
17            Now, the Defendant created the protocols at The
18   Trump Organization with these characteristics in mind.
19   This was his company, and his philosophy was to check and
20   double-check everything.
21            And for the DJT entity checks, remember, the
22   Defendant was the only one who ever could sign them.
23            For all the other checks, it depended on the
24   dollar amount.

Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1   try to discredit her?
2            What I'm saying is that her story is messy.  It
3   makes people uncomfortable to hear.  It probably made some
4   of you uncomfortable to hear.  But, that's kind of the
5   point.  That's the display the Defendant didn't want the
6   American voter to see.
7            In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the
8   motive.
9            And you can bet Mr. Trump would not pay $130,000,

20            And while he was still in the Trump camp, he openly
21   denied and misled the press, the FEC and the SEC about some
22   of the same things we heard here.
23            And Mr. Colangelo told you the same thing.  He told
24   you about some of the mistakes that he made.
25            And we all agree and still agree that those are

5            MR. BLANCHE:  Now, as I just said, it matters
6   where President Trump was during this time.
7            He was constantly moving. He was very busy. He
8   was frequently multitasking. People were constantly
9   interrupting him. He was President of the United States.
10            So, the idea -- the leap that the Government
11   wants you to take that he looked at the checks, looked at
12   the invoices, and was part of the scheme -- and remember
13   what the scheme is: to book a legal expense as a "legal
14   expense"; that's the scheme.
15            That he somehow was in on that is absurd.
16            And, again, this is where Ms. Westerhout told you
17   that sometimes he would sign checks even when he was
18   meeting with people, while he was on the phone, and even
19   without reviewing them.
20            Again, nothing surprising there, but it's worth
21   remembering.
22            Now, we're going to talk for just a few minutes
23   now about Mr. Cohen.
24            How is the Government going to ask you to convict
25   President Trump based on the words of Michael Cohen?

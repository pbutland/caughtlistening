1             In fact, McConney testified that they spoke
2   twice.  He said during their first meeting, if you
3   remember, Weisselberg tossed him a pad, and he started
4   taking notes about what Weisselberg was saying.
5             And McConney testified that some time afterwards,
6   Weisselberg gave him that bank statement with the
7   handwriting on it and that's the same bank statement that
8   Cohen and Weisselberg wrote on and brought in to the
9   Defendant.
10             So this was from McConney's testimony:
11             Question:  Directing your attention to the time
12   period around January 2017, did you became aware that
13   Mr. Cohen needed to be reimbursed for money he was owed.
14             Answer:  Yes.
15             Question:  How did you first became aware?
16             Answer:  I had a conversation with Allen
17   Weisselberg.

19             Question:  Please describe the conversation that
20   you had.
21             Answer:  Allen said to me he had to get some
22   money to Michael, reimburse Michael.  He tossed a pad
23   towards me, and I started taking notes on what Allen said.
24             Now, just pause for a moment to consider what
25   this testimony means.

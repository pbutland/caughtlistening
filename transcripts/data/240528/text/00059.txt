1 The reason they didn't publish this story, by the
2 way, was it catch and kill? No. It's because it was
3 false. The story was not true. That's why it was never
4 published.
5 So, if you look at the original Agreement between
6 AMI and Mr. Sajudin, dated November 15, 2015, totally
7 standard document as you heard, nothing unusual, they were
8 going to pay $30,000 if they published the story. Nothing
9 unusual. That's the way the National Enquirer normally did
10 it. And a 90—day period of exclusivity.
11 Again, Mr. Pecker told you that was all standard.
12 So, AMI is just doing what it always does.
13 Then what happened?
14 A little bit later, in December of that same
15 year, they amended the Agreement; and under the Amendment,
16 AMI owed $30,000 to Mr. Sajudin, and they paid it. And
17 it lasted forever. This Agreement never expired.
18 And Mr. Sajudin could never talk about it, or he
19 would owe a lot of money.
20 And what did Mr. Pecker tell you about why —— why
21 they did this, why they switched and actually paid him the
22 money, without actually writing a story? He told you that
23 Mr. Sajudin was threatening to go someplace else, and they
24 had to see if that story was true. So, if they didn't
25 agree to pay him $30,000, there was a risk he would go

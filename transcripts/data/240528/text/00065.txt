Summation/Blanche

1 MR. BLANCHE: Let's go to what he said.
2 He said that he submitted a declaration under ——
3 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
4 THE COURT: Overruled.
5 MR. BLANCHE: —— under penalty of perjury.
6 "And this is a declaration of legal advise that
7 you had received relating to the Agreement with Karen
8 McDougal; correct?"
9 "Yes."
10 And it said that the Agreement was lawful.
11 So, he told you that he didn't keep anything from
12 his lawyers when he talked about it. He told you that on
13 cross.
14 And you can see that here.
15 And, also, you know that Mr. Pecker has an
16 Agreement with the District Attorney, with the Prosecutors
17 in this case that provided him with immunity.
18 And you can see that. It's in evidence.
19 You see the paragraph that is applicable to what
20 we're talking about now: That if the District Attorney, if
21 the Prosecutor determines Mr. Pecker provided any false,
22 incomplete or misleading testimony, that the Agreement is
23 then breached and that he could be subject to prosecution.
24 But, you know Mr. Pecker is not being prosecuted
25 for anything. You know that.

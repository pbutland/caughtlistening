Summation/Steinglass
4762
1   other things, making an excessive campaign contribution in
2   violation of FECA in connection with the Daniels matter.
3            And this is from Cohen's testimony:
4            "Question: And on August 21, 2018, did you plead
5   guilty to one count of making an excessive campaign
6   contribution in violation of the Federal Election Campaign
7   Act?"
8            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
9            THE COURT:  Approach.
10            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
11   at sidebar:)
12            THE COURT:  What's your objection?
13            MR. BLANCHE:  This is the fourth or fifth time
14   that the fact that Mr. Cohen pled guilty to a campaign
15   finance charge is coming up.
16            And we've briefed this before.
17            We didn't even bring up his guilty pleas on our
18   summation for this very reason. Didn't bring up one time
19   any of his guilty pleas.
20            For the People to now read out his allocution on
21   this charge is completely inappropriate given the fact
22   that it's only limited; the only reason why it came into
23   evidence was for his credibility and to explain why, you
24   know, some other amorphous idea -- this is extremely
25   prejudicial and inappropriate.

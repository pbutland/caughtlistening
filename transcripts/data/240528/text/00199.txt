Summation/Steinglass
4654
1            "Question: When you say 'we', who is 'we'?"
2            "Answer: Myself and Michael Cohen."
3            "Question:  But for Mr. Cohen's promise that
4   Mr. Trump would reimburse AMI, would you have entered into
5   this Agreement?"
6            "Answer: No."
7            And you know from the discussion at the Trump
8   Tower meeting that everyone understood Cohen was acting as
9   the liaison with Pecker, Mr. Trump's liaison with Pecker,
10   conveying Mr. Trump's instructions every step of the way.
11            Many of the facts in those questions and answers
12   that I just read to you are also contained in the
13   Statement of Admitted Facts that was part of the
14   Non-Prosecution Agreement that AMI executed with the
15   Southern District of New York.
16            That's in evidence, and you can examine it
17   whenever you like.
18            It was admitted to assist you in assessing
19   Mr. Pecker's credibility and, also, to provide context for
20   the surrounding events.
21            It sounded to me like maybe Mr. Blanche was
22   trying to suggest in his summation that maybe AMI admitted
23   to these campaign finance violations because they were in
24   a rush to get some other deal done.
25            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection, your Honor.

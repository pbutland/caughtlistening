Summation/Mr. Blanche
4472
1 he said, in response to the question: "How would you
2 characterize the amount of work that you did generally on
3 that matter, if any?"
4 "Very minimal."
5 But then on cross when he was confronted with
6 documents, he indicated that he was lead counsel, coâ€”lead
7 counsel on that matter.
8 And in response to a question about whether that
9 was taking a fair amount of his time to work on that,
10 Mr. Cohen said, "Yes."
11 And that's just two examples of what Mr. Cohen was
12 doing for President Trump in 2017.
13 He tried to call it minimal. It wasn't. But even
14 if it was minimal, even if the amount of work that Mr. Cohen
15 was doing for President Trump in 2017 was minimal, there was
16 a Retainer Agreement. And that's how Retainer Agreements
17 work.
18 You heard that. You heard that from Mr. Cohen when
19 he talked about all of the other consulting Retainer
20 Agreements that he had.
21 Do you remember he told you about one with
22 Novartis?
23 Novartis paid him $100,000 a month for 12 months,
24 that's $1.2 million.
25 And he told you he had six interactions with them.

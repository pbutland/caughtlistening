Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4599
1 Defendant held accountable. They are angry with the
2 Defendant and, frankly, want to see him convicted.
3 They have been attacked by the Defendant on social
4 media and, as a result, they have incurred the wrath of his
5 most fiery supporters.
6 The Defense has gone to great lengths to discredit
7 Stormy Daniels and her account of her sexual involvement
8 with Mr. Trump. They shamed her.
9 They have tried to suggest that her story has
10 changed over the years.
11 It has not. At least not in any way that's
12 significant.
13 Her false denials have been thoroughly discussed
14 and explained.
15 And when she didn't actually —— she lived in 2017
16 in pure silence.
17 She was perfectly happy going along, but when Cohen
18 came out and he started saying that the sex never happened,
19 she felt compelled to go forward. She wanted to get her
20 story out.
21 They demonized her as someone who makes a living
22 off of the Defendant.
23 To be sure, there were parts of her testimony that
24 were cringe—worthy, because that whole episode in the suite
25 at Harrah's, that was uncomfortable.

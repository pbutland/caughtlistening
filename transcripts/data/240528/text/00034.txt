7 The fact that the invoices refer to a verbal

9 attorneyâ€”client relationship between President Trump and
10 Michael Cohen in 2017, the fact that the invoices talk

12 that he was rendering services during that time in 2017,
13 all that ends the case "not guilty".
14 But, there is a lot more.
15 What the People have done, what the Government
16 did for the past five weeks, at the end of the day, is ask
17 you to believe the man who testified two weeks ago,
18 Michael Cohen.
19 Michael Cohen asked you to ignore the documents,
20 ignore what the email says about sending him a Retainer

22 was just going to work for free.
23 You saw him on the stand for three days, more
24 than three days.
25 Do you believe that for a second? That after

Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4612
1 And we know from People's Exhibit 417B and the
2 stipulations of the parties —— this is People's 417B —— that
3 the Defendant and Mr. Schiller were together, getting off
4 the stage at a rally in Tampa at 7:57 p.m., five minutes
5 before the phone call.
6 (Displayed.)
7 MR. STEINGLASS: So, they were together at the
8 exact date and time that Mr. Cohen said they were together.
9 We also know that prior to the call, Cohen texted
10 Schiller about harassing calls he was getting —— he had been
11 getting to his home and office, and he told Schiller that
12 the caller forgot to the block his phone number.
13 So, forgive me for a minute.
14 Let's try a little experiment.
15 I will be Cohen.
16 Hey, Keith. How's it going? It seems like this
17 prankster might be a 14—year—old kid. If I text you the
18 number, can you call and talk to his family? See if you can
19 let them know how serious this is, it's not a joke.
20 Uh—huh. Yeah. All right.
21 Thanks, pal.
22 Hey, is The Boss near you?
23 Can you pass him the phone for a minute?
24 I will just wait a couple of seconds.

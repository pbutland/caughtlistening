Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4610
1   from his Tax Form and his HELOC application.
2            But he feels like he was treated unfairly.  That's
3   what he told you.
4            He feels like as a first offender, he should have
5   been given a chance to pay the fines and his back taxes.
6            And he thinks that other people in his shoes would
7   have been given the chance to do so.
8            He believes that the Trump Justice Department did
9   him dirty.
10            Whether that's true or not, he was very forthright
11   about the conduct that he committed, and he accepted
12   responsibility for it.
13            And he went to prison for it, along with the
14   Campaign Finance Violations.
15            So, you should consider all of these things in
16   assessing his credibility.
17            But, just ask yourselves whether they cause you to
18   outright shut your ears to anything else that he has to
19   say?
20            One of the things that Defense accuses him of doing
21   is lying to Congress.
22            And that's kind of rich.  Because the lies that he
23   told to Congress in 2017 had to do with the Mueller
24   Investigation, and it had to do with the investigation into
25   the Russia probe.

Summation/Blanche

1   defraud by President Trump, when he discloses it to the
2   IRS, he Tweets about it, and he submits it on his Office
3   of Government Ethics Forms?
4            So, I'm going to talk a little bit now about what
5   I expect the Government will talk about, which is a
6   conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.
7            I don't even think you have to get to this,
8   because with what we just talked about, with the way the
9   Forms were filed, the way that they were booked on
10   President Trump's personal records, there's no crime.
11   Period.
12            But, even if -- even if you get to ask yourself
13   about any conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, I
14   expect that you will find President Trump is not guilty.
15            Now, the Government's theory is that in 2017 --
16   so, after the election; the election is November 2016 --
17   President Trump caused false filings, which we just talked
18   about, to be made on books of his personal records to
19   promote a candidacy in an election that he had already
20   won.
21            The charges relate to documents in 2017.
22            And the Government wants you to believe that
23   President Trump did these things with his records to
24   conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in
25   2016, the year before.

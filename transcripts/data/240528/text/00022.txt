Summation/Mr. Blanche

1       that he made, that President Trump made with his Personal
2       Attorney, right before he took Office.  It makes perfect
3       sense.  Or the version that Mr. Cohen came in here and told
4       you?  Which is that, no, no, no, no, no, I was not paid, I
5       was going to work for free.  Now, I didn't tell anybody
6       that, but in the back of my head, what I thought is I will
7       just work for free and make a lot of money as a consultant
8       and the $35,000 a month is not really for my retainer fee,
9       it's actually an overpayment for the hundred and thirty
10       thousand dollars that President Trump was paying me back
11       because of the NDA.
12                For the first time in President Trump's life, he
13       decided to pay me back triple.
14                He doubled up the 130.  He gave me 50,000 for some
15       online poll that he had decided he wasn't going to pay for
16       for over a year, which, by the way, I stole from him a
17       little bit on that, and decided I wanted a bigger bonus, so
18       I got an extra 60 grand on the bonus.  That's not what
19       really happened, ladies and gentlemen.
20                There is a reason why -- there is a reason why in
21       life, usually the simplest answer is the right one -- and
22       that's certainly the case here -- that the story that
23       Mr. Cohen told you on that witness stand, is not true.
24       That, really, he was paid $35,000 a month by President Trump
25       to be his attorney in 2017.

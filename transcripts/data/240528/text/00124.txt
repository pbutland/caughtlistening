Summation/Mr. Blanche

1   IMEI on Cohen's phone, CP1, ended in 997431.
2            It's a different phone.
3            Cohen made up that call.  He made up how it was
4   received.
5            And there is nothing you can trust about anything
6   he said to you about what happened with that recording.
7            And the last thing I'm going to talk about that
8   gives you reasonable doubt is what I have been talking about
9   for the past several hours:  Michael Cohen.  He's the human
10   embodiment of reasonable doubt.  Literally.
11            He lied to you repeatedly.  He lied many, many,
12   many times before you even met him.
13            His financial and personal wellbeing depends on
14   this case.
15            He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that
16   is not true.
17            The kind of witness that you want to testify -- to
18   take an oath and testify is somebody that you can trust that
19   they are telling you something to the best of their
20   recollection.  Period.
21            That's what we want from all of our witnesses.
22            Most of the witnesses that testified over the past
23   five weeks, I think you got that.  Most of them.
24            But, with Michael Cohen, you did not.
25            So, there is something -- do you guys -- have you

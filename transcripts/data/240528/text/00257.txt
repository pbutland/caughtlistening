1             Answer:  Because otherwise you wouldn't get back
2   your 180.  It would be, obviously, less.  If they gave me
3   the 180, and I didn't gross it up, after taxes onto it, it
4   would be 90.  That is -- and then that's, again, assuming
5   that you take it as income as opposed to just a wash.
6             So, not the one line that Mr. Blanche showed you,
7   but the rest of his testimony makes it very clear that
8   Michael Cohen was very clear about what they were doing
9   here in grossing up this reimbursement.
10             And that's also what McConney told you that he
11   understood this doubling to be, to offset taxes.
12             Add another $60,000, for a total of $420,000,
13   divided by 12 equals 35,000 per month, effective February
14   1st, 2017.
15             And on the right of the screen you have the notes
16   that McConney is scribbling on that pad while Weisselberg
17   details just how he, the Defendant and Cohen are going to
18   commit this crime.
19             They are acting in concert, and the Judge will
20   explain this concept to you.
21             So, these are his notes.  Cohen will get a bonus
22   of 50,000.  He will be repaid the 180,000 we owe him.
23             And unlike what Mr. Blanche told you, McConney
24   specifically testified that he understood the 180,000 on
25   his handwritten note to be the same 180,000 from the notes

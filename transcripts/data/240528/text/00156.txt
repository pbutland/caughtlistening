Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4611
1 And what Michael Cohen lied about was the number of
2 dealings that the Defendant had with Russia.
3 And he got no benefit for that, other than staying
4 in the Defendant's good graces as part of a Joint Defense
5 Agreement.
6 And so, now those lies that he told are being used
7 by that same Defendant to undermine his credibility.
8 That's what some people might call chutzpah.
9 And that brings us to the phone call on October
10 24th at 8:02 p.m. in which Cohen testified that he called to
11 speak with Mr. Trump.
12 And it turns out that, at first, he was speaking to
13 Mr. Schiller about getting harassing calls.
14 And, of course, the Defense says: Aha, that‘s
15 perjury. That's —— the only interpretation of that is that
16 he's lying.
17 That's the only interpretation that they want you
18 to consider.
19 To them, that is the big lie.
20 But that's not the only interpretation.
21 Cohen clearly did not remember the initial reason
22 for the call.
23 And when he saw the text with Mr. Schiller, he
24 acknowledged that he had also spoken with Schiller on that
25 call.

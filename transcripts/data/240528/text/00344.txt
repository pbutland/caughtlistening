Summation/Steinglass

1 But, he set in motion a chain of events that led
2 to the creation of the false business records. The
3 Defendant caused the creation of the false business
4 records when he approved the reimbursement scheme for the
5 Stormy Daniels payoff, and he knew that the reimbursements
6 would be processed in exactly the same way that The Trump
7 Organization had long processed such payments, because he
8 had always been immersed in those details by choice.
9 So, he acted in concert to create the false
10 entries in the vouchers and the invoices.
11 And he acted in concert to create the false
12 checks and check stubs from The Trust.
13 And he, personally, signed the false DJT checks
14 himself.
15 So, this is kind of a noâ€”brainer in this case.
16 We've also discussed the meaning of "enterprise"
17 and how the DJT entity, The Trust, and The Trump
18 Organization itself all satisfy that very broad
19 definition.
20 And, as I said before, this chart is kind of a
21 handy summary of each of the false business records and
22 which count of the indictment they correspond to.
23 As to the "intent to defraud", the judge will
24 explain to you what "intent" means: conscious objective or
25 purpose.

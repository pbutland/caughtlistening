Summation/Mr. Blanche
4532
1 have no idea whether President Trump was saying; Check with
2 my people, check to verify it.
3 It's not talking about a check, like write me a
4 check to pay me back.
5 It's clearly talking about the beginning of a
6 sentence that we will never know —— we will never know what
7 was said.
8 So, let‘s talk about how this call ends. Let's
9 listen to the end of the recording.
10 (Whereupon, an audio recording was played in open
11 court.)
12 MS. BLANCHE: So, there is a comment by Mr. Cohen
13 at the end of the recording. It's not on the transcript.
14 He says hi to somebody. Maybe it's Don, maybe it's D—O—N,
15 maybe it's D—A—W—N, it's not clear.
16 It's not what he told you; hello, are you there.
17 He told you that he got a phone call. He told you that he
18 knew who the call was from. It was from somebody that
19 worked at a bank. That's what he told you. He said that
20 it was someone named Cathy Battle. He said that he
21 interrupted —— he interrupted this super secret
22 conversation that he's recording with his client, with
23 President Trump, to answer a phone call from Cathy Battle,
24 who is apparently a bank manager at Capital One. That
25 story alone is ridiculous. But, it gets much worse for

Summation/Steinglass

1   Ms. Tarasoff.
2            Before 2015, Weisselberg could sign checks up to
3   $2,500. After 2015, when the Defendant was on the campaign
4   trail, the number was increased to $10,000.
5            Ms. Tarasoff also testified that Mr. Trump
6   sometimes sent checks back unsigned and handwrote the word
7   "void" on it.
8            And, of course, that certainly suggests that he
9   was reviewing these checks before signing them.
10            So, this chart is in evidence as People's 350.
11            You can have it if you ask for it.
12            It shows kind of the sum total of false business
13   records in this case, a total of 11 false invoices, 12
14   false vouchers, and 11 false checks and check stubs. Each
15   of these false business records correspond to a count in
16   the indictment. That's also indicated on this chart, which
17   false business record pertains to which count.
18            Now, the false records were designed to cover up
19   the Defendant's and his cohorts' efforts to corrupt the
20   election.
21            But, there was also a coverup of the coverup.
22            Because on January 12, 2018, The Wall Street
23   Journal broke the story that Cohen, Trump's lawyer, had
24   brokered a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to ensure
25   her silence in the weeks before the 2016 election.

Summation/Mr. Blanche

1            (Whereupon, the proceedings were continued from
2   previous page.)
3            ***
4            MR. BLANCHE:  So nothing that Mr. Pecker told you
5   about the Ms. McDougal transaction, the contract, what
6   happened afterwards, what happened with the decisions that
7   were made by AMI afterwards, none of that, none of that was
8   criminal.  He told you that because it's true.
9            So, I want to talk for just a minute about AMI's
10   Non-Prosecution Agreement.  And I know we're going back a
11   few weeks, so, remember, Mr. Pecker told you that at the
12   time this Agreement was entered into, the National
13   Enquirer, AMI was in the process of being bought, there was
14   a proposed deal, and that this investigation, the
15   investigation into the McDougal situation had to be cleaned
16   up.  He told you, yes, that's correct.
17            So, remember, there was a resolution.  AMI entered
18   into a Non-Prosecution Agreement.  No dispute about that.
19            But, remember what Judge Merchan told you about
20   that Agreement; that Agreement, AMI's Non-Prosecution
21   Agreement, the Conciliatory Agreement that they entered
22   into at the same time is evidence of nothing as relates to
23   President Trump's guilt.
24            MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
25            THE COURT:  Sustained.  Please rephrase.

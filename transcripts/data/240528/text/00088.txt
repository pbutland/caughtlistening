Summation - Defense/Blanche
4543
1   is a conspiratorial arrangement as charged by the
2   Government or something else.  And that's why we are going
3   through all of this evidence right now.
4             And remember, both, repeatedly -- Ms. Daniels has
5   denied, has denied that there was ever any sex with
6   President Trump in 2018, and earlier before that.  And we
7   can look at those statements here, but what did you hear
8   about those statements?
9             The Government wants you to believe that those
10   statements were coerced, that Ms. Daniels was either forced
11   to sign them or didn't really have a say in signing them.
12             But think about something.  She, Ms. Daniels,
13   decided to go public after these statements, supposedly
14   because she was trying to protect herself from what she
15   said was a threat someone made to her in a gym parking lot
16   in 2011, so five years before.
17             But, there are recordings where you know that
18   that's just not true.
19             Mr. Davidson told Mr. Cohen directly in 2018,
20   that Mr. Avenatti, who you remember ended up being Ms.
21   Daniels lawyer, Gina Rodriguez and Ms. Daniels were lying
22   about these threats.
23             They never happened.
24             But, the recording makes clear that Ms. Daniels
25   lied to you about it.

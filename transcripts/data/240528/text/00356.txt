Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4811
1   Mr. Blanche told you, the law is the law, and it applies to
2   everyone equally.
3            There is no special standard for this Defendant.
4            Donald Trump can't shoot someone during rush hour
5   on 5th Avenue and get away with it.
6            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection, your Honor.
7            THE COURT:  Sustained.
8            MR. STEINGLASS:  You, the jury, have the ability to
9   hold the Defendant accountable.
10            And, like in any other case, he can be judged by a
11   jury of his peers, based on the evidence and nothing else.
12             Remember, you are the ones who have the opportunity
13   to observe every witness and see each document.
14            You have to put aside the distractions, the press,
15   the politics, the noise, and focus on the evidence and the
16   logical inferences that can be drawn from that evidence.
17              Use your common sense, and follow the Judge's
18   legal instructions, which he is going to give you tomorrow,
19   I hope.
20            Very soon there will be time to go deliberate and
21   to review any testimony or exhibits that you need to and to
22   come back in here and say "guilty", "guilty" of 34 counts of
23   Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree to cover up
24   a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 election.
25            In the interest of justice, and in the name of the
Lisa Kramsky,

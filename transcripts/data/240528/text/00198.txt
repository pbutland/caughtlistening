1   was signed by both McDougal and by Howard, the Chief

7            I'll just read it to you.
8            "Question: Were you aware that expenditures by
9   corporations made for the purpose of influencing an
10   election, made in coordination with or at the request of a
11   candidate or a campaign, are unlawful?"
12            "Answer: Yes."
13            "Question: Did either you or AMI ever report to
14   the Federal Election Commission in 2016 that AMI had made
15   a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal?"
16            "Answer: No, we did not."
17            "Question: Why did AMI make this purchase of
18   Karen McDougal's story?"
19            "Answer: We purchased the story so it wouldn't be
20   published by any other organization."
21            "Question: And why did you not want it to be
22   published by any other organization?"
23            "Answer: I didn't want -- we didn't want the
24   story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the
25   campaign."

1 getting stiffed on his bonus in 2016, when he thought he
2 had worked so hard and he got stiffed, when he didn't get
3 paid back the 20,000 he was owed, do you think that
4 Mr. Cohen thought: I want to work for free; is that the
5 man who testified, or was that a lie?
6 Now, when we get to Mr. Cohen's testimony, about
7 the issue we're talking about, about the Retainer
8 Agreement, about what he was going to do with it in 2017,
9 just remember something. It's not corroborated by
10 anything. There‘s not a shred of evidence.
11 What Mr. Cohen told us is that first he talked to
12 Mr. Weisselberg privately, and then they walked down the
13 hall, unscheduled, unannounced, walked into the office of
14 the President—Elect of the United States, who was
15 preparing to be inaugurated just a few days later. And
16 what he wants you to believe, what Mr. Cohen wants you to
17 believe, that he just sat back, Mr. Cohen did, didn't
18 really participate in the conversation.
19 And you can see what he said about it on the
20 screen:
21 "At some point during this conversation,"
22 apparently between the President and Allen Weisselberg,
23 "he turned around and said to me, ummm, while we were
24 talking about this, it was —— and what we're going to do
25 is, we're going to pay you over 12 months."

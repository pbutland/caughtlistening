Summation/Mr. Blanche
4465
1 extent President Trump, while he was living in the White
2 House, as the leader of the free world, whether he had
3 anything to do with how payments to Michael Cohen, his
4 Personal Attorney at the time, were booked on his personal
5 account and ledger at Trump Tower.
6 Is the booking of legal expenses on the personal
7 ledger of President Trump accurate? Were the —— were those
8 bookings done with an intent to defraud?
9 That’s why you are here.
10 And the answer to that, to those questions are
11 absolutely, positively, not.
12 The bookings were accurate, and there was
13 absolutely no intent to defraud.
14 And, beyond that, there was no conspiracy —— no
15 conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by President
16 Trump, the folks at AMI, Michael Cohen. The proof there
17 doesn’t add up, and we are going to talk about that this
18 morning.
19 Let’s talk about the evidence.
20 I'm going to try to use a pointer, and if I fail,
21 then Mr. Sitko will stand in for us.
22 (Whereupon, a Power Point presentation containing
23 exhibits and transcript excerpts are shown on the screens
24 throughout the entirety of the following summation: )
25 This is what I was just talking about.

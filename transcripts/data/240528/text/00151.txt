Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4606
1   some great lengths for the Defendant that year.
2            And Mr. Cohen -- that didn't come out on
3   cross-examination.
4            Mr. Cohen admitted that readily during direct
5   examination.
6            And it's true that he was the one -- that he was
7   never charged with that theft.
8            He's also the one who brought it to everyone's
9   attention.  He raised it.
10            He said, by the way, I didn't really get $50,000.
11   He volunteered it.
12            And what he did say was that after doing three
13   years or at least getting sentenced to three years, plus
14   three years of post release supervision, that he paid his
15   price for his role in this scheme.
16            But, in any event, none of this matters because
17   it's not a defense to the false business records charge that
18   one of the conspirators is also guilty of stealing from
19   another.
20            And, I will tell you something else that was kind
21   of funny.  I don't know if somebody caught this during
22   summation.  Mr. Blanche said, well, he stole $60,000, right,
23   because it was grossed up.
24            But -- so, that he means that the Defense is trying
25   to have it both ways, right.

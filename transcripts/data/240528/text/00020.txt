1       never going to be a Retainer Agreement.
2                Now, it was a big -- it was a big scam to cover up
3       a pay back.
4                Did they forget to tell Mr. Weisselberg about the
5       scam?
6                I mean, is that what Mr. Cohen wants you to
7       believe?
8                Absolutely not.
9                Now, the invoices continue to talk about Retainer
10       Agreements.
11                And, remember, Mr. Weisselberg was clear, he asked
12       for a Retainer Agreement, asked for him to see it.
13                You didn't see a Retainer Agreement.  There is no
14       evidence that there ever was one put together.
15                But, as you know, as you heard from multiple
16       witnesses about that, it doesn't matter.
17                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
18                THE COURT:  Sustained.
19                MR. BLANCHE:  As you know, the fact that there was
20       a verbal Retainer Agreement between Mr. Cohen and President
21       Trump is consistent with the practices of another lawyer you
22       heard from.
23                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
24                THE COURT:  Overruled.
25                MR. BLANCHE:  Mr. Davidson.  Keith Davidson.

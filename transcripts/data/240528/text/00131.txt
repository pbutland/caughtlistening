Proceedings

1            -- for someone who has been a Prosecutor as long as
2   you have, and a Defense Attorney as long as you have, you
3   know that making a comment like that is highly
4   inappropriate.
5            It's simply not allowed.  Period.
6            It's hard for me to imagine how that was accidental
7   in any way.
8            I will give a curative instruction.
9            I will ask the People to draft one up, and I will
10   give it.
11            See you at 2:00.
12            MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.

16            THE SERGEANT:  Remain seated.  Come to order.  The
17   Honorable Juan Merchan is presiding.
18            THE COURT:  People, do you have a draft of the
19   proposed instruction?
20            MS. HOFFINGER:  Yes, your Honor.  We do.
21            Judge, if I may just mention, not only was
22   Mr. Blanche's comment highly improper to a jury to suggest
23   that they not send the defendant to prison, but your Honor
24   specifically precluded any argument by the Defense about
25   potential punishment in your Honor's decision in response to

Summation/Mr. Blanche

1   of the case, the Government is going to have to prove that
2   there was a conspiracy.  Remember, not just a conspiracy to
3   promote a candidate.  That happens in every election.  There
4   has to be a conspiracy that involved unlawful means, so
5   something unlawful.
6            And I believe that the Government is going to talk
7   about three potential unlawful means that they will claim
8   makes this conspiracy a crime.
9            The first is the Federal Election Campaign Act,
10   FECA.
11            Now, you have to willfully -- I expect you will
12   learn that you have to willfully violate FECA.
13            There is no evidence, none, no evidence of a
14   willful violation of FECA.
15            Now, you are going to hear about the second
16   view that they have, which is the violation of the tax
17   laws.
18            Now, the evidence of this is from Mr. Cohen, who we
19   talked about a few -- a little bit ago.
20            He said that Mr. Weisselberg said:  We are going to
21   gross it up.
22            He had no idea what it meant, and neither did
23   Mr. McConney or Mr. Weisselberg, who supposedly said that to
24   him.
25            That's the tax fraud evidence.

Summation/Steinglass

1            THE COURT:  Overruled.
2            MR. STEINGLASS:  Ask yourselves: Does that make
3   any sense?
4            Are you kidding?  Because they're trying to close
5   some other deal, they're going to admit to campaign
6   finance violations?  Come on.
7            Critical here is Pecker's acknowledgment that he
8   never intended to publish the story under any
9   circumstances.
10            Remember that whole exchange we had with him. He
11   said that this would be like "National Enquirer gold".
12   Right? Somebody -- a Playboy Playmate of the Year claiming
13   to have a year-long sexual affair with a Presidential
14   candidate, but he never would have published it at any
15   time before or after the election.
16            Pecker was willing to sacrifice AMI's bottom line
17   in service of Mr. Trump's campaign.
18            There's just no way he can get around this
19   devastating fact.

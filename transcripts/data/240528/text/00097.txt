2   there is no surprise there.  It wasn't helpful.

5             But on October 8th when a recording was released,
6   Ms. Hicks said that she was concerned about the story being

17   got ready for the debate, responded to the allegations, and

21   but that happens all the time in campaigns, and we know
22   that.
23             I spent some time talking about that because the
24   Access Hollywood tape is being set up in this trial to be
25   something that it is not.  It was one of many stressful

4 MR. STEINGLASS: This deal was the very antithesis
5 of the normal legitimate press function.
6 AMI paid $150,000, or at least $125,000, for this
7 story, in coordination with the campaign. That is the very
8 definition of an unlawful corporate campaign contribution.
9 Remember, Pecker testified that at the time he
10 valued the content portion of the deal at $25,000, and the
11 life rights at $125,000, which is why that invoice from
12 IAS —— later on, we will get to that in a minute —— only
13 paid for $125,000. Not the whole $150,000.
14 AMI purchased the life rights for, and at the
15 request of the defendant, to help his candidacy.
16 Now, as the weeks go by, Pecker becomes
17 increasingly restless that the defendant hasn't paid him
18 back. And he testified that he spoke —— this is Pecker's
19 testimony, not just Cohen —— that he spoke with Cohen
20 several times about the fact that he was upset and that he
21 wanted to get his money back from the defendant.
22 And Cohen keeps telling him, "Don't worry, The
23 Boss will take care of it."
24 At the end of AMI's fiscal quarter, September 30th
25 is fast approaching, and Pecker wants to have the money

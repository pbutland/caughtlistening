Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4787
1 Rebecca Manochio you will remember testified that
2 Weisselberg and Trump interacted every day.
3 Tarsoff also said they spoke frequently, including
4 during the campaign and the transition period. She told
5 you that Weisselberg ran financial decisions by Mr. Trump
6 before carrying them out.
7 Weisselberg said during the meeting this would be
8 paid out like legal services rendered since Cohen was being
9 given the title of Personal Attorney to the President.
10 It was really a perfect solution. Cohen gets the
11 title he wants and Trump gets the way to disguise the
12 payment as income.
13 If you remember, Cohen said Weisselberg showed
14 this document, People's 35 to Trump.
15 And Weisselberg said in front of Mr. Trump, that
16 they would pay $35,0000 a month, and the actual payments
17 would start in February, not January, because there was too
18 much going on with the transition.
19 Mr. Cohen approved the arrangement and said, "This
20 is going to be a heck of a ride in D.C."
21 And make no mistake, in approving that
22 arrangement, the defendant caused a falsification of
23 business records in his own company.
24 On February 8th, 2017, you will recall Cohen went
25 to the White House to meet with President Trump.

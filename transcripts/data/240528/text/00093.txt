Summation - Defense/Blanche

1   happened, that Mr. Howard would have went to Los Angeles,
2   met with Ms. McDougal, asked her for corroboration, and
3   then said:  We are not going to buy this story.  We don't
4   think it's true?
5             So, what did happen?
6             What happened was, after that Access Hollywood
7   tape came out, Ms. Daniels and Ms. Rodriguez sees an
8   opportunity.  They came back to Mr. Howard again and said:
9   Okay, now; now is the time to strike.
10             And October 8, 2016, the day after the Access
11   Hollywood tape was released, Ms. Rodriguez reminded
12   Mr. Howard about Ms. Daniels.  She made claims about Fox
13   News, The Dirty.  None of that has been verified because
14   that's what it says on the text.
15             The election was about a month away at this
16   point.
17             And at this point, Dylan Howard, if you are going
18   to believe what you see on the text exchanges, believes
19   that there was enough leverage, based on the election, to
20   get AMI to get Mr. Pecker to pay Ms. Rodriguez and Ms.
21   Daniels.
22             See at the bottom, Mr. Howard says that Pecker
23   will likely pay, likely will pay.
24             And you know, by the way, that he was wrong,
25   right?

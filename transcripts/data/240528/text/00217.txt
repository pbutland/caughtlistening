Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1            (Whereupon, an audio recording was played in open
2   court.)
3            MR. STEINGLASS:  The defendant posted similar
4   comments on his Twitter account.
5            Here's a tweet from October 15th.
6            "Nothing ever happened with any of these women.
7   Totally made up nonsense to steal the election.  Nobody has
8   more respect for women than me."
9            And the next day, October 16th, "Polls close.  Can

11   on made-up events that never happened?  Media rigging
12   election."
13            And the day after that, "Can't believe these
14   totally phony stories.  One hundred percent made up by
15   women.  Many already proven false and pushed big time by
16   press.  Have impact."
17            Now, the defense wants you to think that the
18   Access Hollywood tape wasn't a big deal to the defendant.
19   It was just another blip.
20            And Ms. Necheles got Madeleine Westerhout to say
21   on cross-examination, "That everyone was freaking out
22   except for the defendant."  Please.
23            Ms. Westerhout admitted on redirect, she had zero,
24   zero firsthand knowledge about the defendant's reaction
25   because she didn't work for him at the time.  She was down

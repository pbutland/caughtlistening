1       Nothing sinister.
2                It was used because it was a quicker way to get
3       information to President Trump.
4                Again, not surprising when he was in the White
5       House.
6                Now, it wasn't even just President Trump that
7       received information that way.
8                Do you remember?
9                You also heard the First Lady got information from
10       Federal Express, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter got
11       it the same way.
12                So the fact that the checks and the personal
13       information was FedEx'd from Trump Tower to Keith Schiller
14       and then given to President Trump, there is nothing sinister
15       about that.
16                It's common sense when you hear the explanation of
17       why, which you heard from the witnesses.

1   accountants.
2            Later, based on these same false records and this
3   repayment scheme, The Trump Organization generated false
4   1099s.
5            These are the 1099s.
6            And they are false because they describe what is a
7   reimbursement as non-employee compensation.  Income.
8            And Mr. Blanche told you that they put these into

19   go to Michael Cohen, they went to the IRS.
20            Now, it's true that the result of this improper
21   accounting is that the taxes would have to be paid that
22   weren't owed; right?
23            You don't have to pay taxes on a reimbursement, so
24   then, you know, you don't have to report them as income.
25            So, the result of reporting them as income is the

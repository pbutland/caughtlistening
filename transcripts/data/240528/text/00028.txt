1 to go and get approval from Don and Eric, if it's already

4 expenses, it's actually just a payback from the $130,000
5 NDA, then why does this email exist? Then why do Don and
6 Eric have to approve anything?
7 So, you know, and I don't have an answer to why
8 this —— why the People, notwithstanding this email, tell you
9 that there is a conspiracy that exists.
10 But guess who else you did not hear from in this
11 trial? Don or Eric.
12 Is there some allegation that they are a part of
13 this scheme, that they are a part of the conspiracy?
14 Now, there is not even a tiny little bit of
15 evidence that suggests that, ladies and gentlemen.
16 That is reasonable doubt. We have no burden to do
17 anything.
18 The burden is always on the Government.
19 They make decisions about who to call at this
20 trial.
21 They called Cohen. They did not call Don and Eric.
22 So, remember what Mr. McConney told you after the first
23 couple of payments were made, after the first three payments
24 were made from The Trust, somebody realized, do you know
25 what, Mr. Cohen is the Personal Attorney to President Trump,

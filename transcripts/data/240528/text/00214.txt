Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4669
1            Chris Cuomo, then a CNN anchor, reached out to
2   Cohen to try to get him on the show to comment on the
3   Access Hollywood tape.  Cohen replied that he was in London
4   and he was scheduled to start news shows on Tuesday.
5            Remember, this is Saturday.  Cuomo tells Cohen,
6   "That is too late, Trump is dying right now."
7            And for what it is worth, Davidson and Howard also
8   seemed to recognize the import of the Access Hollywood
9   tape.
10            I am not going to read the words out loud, but
11   they kind of speak for themselves.  This was kind of the
12   perception after that Access Hollywood tape came out.
13            And on the evening of October 8th, there is a
14   flurry of activity among Hicks, Cohen, Pecker, Howard and
15   Mr. Trump.  So, you got the campaign staff and you have the
16   conspirators.
17            And, you don't have to remember all of these.  It
18   doesn't really matter.
19            The point is, the flurry of activity.  You have
20   Hicks calling Cohen, and Trump calling Cohen, and Hicks
21   calling Cohen, and Cohen calling Pecker, and Pecker calling
22   Howard, Howard calling Cohen.
23            And during these calls, Cohen tells Pecker about
24   an article on Radar Online about Mr. Trump being a Playboy
25   Man.

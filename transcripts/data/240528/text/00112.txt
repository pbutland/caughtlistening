Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 So, there are a lot of ways that you can judge the
2 credibility of a witness.
3 Judge Merchan is going to give you some for sure.
4 But, before you judge a witness, before you accept
5 what they're saying and evaluate it the way that you do in
6 everyday life, the reason why we have the jury system is,
7 the testimony is taken with an oath.
8 (Indicating.)
9 Right. It matters. You swear to tell the truth.
10 You swear that the words you are going to say to the jury
11 are truthful to the best of your recollection.
12 And, if there is anything that we've learned during
13 this trial, it is that Michael Cohen does not take that oath
14 seriously. Period.
15 He has repeatedly, repeatedly lied under oath. He
16 has lied to his family. He lied to his wife about the
17 $131,000 home equity line of credit. He said that he lied
18 to his kids about that as well. He lied to his banker. He
19 lied —— if you believe what he says about, at least what his
20 story on the stand was, he lied to the FEC. He lied to
21 every single reporter he talked to for about a year about
22 what happened.
23 I mean, he's literally like an MVP of liars. He
24 lies constantly.
25 He has lied to Congress. He lied to Prosecutors.

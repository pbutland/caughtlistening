10 That's what he said to you.
11 And Rhona Graff, right, you heard from Ms. Graff,
12 President Trump's longtime assistant testified a couple of
13 weeks ago that she was in and out of that meeting pretty
14 regularly and was part of that conversation.
15 We're going to listen to just a part of that
16 conversation now.

18 court.)
19 MR. BLANCHE: So, that's Rhona Graff.
20 She testified in this trial. Not a single
21 question was asked of her about that recording. No
22 questions about whether she remembered it. No questions
23 about if she remembered the context, the topic.

25 we've asked numerous witnesses about that. Cohen admitted

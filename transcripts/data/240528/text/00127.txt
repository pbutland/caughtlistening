Proceedings
4582
1 with the evidence you heard here in this courtroom, and
2 nothing else.
3 Nothing else that you knew or thought about
4 President Trump or about any of the other folks that
5 testified, but just the evidence that you heard from the
6 witnesses, the recordings and the documents.
7 If you do that, if you focus just on the evidence
8 you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very, very
9 quick and easy not guilty verdict.
10 Thank you.
11 THE COURT: Thank you.
12 Jurors, we are going to take our luncheon recess at
13 this time.
14 And I would like to start up again promptly at
15 2:00, all right.
16 Now, you heard only one of the summations, so,
17 please continue to follow all of my instructions.
18 Please do not talk, either among yourselves or with
19 anyone else, about anything related to the case.
20 Please continue to keep an open mind.
21 Don't form or express an opinion about the
22 defendant's guilt or innocence now that all of the evidence
23 is in.
24 You still haven't heard both summations, and I
25 still have to give you my final instructions on the law.

Senior Court Reporter

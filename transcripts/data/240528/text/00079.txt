Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 answered that call. And, again, would it have been a big
2 deal for him to say, I don't actually remember what
3 happened, it was a really a long time ago; I don't think
4 so. But he didnâ€˜t do that. He lied to me. He lied to me.
5 And, remember, this recording is being made,
6 supposedly, so that Mr. Cohen can go and play it to David
7 Pecker to calm him down. That's what he told you. But
8 then he just never played it. He never played it.
9 Apparently, it's the first time ever, and the only
10 time ever he records his client to kind of salvage what was
11 happening with him and Mr. Pecker, and then Mr. Pecker is
12 not asked about it, Mr. Cohen said, "I never played it for
13 him."
14 So, if anything, the McDougal story tells you a
15 lot, tells you a lot more about Mr. Cohen.
16 So, the last story we're going to talk about is a
17 story involving Stormy Daniels. This is an event that
18 supposedly happened in 2006, 18 years ago. President Trump
19 and Ms. Daniels have repeatedly denied it took place.
20 However, the story was published in 2011. Again,
21 long before 2016, long before the August 2015 meeting at
22 Trump Tower. So, how could this issue have influenced the
23 election? People already knew about the allegations. It
24 was already a published story. So, what really happened
25 here? And I think you saw this from the testimony. Is

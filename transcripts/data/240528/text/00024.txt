Summation/Mr. Blanche

1                Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not include a
2       passage in a book from decades earlier, ladies and
3       gentlemen.
4                So, you heard also from Ms. Tarasoff about how she
5       decided how to put information in the vouchers.
6                And she told you, remember, this is an email that
7       was sent on Valentine's Day 2017 where Mr. McConney told
8       Deb:  "Pay this from The Trust, post to legal expenses and
9       put retainer on the months of January and February, 2017."
10       Very clear instructions.  And it's exactly what Ms. Tarasoff

19       on the voucher -- that what Ms. Tarasoff was told to do is
20       exactly what she did; she followed Mr. McConney's
21       instructions.
22                She didn't follow President Trump's instructions.
23       She didn't follow Allen Weisselberg's instructions.  She
24       followed Mr. McConney's instructions.
25                Now, she booked it as a legal expense, which, by

Summation/Mr. Blanche
4574
1 There is no evidence that there was anything
2 improper about the way that these taxes were handled by
3 President Trump, by The Trump Organization, or by Michael
4 Cohen. None.
5 And the last one is the falsifying of business
6 records.
7 Now, the bottom line is, as we talked about at
8 length, there is no falsification of business records.
9 Period. And any argument to the contrary by the People is
10 wrong.
11 I expect they are going to talk to you about other
12 documents besides the counts that President Trump is
13 charged with, like the LLCs that Mr. Cohen created along the
14 way; bank records with Mr. Davidson; but there is no
15 evidence at all, not even a little bit of evidence that
16 President Trump knew anything about any of those false
17 filings. None.
18 Remember that invoice from Investor Advisor
19 Services that was sent from AMI to Mr. Cohen for the
20 $150,000 payment?
21 It's People's Exhibit 103.
22 Even Mr. Pecker said he hadn't seen that until the
23 investigation started.
24 Again, no evidence President Trump had anything to
25 do with that.

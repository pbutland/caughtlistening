4                There were outstanding matters that Mr. Cohen was
5       dealing with on behalf of President Trump in 2017.
6                Here is just one example, and there are others.
7       This is a May 2017 email from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Weisselberg:
8       "Hope all is well.  Please find attached the May invoice.
9       And call me to discuss the last open foundation matter."

21                Here is another example.
22                There was some litigation related matter, as you
23       may recall, from someone named Summer Zervos.
24                Now -- and, again, this happened a lot.  But Cohen

Summation/Steinglass
4625
1 secretary, especially your female press secretary.
2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.
3 THE COURT: Overruled.
4 MR. STEINGLASS: As Hicks told you in her own
5 words, there were some things she just didnâ€˜t want to
6 know.
7 As Mr. Pecker explained, the meeting began with
8 Donald Trump and Michael Cohen asking what Pecker could do
9 to help the campaign.
10 And you can have his testimony read back, any
11 part of it, all of it, his description of this meeting.
12 He gave you a lot more detail about this meeting
13 than Michael Cohen did, actually.
14 During this Trump Tower meeting, they settled on
15 three key components of the meeting:
16 Number one. To accentuate the positive. To
17 promote the campaign, but not by endorsing Mr. Trump or
18 by printing puff pieces. By colluding directly with the
19 campaign to manufacture favorable content.
20 Far outside any of the normal, legitimate press
21 function.
22 Pecker and Howard actually sent articles to the
23 campaign in advance so that Cohen could show them to
24 Mr. Trump, and he could exercise veto power over certain
25 topics or make certain changes in advance.

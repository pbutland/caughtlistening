1 the August 2015 meeting.
2 Mr. Pecker told you that.
3 Mr. Cohen didn't dispute that.
4 There were no financial arrangements discussed at
5 that meeting.
6 Think about that.
7 The Government wants to you believe that the
8 three stories we‘re going to talk about —— Ms. McDougal,
9 Ms. Daniels, and Dino Sajudin —— were the essence of
10 the catch and kill scheme between Mr. Cohen, AMI and
11 Mr. Trump. And it wasn't even discussed at the time the
12 conspiracy was formed. No financial discussion. No
13 discussion about catch and kill.
14 Think about that.
15 So, Mr. Pecker told you about the first time that
16 he heard "catch and kill", and he said it was from the
17 investigation.
18 And then, on redirect, he was asked whether he
19 actually read it in an article.
20 And he said, yes, he read it in an article
21 earlier, but make no mistake about it, there was no catch
22 and kill discussed at this August 2015 meeting when this
23 supposed conspiracy was born.
24 So, let‘s talk for a few minutes about the catch
25 and kill scheme.

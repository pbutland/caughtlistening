Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4614
1 call, the part that this transcript pertains to, that took
2 46 seconds.
3 In that conversation, they talked about their
4 friend David; how Cohen had talked to Weisselberg about how
5 to set it all up; about their concern that Pecker might get
6 hit by a truck; about different ways to reimburse Pecker;
7 the amount of the reimbursement.
8 These guys know each other well. They speak in
9 coded language.
10 And they speak fast.

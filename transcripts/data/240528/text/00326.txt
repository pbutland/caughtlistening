Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4781
1 when every single conversation took place? But what is
2 clear is that Cohen is trying to reach Mr. Trump
3 immediately after he learns that the Stormy Daniels deal is
4 off.
5 On October 26th, Cohen initiated the wire transfer
6 from the Essential Consultants account to Davidson's
7 account. That's on October 26th. And he explained that
8 Mr. Trump —— that he called Mr. Trump before doing so.
9 Again, the phone records corroborate this. The
10 morning of October 26th at 8:26 a.m., and again at 8:34,
11 Cohen spoke to Mr. Trump.
12 Just stop for a minute to think of the timing of
13 these phone calls. They're absolutely critical.
14 Unlike the call on the 24th, this was the final go
15 ahead.
16 Cohen explained that he was seeking, and he got,
17 final authorization to make the payment. And that
18 explanation makes sense because Cohen wasn't going to
19 layout $130,000 without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump.
20 Here's from the transcript:
21 "QUESTION: Did you call Mr. Trump before you went
22 and set up the account to make a transfer?
23 "ANSWER: Yes .
24 "QUESTION: What, in substance, did you discuss
25 with him on these two calls?

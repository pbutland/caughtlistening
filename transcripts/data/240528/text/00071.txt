Summation/Mr. Blanche

1   recording.  A lot.  The Government has not shown you that
2   that evidence is reliable, and I am going to talk about
3   why.
4            Let's start with the context.
5            Now, Mr. Cohen told you that the reason why he had
6   to tape this conversation with his client was so that he
7   could play it to David Pecker.  He was going to record his
8   client, President Trump, and then play that back to Mr.
9   Pecker, so that Mr. Pecker could be assured that money was
10   coming.  He wanted to reassure Mr. Pecker about President
11   Trump's intentions.
12            Now, he never did that.  Right?  He told you he
13   never actually played the recording for Mr. Pecker.
14            That was just his reason for doing it.  You could
15   see that what happened, according to Mr. Cohen, is that
16   there was another conversation that happened the day after,
17   and then there was no reason because of that to play this
18   recording to Mr. Pecker.
19            But, remember, keep in mind the testimony about
20   the lunch.  Okay.  When Pecker was, supposedly, still very
21   angry, still angry about not getting paid back the money,
22   and Cohen said that that happened in September of 2016 --
23   Labor Day, ladies and gentlemen, was September 5th, so the
24   weekend before Labor Day, obviously, was the 4th and the
25   3rd, which leaves just two days, just two days in September

1   going to talk about in a minute, to President Trump for
2   President Trump to look at. So, he wants to you believe
3   that President Trump saw this piece of paper where there's
4   130,000; 50,000 for Red Finch -- which you know from
5   testimony President Trump said, "I'm not paying that."
6            But, out of the blue, he decides: You know what,
7   not only am I gonna pay it, let's double it. Let's double
8   it. Oh, you didn't like your bonus. You didn't think 50
9   was enough. Let's throw in another 60.
10            That's what Mr. Cohen wants you to believe
11   happened in that meeting when Mr. Weisselberg walked in
12   with that piece of paper and, supposedly, showed it to
13   President Trump.
14            That is absurd.
15            All the other evidence, you heard about how
16   carefully President Trump watches his finances.

18   Organization, remember, was to make sure every bill that's

20            Now, by the way, his version of events with the
21   campaign are belied by other evidence.
22            He told you he deserved the extra bonus than the
23   normal bonus he normally gets because of all the work on
24   the campaign.
25            What did Ms. Hicks tell you about Mr. Cohen's

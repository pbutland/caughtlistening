Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 The Trust shouldn't be paying that, President Trump should
2 be paying that out of his own personal account. And that's
3 what they did.
4 They recognized that, as they settled in, that
5 because it was a Personal Attorney to the President, that it
6 didn't make sense for the Trump Organization, for The Trust
7 to pay it.
8 They made a mistake the first three months and they
9 fixed it.
10 And, again, that's not evidence of some scheme or
11 intent to defraud, that's just what happens. And it
12 shouldn't surprise you.
13 And so, we can talk about the checks as well while
14 we are on it.
15 Now, there are 11 checks, right, because the first
16 check was for 70 —— was for two months, was for $70,000.
17 Exhibit 4, which is what you see on the screen, it's a
18 $70,000 check relating to the months of January and
19 February, and the second one, People's Exhibit 7, is a
20 $35,000 check relating to March.
21 You know that both of these checks were approved by
22 Eric and Don Jr.
23 And President Trump had nothing to do with them.
24 There is no evidence he had anything to do with anything
25 involving either of these checks.

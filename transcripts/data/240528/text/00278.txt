Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1   information to determine what the check was for and decide
2   whether or not to sign it.
3            And I know what you're thinking, is this guy going
4   to go through every single months's worth of checks?  The
5   answer is no.
6            We are just going to do one more, because this is
7   from The Trust, and we are going to do one from the time
8   that Mr. Trump was paying it on his own.
9            So, we will go through, if you look here, we will
10   use December.
11            On December 1st, at 9:11 a.m., Cohen sends the
12   December invoice to Weisselberg.  Care of Donald Trump.  He
13   can't email Mr. Trump himself because Mr. Trump refuses to
14   use email.
15            As Cohen testified, during certain conversations,
16   Mr. Trump would comment that, quote, he knows too many
17   people who have gone down as a direct result of having
18   emails that prosecutors can use in a case.
19            MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, objection.
20            THE COURT:  Overruled.
21            MR. STEINGLASS:  That was the testimony directly on
22   Page 3276.
23            And it fits; right?  You haven't seen a single
24   email.
25            Mr. Trump does not use email, famously.  Why?

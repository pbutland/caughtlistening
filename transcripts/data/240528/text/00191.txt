2 And he knew, and he testified that he knew that

7 and Davidson.
8 Cohen and Pecker continued to speak, just as they
9 both told you, by phone and by text.
10 Here's a 20—minute call on July 7th.
11 But, as Davidson told you —— and this part just
12 kind of got left out of the Defense summation because it
13 doesn't really jive with their whole claim that this Karen
14 McDougal thing wasn't a real catch and kill because she
15 didn't want her story to go public.
16 The problem is, that's not what was happening,
17 because, as Davidson told you, he was also simultaneously
18 shopping the story to ABC News.
19 Remember, they were considering a deal where she
20 would get a shot on Dancing With the Stars. That deal
21 would have required her to go public.
22 Now, it's true that Karen McDougal preferred the
23 AMI deal because she thought it would revive her career,
24 and she wouldn't have to be the next Monica Lewinsky.
25 But, her motivations were totally irrelevant.

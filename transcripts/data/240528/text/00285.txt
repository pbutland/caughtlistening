Summation/Steinglass

1 Her testimony was corroborated by Rebecca
2 Manochio at The Trump Organization, who said that after
3 the Defendant went to the White House, he would hold on to
4 individual checks if he had questions about them. That was
5 her testimony.
6 On February 21, 2017, the Defendant was
7 consulting on whether to suspend a golf membership at a
8 particular golf club that will cost him less than $7,000
9 for the whole year. He asks Ms. Graff to pay it ASAP. He
10 okays it with his initials.
11 Now, if after Mr. Trump became President, he
12 didn't have time to review his own invoices and checks, he
13 could have changed the procedures so that he's not the
14 only signatory, the way he did with the entities he put
15 into The Trust. He could have allowed Weisselberg or Eric
16 or Don Junior to sign the checks from the DJT entity, or
17 he could have let his wife sign the checks, or used
18 AutoPay to pay some of the utilities.
19 Why set up these systems to bypass the White
20 House security protocols? Why, literally, send checks to
21 his employees' homes so he could sneak them into the White
22 House undetected? Why have the invoices go from Cohen, to
23 Weisselberg, to McConney, to Tarasoff, to have her stamp
24 them, and have her attach the invoices to the check stubs,
25 and then have them go to Tarasoff, to Manochio, to

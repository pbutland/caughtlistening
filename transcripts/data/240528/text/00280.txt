Summation/Mr. Steinglass

9 You can —— on some of these you can —— I know these
10 things have been Xeroxed a bunch of times, but you can
11 actually still kind of see the staple marks on some of
12 these.
13 Now, it's easy to just throw a bunch of mud on the
14 wall and see what sticks, but what is the Defense actually
15 saying here?
16 Let's just consider it logically.
17 Trump didn't know about the reimbursement? It was
18 all cooked up by Weisselberg and Cohen? That's crazy.
19 Neither one of them had anywhere near that kind of
20 authority.
21 Even Weisselberg, the CFO, could only approve
22 invoices up to $10,000 and no one could sign the Donald
23 Trump checks besides Donald Trump.
24 But let's just assume for one —— let's play this
25 out.

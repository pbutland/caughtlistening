1   Rodriguez.  He added the extra $10,000 as his own fee for
2   papering the deal.
3            This is part of the reason that that extortion
4   narrative is so clearly bogus.  Because neither Daniels nor
5   Rodriguez ever reached out to Trump, nor to Cohen, to try
6   to sell them the story so it won't be published.  They
7   were brokering the deal of the story to AMI, where, at
8   least Rodriguez and Daniels thought it would be
9   published.
10            But, as both Pecker and Davidson told you, AMI
11   decided they didn't want to buy another story.  Not after
12   spending $30,000 on Sajudin and $130,000 on McDougal.
13            By then Pecker knew there was not any legitimate
14   way to structure a deal so that he could get reimbursed by
15   Trump.  So he says, "I will take a pass."
16            And Howard learns that Pecker won't pay a few
17   minutes later.
18            He tells Pecker, "The woman wants $120,000.  This
19   story is true.  I can buy it."
20            But, Pecker walks.
21            As he told you, he wasn't a bank.
22            Howard acknowledges that, and he says, "Okay, if
23   you don't want to buy it, we should call Cohen, so Cohen
24   could handle it directly on Trump's behalf, rather than
25   going through AMI."

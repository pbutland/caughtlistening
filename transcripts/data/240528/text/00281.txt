Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4736
1 This is the Defense argument. Let's play it out.
2 Weisselberg and Cohen approve this reimbursement scheme all
3 on their own.
4 So, now it's April, whatever, and Mr. Trump gets
5 his small stack of checks and invoices and he's flipping
6 through and he's paying his 80 dollar Verizon bill and he
7 comes to a $35,000 check to Michael Cohen, the Personal
8 Attorney to the President, the guy who is basically doing no
9 work at all for Mr. Trump.
10 And there is no one else he works for, right, he's
11 the Personal Attorney to the President.
12 So whatever work he's doing, he's doing for the
13 President.
14 So then what? This guy is doing no work. What
15 does Mr. Trump do at that moment, when he suddenly realizes
16 we're paying this guy $35,000?
17 Does he pick up the phone and call Allen
18 Weisselberg?
19 Does he call Cohen and say why am I paying you
20 $35,000 for nothing? No. He just signs it. Every month.
21 And he never once picks up that phone. He never once make
22 further inquiry.
23 I mean, the December invoice that I just showed you
24 is for services rendered in the month of December and it
25 says on December 1st, at 9:11 a.m.

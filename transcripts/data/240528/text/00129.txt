1 once again, as they did with the testimony, that it‘s
2 perfectly plausible to not have a Retainer Agreement, when
3 that is not the law in New York State.
4 For all of the reasons we argued earlier, but also
5 for the new reason that they have now doubled down on it
6 and, again, misled the jury, I think your Honor should
7 reconsider your decision and give the curative instruction
8 that we provided.
9 Thank you.
10 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, the law that was
11 presented to the Court has to do with payment, not with
12 whether a Retainer Agreement can be oral.
13 Indeed, the cases cited, one of the main cases
14 cited was a State that was suing to not have to pay the full
15 amount to a lawyer, and the issue was whether or not there
16 was an attorney—client privilege rather than whether or not
17 the retainer was valid. That was not the issue.
18 More significantly, 100—years—plus of legal
19 experience testified, and there wasn't a single question
20 other than on cross—examination about the —— when they
21 testified about it on cross that: Hey, retainer agreements
22 can be oral, they don't have to be in writing; and then the
23 same for Mr. Costello when he testified on direct.
24 But there wasn't a single question on cross by the
25 People questioning him about that.

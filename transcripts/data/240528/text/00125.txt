Summation/Mr. Blanche
4580
1   guys heard of a GOAT; like the GOAT, the Greatest Of All
2   Time?
3            It's like what people talk about with athletes
4   like Michael Jordan as the GOAT; Tiger Woods as the GOAT;
5   Tom Brady as the GOAT.  These athletes are the "Greatest of
6   All Time," the best among their peers.
7            Michael Cohen is the GLOAT.  He's, literally, the
8   Greatest Liar of All Time!
9            He has lied to every single branch of Congress,
10   both Houses, the House and the Senate.
11            He has lied to the Department of Justice when he
12   met with the Special Counsel's Office.
13            He has lied to Federal Judges on multiple
14   occasions.
15            He has lied to State Judges.
16            He has lied to his family.
17            He has lied to his bankers.
18            He has lied to the people he works with.
19            He stole from President Trump.
20            His words cannot be trusted.
21            And I'm going to end this summation the same way,
22   the same way that I told you a few minutes ago that you know
23   you cannot rely on him, which is that all those lies, lies
24   under oath, lies to his family, lies when it matters, lies
25   when it doesn't matter, all those lies, put them to the side

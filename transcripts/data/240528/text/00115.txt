Summation/Mr. Blanche
4570
1            (Displayed.)
2            MR. BLANCHE:  He sells merchandise that shows
3   President Trump in an orange jumpsuit, behind bars.
4            He has followed this investigation the entire
5   time.
6            He followed the case after indictment.  He told you
7   that.
8            He talked about the case repeatedly on his podcast
9   and on social media.
10            And he also, as I said a few minutes ago, followed
11   what happened in this trial before he testified.
12            He admitted that he heard about Mr. Pecker's
13   testimony.
14            Think about that for a minute.  A witness who
15   outright hates the defendant, admittedly hates the
16   defendant, he wants him in jail, is actively making money
17   off of his hatred.
18            That witness pays attention to what other witnesses
19   are telling you in this courtroom before he testifies.
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
21            THE COURT:  Sustained.
22            MR. BLANCHE:  Now, Michael Cohen tells you that he
23   has lied for Donald Trump.
24            He has told you that he has lied to protect his
25   family, and for other reasons.

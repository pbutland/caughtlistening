Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1            I don't know, I don't want to belabor this, but
2   think about for a minute about what you have to accept in
3   order to buy this Defense argument.
4            You have to think that both Pecker and Davidson
5   were lying when they testified under oath that Cohen told
6   them in 2016 that he expected to get paid back.
7            You have to think that McConney was lying when he

12   exactly how the Stormy Daniels payment was converted into a
13   $420,000 repayment amount.
14            You would have to disregard the fact that all of
15   the checks and accounting records showing that $420,000 just
16   so happened to be the exact amount that Cohen was paid in
17   2017.
18            You would have to disregard the fact that Cohen
19   wasn't paid a dime in 2018, even though everyone agrees he
20   was doing legal work that year as well.
21            And you would have to disregard the defendant's
22   repeated admissions that he knew the payments were a
23   reimbursement.
24            You would have to think that despite this mountain
25   of evidence, none of that actually happened, and Cohen was

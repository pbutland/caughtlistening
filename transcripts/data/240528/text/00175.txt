1            That doesn't mean the line wasn't also crossed
2   here.
3            The Arnold Schwarzenegger conduct kicked off an
4   investigation into Federal Election Finance Laws --
5   finance issues.
6            You know what?  You may say -- a lot of people
7   say this: Who cares? Who cares if Mr. Trump slept with a
8   porn star ten years before the 2016 election?
9            Plenty of people feel that way, as I said.
10            But, it's harder to say that the American people
11   don't have the right to decide for themselves whether they
12   care or not, that a handful of people sitting in a room
13   can decide what information gets into those voters' hands.
14            Even if the first two aspects of the Trump Tower
15   deal, the positive stories about Trump and the negative
16   stories about his opponents, even if those were a much
17   seedier version of politics as usual, the catch and kill
18   piece was not. Because, as I said, once AMI purchased
19   stories on a candidate's behalf and in coordination with
20   that campaign, those purchases became unlawful campaign
21   contributions.
22            I suggest to you that the value of this corrupt
23   bargain forged at this Trump Tower meeting cannot be
24   overstated. It turned out to be one of the most valuable
25   contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign.

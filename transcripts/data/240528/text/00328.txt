Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 he didn't know, after the Wall Street Journal article came
2 out in January of 2018, he said, "Isn't it nice that Cohen
3 did this out of the kindness of his heart?" She didn't buy
4 it for one minute. She said, that would be out of
5 character for Michael. He wasn't an especially charitable
6 or selfless person.
7 Half an hour after that second call with Trump,
8 Cohen initials the process. He gets the incorporation
9 paperwork from Patty at Delaney at 9:04 a.m.
10 And the timing of these phone calls is just simply
11 too coincidental for Cohen's description of the call to be
12 anything other than accurate.
13 And Cohen's explanation makes sense because it's
14 consistent with both Trump's management style and with
15 Cohen's own persona.
16 On October 28th, Cohen receives the signed NDA and
17 SLA, and those documents establish that David Dennison is
18 Mr. Trump. Cohen let Trump know immediately. He had every
19 incentive to.
20 Again, you see a five minute plus call with him
21 that morning. Cohen testified that he told Donald Trump
22 the matter was completely under control and locked down
23 pursuant to the NDA. And that also rings true; right.
24 Because if Cohen accomplished something for Mr. Trump, he
25 wanted Mr. Trump to know immediately.

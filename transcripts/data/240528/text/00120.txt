Summation/Mr. Blanche
4575
1            There is also number five.  There is no evidence of
2   any illegal effort to influence the 2016 election.
3            And I just went through all that.  I'm not going to
4   go through it again.
5            But, just remember, for you to believe this
6   happened, you have to believe that at this August 2015
7   meeting, there was a conspiracy formed, an illegal
8   conspiracy to criminally influence the election.
9            MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
10            THE COURT:  Sustained.
11            MR. BLANCHE:  Now, Mr. Weisselberg was not at that
12   meeting.  You know that.  Nobody suggested otherwise.
13            There is no evidence that he ever talked to anyone
14   about trying to promote President Trump's campaign.
15            So, again, even if you do believe that
16   Mr. Weisselberg had something to do with the payments that
17   are ultimately at issue in this case, there is no evidence
18   he had anything to do with whatever agreement was reached to
19   try to influence the election.
20            Another reason there is reasonable doubt.
21            AMI would have run -- would have run Mr. Sajudin's
22   story no matter what.  That's not catch-and-kill.
23            Another reason.
24            McDougal did not want her story published. She
25   wanted to be on the covers of magazines.  And guess what?

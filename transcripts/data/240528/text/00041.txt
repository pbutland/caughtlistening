1   Mr. Cohen had visited the White House on February 8th --
2   Mr. Cohen sends an email back to Mr. McConney, asking:
3   "Hey. How much does the monthly retainer run again? What
4   am I supposed to do?"
5            This is after Mr. McConney emailed him and said:
6   "Hey. Send us an invoice if you want to get paid. Jeff."
7            "Please remind me of the monthly amount?"
8            So, Mr. Cohen wants you to believe February 8th
9   he was in the Oval Office for the first time after
10   Mr. Trump became President of the United States, they have
11   a confirmatory Agreement about the scheme and why you're
12   here, but just six days later, Cohen doesn't even know how
13   much it's supposed to be.
14            So, the last thing I want to say about the notes
15   that we were looking at earlier about Mr. Weisselberg is
16   -- the notes that you now see next to the -- next to the
17   notes, which are the notes that Mr. McConney told you he
18   took after a separate conversation with Mr. Weisselberg.
19            First of all, Mr. McConney's notes don't reflect
20   180,000. They don't say what it's for.
21            It just has it written. It says "times two".
22            It also suggests that the money is going to come
23   out of President Trump's personal account, which, as you
24   recall, for the first three months it didn't. There was
25   confusion.

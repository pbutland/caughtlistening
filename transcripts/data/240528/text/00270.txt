Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4725
1 Mr. Blanche said, well, he signed —— well, he
2 signed every email, it wasn't a secret.
3 We are not saying it was a secret. He used that
4 title to get himself his consulting clients for which he was
5 paid $4 million.
6 He was making way more money than any Government
7 job would ever pay.
8 And don't I know that.
9 He could afford to throw in a couple of extra hours
10 of work over the course of the next year without sending a
11 bill. He's not working for free. It's called good will.
12 And don't buy the Defense argument that the hourly —— he
13 wanted to keep —— when I say "good will," he wanted to keep
14 Mr. Trump happy; right, so that he could keep the title
15 Personal Attorney to the President and keep monetizing it to
16 the tune of $4 million.
17 That's not working for free. And don't buy —— the
18 Defense tried to argue that the hourly rate Cohen was
19 getting from his consulting clients was equally inflated.
20 He wasn't being paid an hourly rate to be a
21 consultant, he was being paid to provide access to
22 Mr. Trump. That's how it works.
23 At the time, President Trump was a Washington
24 outsider.
25 And Cohen was in a perfect position to monetize

Proceedings
4457
1 evening.
2 I asked that you please get back to me if there
3 were any errors that you observed in there.
4 I didn’t hear from either one of you.
5 I did make clear that you shouldn’t get back to me
6 if you disagreed with the charges; you already made all of
7 your arguments and I considered the arguments; and that was
8 my final decision.
9 Before we get started, let’s get an update.
10 Mr. Blanche, how long do you expect your summation
11 to be?
12 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I believe around two and
13 a half hours, maybe a little under that.
14 THE COURT: All right.
15 And, People?
16 MR. STEINGLASS: Obviously, it will have to be
17 somewhat responsive to counsel’s summation, but I would
18 estimate somewhere in the vicinity of four, four and a half
19 hours, as I had previously suggested.
20 THE COURT: All right. So that means that we may
21 or may not finish yours by 4:30.
22 What I’m going to do is ask the jurors if they are
23 willing to work beyond 4:30 so that we can finish your
24 summation today.
25 I’m going to leave it up to them, and if they say

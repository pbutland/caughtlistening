1            It's not surprising Cohen would be reaching out
2   as soon as he learned about this Karen McDougal story,
3   because he would be -- as he told you, he would be risking
4   his job by not keeping The Boss informed about
5   developments like this.
6            So, within a minimum of this, "Where's The
7   Boss?", "Next to me", the Defendant called Cohen for an
8   update.
9            Then, on June 20th, Howard is texting Cohen from
10   the plane. He calls Cohen when he lands. Even before he

12   exactly who Cohen is representing, and he wants to keep
13   Cohen in the loop.
14            So, this meeting on June 20th with Karen McDougal

22            Cohen was also texting Howard directly.
23            Howard was giving real-time texts, but Cohen
24   wanted to speak on the phone.  "Could he be reached out
25   to?"

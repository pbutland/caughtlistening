Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4604
1 And he is still here, providing information about
2 what went down.
3 And, also, if you remember that recorded
4 conversation between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson that was
5 admitted into evidence through Davidson, that's People's
6 Exhibit 265 —— this is just the transcript of that call ——
7 Cohen reveals that the Defendant tells him that he hates the
8 fact that he did it, referring to the Daniels story.
9 In other words, Mr. Cohen is saying that Mr. Trump
10 hates the fact that we did it.
11 And this is before his cooperation, before he had
12 any conceivable motive to lie, before his guilty plea.
13 I mean, he was still getting monthly checks at this
14 point.
15 And something else about this phone call that was
16 very interesting.
17 Mr. Blanche —— it sounded like he admitted it ——
18 that at least as early as 2017, the Defendant knew of the
19 Stormy Daniels payments.
20 And, remember, 2017 is when the checks were still
21 rolling in every month.
22 Of course, the Defendant knew much earlier than
23 2017.
24 And we will get to why in a moment, but I just
25 wanted to point that out to you.

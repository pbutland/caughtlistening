Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4603
1 he dropped him like a hot potato and tweeted out to the
2 world that Mr. Cohen was a scumbag —— a "SleazeBag", I
3 think, is the word that he used.
4 And, all the while, the Election Law Violations to
5 which Cohen pled guilty were committed at the Defendant's
6 direction and for his benefit.
7 MR. BLANCHE: Objection. Objection, your Honor.
8 THE COURT: Overruled.
9 MR. STEINGLASS: Anyone in Cohen's shoes would want
10 the Defendant to be held accountable.
11 So, the Defense urges you to reject Cohen's
12 testimony because he was seeking a benefit when he spoke to
13 members of our Office way back when.
14 And, by the way, what Cohen testified to was that
15 he spent hours in the Office, speaking to people in the
16 Office, he told you however many times he met with the
17 people in the Office, he testified that he did not and he
18 has not met with District Attorney Bragg.
19 What he said was —— what the Defense is saying is
20 that, well, he asked us about giving him a letter in support
21 of his many motions to try to get his sentence reduced or
22 his supervised release reduced.
23 And it's true, he did ask about that. But guess
24 what? He never got one. And he never got his sentence
25 reduced either.

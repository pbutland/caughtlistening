Summation — Defense/Blanche
4559
1 In that environment, when Mr. Cohen was under all
2 of that stress, facing the biggest crisis of his life, he
3 said to Mr. Costello, President Trump did not know.
4 So, briefly, on Mr. Costello, it's just another
5 example of Mr. Cohen taking the witness stand and lying to
6 you.
7 He told you that he never engaged Mr. Costello
8 and didn't consider Mr. Costello his attorney.
9 He told you that Mr. Costello seemed sketchy and
10 that he didn't trust him.
11 He told you that Mr. Costello brought a Retainer
12 Agreement to that April 17th meeting.
13 You know that that's not true. There was no
14 Engagement Letter until at least three or four days later.
15 And he told you he spoke to Mr. Costello around
16 10 times.
17 You know it was over 70.
18 Each of those things he said to you about what
19 happened between him and Mr. Costello was a lie.
20 And I don't know how many lies are enough lies to
21 just reject Mr. Cohen's testimony, big or small, meaningful
22 or unmeaningful, but that was a lie.
23 You know that there was an attorney—client
24 relationship between Bob Costello and Michael Cohen, there
25 is no doubt about that, and so does Mr. Cohen.

1            "Answer:  Correct."
2            "Question:  On whose direction -- on whose behalf
3   did you work with AMI to do that?"
4            "Answer:  I worked with Dylan Howard, I worked
5   with David Pecker, and also Dan Rotstein."
6            "Question:  At whose direction and whose behalf
7   did you do that?"
8            "Answer:  At the direction of Donald J. Trump."
9            "Question:  And for whose benefit?"
10            "Answer: For the benefit of Donald J. Trump."
11            These guilty pleas on August 21, 2018, those are
12   the turning point. That was the moment Mr. Cohen finally
13   came clean about what he had done with Donald Trump and
14   why.
15            The Defendant was furious. His fixer had done the
16   unthinkable.
17            And Trump immediately went on the attack, an
18   attack that continues to this day.
19            The very next morning after Cohen pled guilty --
20   and the plea was widely reported -- the Defendant took to
21   Twitter again.
22            "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would
23   strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of
24   Michael Cohen."
25            This is the day after he pled guilty.

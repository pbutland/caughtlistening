Summation/Blanche
4519
1 Remember, Davidson took 45 percent of the $150,000. You
2 also heard about a bodyguard. That was Johnny Crawford,
3 who was a police officer, who was providing security. All
4 of them would be compensated. And you also heard about her
5 manager, Gene Rodriguez, who was also compensated. All
6 these people around Ms. McDougal wanted to make money. Of
7 course.
8 So, whatever she ended up with from 150,000 was
9 not much and, again, did not seem to bother her because
10 that was not her motive.
11 She wanted to be on the cover of magazines. She
12 wanted to write articles.
13 She was not trying to get her story published and
14 then have it caught and killed.
15 So —— let‘s talk about what happened —— again,
16 the legality of the situation. Okay.
17 So, you have the Government's argument that what
18 happened here was, somehow, important. Okay. There was
19 something wrong about to happen.
20 That's not what Mr. Pecker talked about and not
21 what he told you.
22 Remember, he told you that he consulted with an
23 attorney.
24 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
25 THE COURT: Sustained.

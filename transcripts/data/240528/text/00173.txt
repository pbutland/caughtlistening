1   you investigate it.

5            In his opening, Mr. Blanche said, and I quote:
6   "There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an
7   election. It's called democracy."

10            Democracy gives the people the right to elect
11   their leaders, but that rests on the fundamental premise
12   that the voters have access to accurate information about
13   the candidates.
14            The entire purpose of this meeting at Trump Tower
15   was to deny that access, to manipulate and defraud the
16   voters, to pull the wool over their eyes in a coordinated
17   fashion.

19   press activities the moment they agreed to become a covert
20   arm of the Defendant's campaign.
21            Now, similarly, the Defense has pointed out again
22   and again that NDAs aren't illegal in and of themselves.
23            That's true.
24            That's totally besides the point.

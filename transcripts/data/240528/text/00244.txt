1   Pecker the next day that the story only caused one day of
2   discomfort and back to the campaign issues.
3             And that was a good thing for the Defendant
4   because the election was only three days away.
5             Now, Hicks explained, frankly, that Mr. Trump was
6   concerned about the effects of the article both on his wife
7   and on the campaign.
8             This is from her testimony:
9             Question:  And after it was published on
10   November 5th, did you discuss the article with Mr. Trump?
11             Answer:  I did.
12             Question:  What, if anything, did you discuss?
13             Answer:  Um, he was concerned about the story.
14   Um, he was concerned how it would be viewed by his wife,
15   um, and he wanted to make sure that the newspapers weren't
16   delivered to their residence that morning.
17             Question:  Did he also ask you whether it was --
18   whether you thought it was likely to affect the campaign?
19             Answer:  Um, everything we talked about in the
20   context of, you know, this time period, in this time
21   period, was about whether or not there was an impact on the
22   campaign.
23             So, certainly, I don't recall specifically him
24   saying that, but everything was -- something that Mr. Trump
25   said a lot is, how -- how is it playing?

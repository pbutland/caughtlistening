Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 this was done.
2 Remember —— and the transcript is on the screen
3 now —— the purpose was basically to make payments to
4 attorneys so that they could be reviewed at the end of the
5 year; right? Correct.
6 And that's exactly what they did.
7 That's not the story. That's not the explanation
8 the Government gave you in opening, when they said this was
9 some elaborate way to cover up a hundred and thirty thousand
10 dollar payment.
11 That's not what the evidence showed.
12 So back to the same email.
13 Now we are at the first sentence: "Please pay from
14 The Trust."
15 Now, let's first stop for a minute on this. This
16 is a couple of weeks after President Trump had been
17 inaugurated; right. It's February 17th, 2017. He moved to
18 Washington, D.C., and at that time, as you heard, all of
19 President Trump's assets were moved into a Trust.
20 The purpose of this was to avoid any conflict of
21 interest.
22 And, remember, that that Trust went into effect
23 January 20th, the day that President Trump was sworn into
24 Office, and as there was testimony about that from more than
25 one witness.

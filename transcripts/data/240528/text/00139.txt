1   happened, but the absence of a phone record doesn't prove
2   that a particular call did not happen.
3            Also, keep in mind that aside from a few
4   screenshots from Cohen's phone from the Signal app, there
5   are no records at all about encrypted phone calls between
6   the conspirators in this case.
7            That's the whole point of using an encrypted app,
8   is so that there isn't a record.
9            Finally, some of the conversations in this case
10   took place in person, so there wouldn't be a phone call
11   record of that.
12            The point here is that the fact that there isn't a
13   record of a particular phone call does not mean that a
14   particular conversation did not take place.
15            Fortunately, there are plenty of phone records that
16   actually are in evidence.

18            You can examine them, and you will see that there
19   are -- many of the calls that we talk about in this case
20   are, in fact, proven in the phone records.
21            So, another reoccurring Defense narrative is this
22   notion that Stormy Daniels was trying to extort the
23   Defendant, threatened to go public unless she was paid off;
24   but, that's just not reality.
25            You've got to go beneath the surface here.  Look at

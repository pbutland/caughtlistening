1   illegal, either; but a contract to kill your wife is
2   illegal.
3            It depends what the contract was for. It depends
4   what the NDAs are for.
5            Contracts and NDAs are, indeed, illegal when they
6   serve an unlawful purpose, including when they constitute
7   unlawful campaign contributions.
8            And this is nothing like what had happened in the
9   past between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump.
10            Yes, in the past, Mr. Pecker had declined to
11   print negative stories about Mr. Trump for decades.
12            But, that is fundamentally different from seeking
13   out such stories, to purchase them with the advanced
14   intent of preventing those stories from ever being told.
15            Prior to the August 2015 meeting -- and
16   Mr. Pecker was very clear about this -- he never agreed to
17   publish hit pieces on Mr. Trump's political opponents, he
18   never agreed to be the eyes and ears of Mr. Trump's
19   political campaign, and he never ever paid for a Trump
20   story for the purpose of killing it.
21            No matter how many times the Defense says
22   otherwise, this was not business as usual.
23            And it's true that Mr. Pecker may have crossed
24   the line once or twice before with Rahm Emanuel or with
25   Arnold Schwarzenegger.

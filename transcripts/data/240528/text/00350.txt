Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 that candidate.
2 Cohen's payments to Daniels, in coordination with
3 the Defendant, to keep her quiet for the purpose of
4 influencing the election was a campaign contribution that
5 massively exceeded the $2,700 limit.
6 Defense counsel wants you to think that Cohen's
7 real motivation was protecting Trump's marriage or
8 protecting Trump's family from embarrassment.
9 They spent so much time on that argument because,
10 under the law, paying a candidate's expenses is not a
11 campaign contribution if Cohen would have made the payment
12 "irrespective of the candidacy."
13 But, you don't have to spend any time on that one
14 either, because no one told you he made the Daniels payoff
15 because of the election.
16 And, you have seen a ton of evidence that this
17 payoff was driven by the Defendant's concerns about the
18 potential impact of the Daniels story on the election.
19 The Defendant wanted to squash the story for the
20 same reason he wanted to squash the McDougal story, and the
21 Sajudin story, to avoid the harm these stories might cause
22 to his election prospects.
23 Even more so, because the Daniels story surfaced in
24 the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape and the
25 crisis it caused.

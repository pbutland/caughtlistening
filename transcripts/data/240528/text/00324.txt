1   wouldn't have told Mr. Donald Trump about Daniels during
2   that phone call.  Why won't he have?
3            Cohen said that Mr. Trump was upset to hear that
4   Daniels was back after Cohen and Davidson had successfully

21   he's spoken to Cohen, "All sorted."
22            Both Cohen and Farro testified that on October
23   13th Cohen completed the paperwork to open a bank account

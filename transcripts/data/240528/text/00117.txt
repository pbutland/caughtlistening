Summation/Mr. Blanche

1   looked at the invoices and what was behind the checks.
2   That's just a guess.  And it's reasonable doubt.
3            The second is the Valentine's Day 2017
4   communication that was talked about, the vouchers and the
5   checks.
6            There is no proof that President Trump ever, ever
7   saw anything that Ms. Tarasoff or Mr. McConney did with the
8   vouchers and with the checks.
9            He signed checks as President.
10            Two of the checks he never even saw.  He didn't
11   even sign them.
12            And the others he signed when he was at the White
13   House, running the country in 2017.
14            The third, there is absolutely no evidence of any
15   intent to defraud.
16            There was a 1099 issued.
17            President Trump tweeted exactly what happened when
18   it came out.
19            And he submitted what happened to the Office of
20   Government Ethics when he was President of the United
21   States.
22            That's not evidence of any intent to defraud.
23            Similarly, there is absolutely no intent to
24   unlawfully influence the 2016 election.
25            Now, I expect that with this charge, with this part

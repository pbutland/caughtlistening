1            By the way, even that, even if you find that's
2   true, that's still not enough.
3            It doesn't matter -- as I said to you in the
4   opening statement, it doesn't matter if there was a
5   conspiracy to try to win an election.
6            Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy
7   from another candidate, a group of people who are working
8   together to help somebody win.
9            In order for you to find that there was an intent
10   to conceal an election-related crime, you have to find
11   that this effort was done by unlawful means.
12            I expect the Government will talk about three
13   separate unlawful means. Okay.
14            One. Federal campaign finance violations.
15            Two. Tax violations.
16            And then, the third is his other books and
17   records violations.
18            But, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking
19   about all three of those.
20            None of them make any sense.
21            Let's talk for a minute about that August 2015
22   meeting that you heard a lot about from Mr. Pecker and you
23   heard about from Mr. Cohen. That's, supposedly, where this
24   conspiracy starts.
25            There's an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower.

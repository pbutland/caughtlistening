1             And so, of course, as I told you guys, I updated
2   President Trump every step of the way.  And on October 24th
3   at eight o'clock, it looks like it's Mr. Schiller, yes,
4   because he was the bodyguard.  I would call Mr. Schiller.
5   That is what he told you.  That was his sworn testimony.
6             It was a lie.  And this isn't a lie about whether
7   he had an engagement relationship with Mr. Costello.  This
8   isn't a little lie about whether he -- what he thought
9   about President Trump back them, or what his motivation
10   was.  This was a lie about the charged conduct involving
11   Ms. Daniels.
12             He told you he talked to President Trump on
13   October 24th at 8:02 p.m., updating him about the Daniels'
14   situation.  That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.
15             We all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk
16   about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him
17   for several days, and he forgot to block his number, and
18   Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that.
19             And you know that not only from the call logs and
20   what happened, but the fact that the second they hung up
21   that 90-second call, Mr. Cohen texted Mr. Schiller the
22   number of the 14-year-old.  And the very next text to
23   Mr. Schiller the next morning was asking for a follow-up.
24             That is perjury.
25             Now, what did the Government do in response to

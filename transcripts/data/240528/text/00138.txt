7            I will give you an example:
8            There are eleven unique phone numbers, phone

11            We only have phone records for two of those
12   numbers.

14   landline at work.
15            We don't have his landline at home.
16            And we certainly don't have his office line from
17   the White House.
18            We also don't have the outgoing calls from
19   Mr. Cohen's landlines, despite what Mr. Blanche told you
20   just now, a few minutes ago.  There are no outgoing calls
21   from that number.
22            One of the phone company representatives told you

24   and we are fortunate to have what we have.
25            So, a phone record proves that a particular call

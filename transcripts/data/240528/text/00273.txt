Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4728
1            Notice how 180,000 falls into that range, but not
2   360 or 420,000.
3            Because the amount being reimbursed, as this says,
4   was $180,000 or was within that range.
5            And, the defendant has admitted that this was a
6   reimbursement in his own Tweets.
7            Then President Trump denied that this payment had
8   anything to do with the campaign.
9            Now, that's just plain false.  We have been through
10   about two hours of testimony and exhibits and evidence that
11   shows that it had everything to do with the campaign.
12            He may not have used campaign funds to pay off
13   Daniels, and he has never been accused of that, but as
14   we've seen, the payment had everything to do with the
15   campaign.
16            It was an unlawful campaign contribution to the
17   campaign.
18            It was not a payment by the campaign.
19            But, more importantly, the defendant has admitted
20   that the payments to Cohen were a reimbursement for a NDA.
21             And, yet, they still try to argue that the payments
22   to Cohen in 2017 were for legal services rendered, because
23   to say anything else is to admit that the business records
24   were false.
25            And they can't do that.

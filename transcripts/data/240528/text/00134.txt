Proceedings

1            The Defense does not object to the proposed
2   instruction regarding the sentence or punishment; therefore,
3   I will give it exactly as it's written.
4            I'm not going to give the other instruction from
5   the bench.
6            I can understand why you are frustrated at this
7   point with the comments that were made by Mr. Blanche on his
8   summation.
9            However, I think at this point for that instruction
10   to come from the bench to the jury would simply call more
11   attention to it than it's worth, so I'm not going to do it
12   at this time.
13            Let's get the jury, please.
14            THE SERGEANT:  All rise.
15            Jury entering.
16            (Jury enters.)
17              **********
18            THE COURT:  You may be seated.
19            THE CLERK:  Case on trial continued.  All jurors
20   are present and properly seated.
21            THE COURT:  Jurors, before we hear the People's
22   summation, there is an instruction that I wanted to give
23   you.
24            During the Defense summation, you heard Mr. Blanche
25   asking, in substance, that you not send the defendant to

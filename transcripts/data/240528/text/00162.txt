1            It's actually neither. Because they're wrong on
2   both accounts.
3            If it is his purpose -- if Cohen's purpose were
4   to come in here to lie, how easy would it have been for
5   him to go further, to say that the Defendant admitted to
6   sleeping with Karen McDougal or Stormy Daniels?
7            In fact -- I don't know if you remember this. It
8   was a small point. But, Cohen testified that he flat-out
9   asked Mr. Trump whether he slept with Ms. Daniels, and
10   Mr. Trump didn't answer. He just said she was a beautiful
11   woman.
12            So, if Mr. Cohen wanted to lie for the Defendant,
13   he could have easily said: The Defendant said, yeah, he
14   slept with her, it was the greatest night of his life,
15   whatever.
16            But, that's not what he was doing.
17            Cohen could have easily said he went over every
18   line with every contract with these NDAs with Mr. Trump.
19            But, instead, he said that he updated Mr. Trump
20   when he locked these things down or when some major
21   development happened. He didn't get into the nitty-gritty
22   of what every contract said.
23            Or, he could have said that he and the Defendant
24   overtly discussed the facts that the NDAs in this case
25   violated Federal Election Law.

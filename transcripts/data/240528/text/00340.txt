5 testimony, to the recorded conversation about different
6 ways to reimburse Pecker.
7 Even all of this evidence about the Defendant's
8 participation in the conspiracy to influence the election
9 and his general approach to business and life. It's just
10 inconceivable that he would be so involved in buying these
11 women's silence and then suddenly stick his head in the
12 sand when it came to Cohen's reimbursement.
13 Second. Cohen was and is a selfâ€”promoter. It
14 simply defies all common sense to think that he would
15 undertake these Herculean efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump
16 and then keep them to himself.
17 Fixers like him may try not to leave a paper
18 trail to lead to their principal, but they sure as heck
19 want the principal to know.
20 You know from Pecker that Cohen had told
21 Mr. Trump about the Sajudin and McDougal deals, and Trump
22 thanked Pecker for his roles in those deals.
23 So, why would Cohen tell Mr. Trump about the
24 deals that AMI funded, but not the deals that he, himself,
25 laid out his own money for?

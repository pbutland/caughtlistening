1 market". That's the phrase that he used.
2 Now, they're not talking about helping jump—start
3 Karen McDougal's career here. They're talking about how to
4 protect the campaign from the story that she was prepared
5 to tell.
6 And the way that all ended was that the Defendant
7 told Pecker, "Let me think about it, and 1 will have
8 Michael Cohen call you back in a few days."
9 Now, with all of the evidence and documents in
10 this case, it's easy to lose sight of the significance of
11 this phone call. Because, unless you believe that Pecker
12 is lying, this call means, first of all, that the
13 Defendant knew Karen McDougal well enough to describe her
14 as "a nice girl"; two, that Mr. Trump was overtly
15 discussing purchasing her story to keep it from being
16 published; and third, that Mr. Trump explicitly told
17 Pecker that Cohen was the intermediary, that Cohen would
18 get back to Pecker in a few days with Mr. Trump's
19 decision.
20 So, Trump is deputizing Cohen right in front of
21 Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go—ahead from Cohen
22 is a go—ahead from Trump.
23 This call makes it impossible for the Defense to
24 claim that Cohen was acting on his own, that he was taking
25 it upon himself to work with AMI to purchase the McDougal

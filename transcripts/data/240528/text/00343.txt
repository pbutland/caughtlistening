Summation/Steinglass
4798
1            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
2            THE COURT:  Sustained.
3            MR. STEINGLASS:  The point is, Mr. Trump doesn't
4   have to do each of these acts himself. He can act in
5   concert with others.
6            That's what the allegation is.
7            All 34 counts of the indictment charge falsifying
8   business records in the first degree, and each count
9   requires us to prove that the Defendant, either personally
10   or acting in concert with others, made or caused a false
11   entry in the business records of an enterprise; and, two,
12   that he did so with the intent to defraud, that included
13   the intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal
14   the commission of another crime.
15            So, the first element is obvious.
16            We've already established that the Defendant --
17            MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
18            THE COURT:  Sustained.
19            I'll instruct them on the law and the evidence.
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  We have established that the
21   Defendant made or caused false entries in the business
22   records.
23            No one is saying the Defendant actually got
24   behind a computer and typed in the false vouchers or
25   stamped the false invoices or printed the false checks.

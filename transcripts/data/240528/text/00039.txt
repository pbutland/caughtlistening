10 Is there any other proof of that? Any other
11 evidence? No. There's none.
12 Mr. McConney said something very similar.
13 When asked what Mr. Weisselberg maybe meant by
14 "gross it up": "Nobody would know. Nobody would know."
15 So, the witnesses that testified in this
16 courtroom, one says, "I didn't know and I didn't care,"
17 and the other says, "Nobody would know."
18 And based on that, I suggest, the Government is
19 going to suggest to you that there may have been some sort
20 of tax scheme involved here, as well.
21 That's it. That's the proof.
22 You saw no evidence of the tax scheme by anybody
23 for this $420,000. Not The Trump Organization. Not the
24 personal expenses for President Trump. Not even Mr. Cohen.

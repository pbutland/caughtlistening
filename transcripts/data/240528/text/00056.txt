1            Keep in mind, there is nothing unusual --
2   Mr. Pecker told you this -- about catching and killing.
3            What did Mr. Pecker tell you? He said they only
4   published about half the stories that they bought. Half
5   the stories. Half the stories.
6            So -- and, by the way, Mr. Pecker knows a lot;
7   right.
8            He took the stand a month ago.
9            I know that you've seen a lot of testimony since
10   then.
11            But, he's been in this industry for decades; and
12   so, when he talks about the work that he had done over the
13   years and the way that he ran AMI, he was speaking from
14   experience.
15            So, when he tells you that he had never heard
16   "catch and kill" until the investigation or until a news
17   article about it sometime relatively recently, that's
18   meaningful. That's meaningful.
19            When he tells you that half the stories that the
20   National Enquirer buys, they don't publish, that's
21   meaningful. That matters.
22            So, let's talk about the three catch and kills.
23            The first one. Dino Sajudin. A supposed love
24   child.
25            Completely 100 percent false. Everybody told you

1       all or any portion of the testimony read back to you.
2                Fourth, remember, under our law, I am responsible
3       for explaining the law, not the lawyers.
4                If you think there is any difference between what
5       the lawyers may have said and what I say the law is, your
6       sworn duty as jurors is to follow my instructions on the
7       law, as you have promised me that you would.

20       whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.
21                Remember, under our law, you, the jury, judge the
22       facts, if any, to determine which facts, if any, have been
23       proven and whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty,
24       not I and not the lawyers.

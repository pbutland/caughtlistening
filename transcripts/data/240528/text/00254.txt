Summations - People/Steinglass

1             Think about who McConney is.  He was the
2   Controller and a loyal Trump Organization employee for 34
3   years.  He has no axe to grind.  He has every incentive to
4   help his former boss.
5             But he told you that he knew that this was a
6   reimbursement because that's what Weisselberg told him it
7   was.
8             Mr. Blanche pretended that this was all coming
9   from Michael Cohen.
10             But this document, these two documents, People's
11   35 and 36, these are Trump Organization documents.  It came
12   from them, and it was admitted into evidence through Jeff
13   McConney.
14             These two Exhibits, People's 35 and 36, are the
15   over-manifestation of the agreement of falsified business
16   records.
17             In other words, they are the smoking guns.
18             They completely blow out of the water the Defense
19   claim that the monies paid to Cohen were payments for legal
20   services rendered in 2017.
21             I am almost speechless that they are still trying
22   to make this argument that the payments in 2017 were for
23   legal services rendered.
24             These documents just completely blow that out of
25   the water.

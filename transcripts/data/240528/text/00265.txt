1            And the -- and the phone extraction that Doug Daus
2   did from Cohen's phone showed a 4:33 meeting with POTUS --
3   President of the United States -- on February 8th of 2017.
4             And there is also an email from Madeleine
5   Westerhout in evidence confirming this meeting time and the
6   accuracy of the data on Cohen's phone.
7            So, there is another reason that you can rely on
8   the data from his phone.
9            And, shortly thereafter, a series of invoices,
10   vouchers and checks followed.
11            February 14th, Cohen emails McConney.
12            He apologizes for the delay, and he asks that the
13   checks be mailed to his home address.
14            And McConney reminds Cohen that he has to send
15   invoices first.
16            He doesn't say retainer.  There is no retainer.
17   Not an oral retainer.  Not a written retainer.  There is no
18   retainer.
19            And Cohen -- and McConney doesn't ask for the
20   retainer -- for a retainer, a nonexistent retainer, he asks
21   for invoices.
22            And the response to this has to be one of my
23   favorite emails in the whole case, because Cohen doesn't
24   even remember the reimbursement amount.
25            McConney is the one with the documentation.  They

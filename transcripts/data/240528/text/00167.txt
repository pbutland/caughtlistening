Summation/Steinglass
4622
1            And Michael Cohen came to his day of reckoning.
2   He decided to put loyalty to his family above that blind
3   loyalty that he had given the Defendant for the previous
4   ten years.
5            And he came clean.
6            And when it comes to the facts of this case, he
7   has been consistently describing the events that took
8   place in this case for six years.
9            In fact, he explained that when he testified in
10   Congress in 2019. He apologized to the American people for
11   lying and for suppressing information that the citizenry
12   had a right to know before choosing their President.
13            And as we discussed in jury selection, the
14   question is not whether you like Cohen or whether you want
15   to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he
16   has useful, reliable information to give you about what
17   went down in this case.
18            And the truth is, that he was in the best
19   position to know. He was in the best position to know
20   because he was the Defendant's right hand. He was in the
21   best position to know about the conspiracy to influence
22   the election, and he was in the best position to know
23   about the false business records that the Defendant
24   created to hide that conspiracy.

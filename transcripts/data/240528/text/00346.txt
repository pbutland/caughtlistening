1   voting public.
2            These weren't an accident or oversight. They were
3   designed to obscure the Election Law, including the
4   repayment to Cohen for the Daniels NDA.
5            I'm not going to bore you by going through all
6   that evidence again.
7            The intent that we need to prove included the
8   intent to commit, aid or conceal another crime, as I said.
9            And that doesn't mean that he actually committed,
10   aided or concealed; just that he had that intent.
11            So, what crime do we suggest that he intended to
12   commit, aid or conceal?
13            The answers is: New York City Election Law.
14            Again, the judge will define that crime for you.
15   I'm not going to do that.
16            You need two or more people conspiring to promote
17   or prevent the election, as we've talked about, of any
18   public officer by unlawful means, and at least one
19   conspirator has to act on that conspiracy.
20            So, as to the conspiracy to promote or prevent
21   the election, we're basically beating a dead horse here.
22            You've seen a mountain of evidence that proves
23   that the Defendant, Pecker, Cohen, and Howard conspired to
24   influence the 2016 Presidential election.
25            That was the whole purpose of the Trump Tower

Summation/Mr. Blanche
4577
1            Again, those text messages were not shown to you by
2   the Government; they were shown to you by us on
3   cross-examination.
4            And, third, Mr. Cohen's phone.
5            Do you remember a few weeks ago, when a
6   representative from the District Attorney's Office named
7   Douglas Daus testified about how he had searched Mr. Cohen's
8   two phones?  CP1 was one of the phones.
9            But, what did they not tell you until cross?
10            He didn't tell you that Mr. Cohen had actually
11   wiped his phone on October 15th of 2016.
12            That's about five or six weeks after this recording
13   was supposedly made.
14            Mr. Daus did not tell you that Mr. Cohen actually
15   synced the phone with his computer, with his laptop, on
16   January 25th, 2017.
17            And you haven't seen any evidence that the laptop
18   was ever searched.
19            Mr. Daus did not tell you that Mr. Cohen synced the
20   phone again in October of 2020.
21            He said that on cross.
22            And, by the way, we don't even know -- we don't
23   have any information about what device was actually used for
24   that sync.
25            But, we do know -- we do know that that September

1       the way, as both she and Mr. McConney told you, every single
2       invoice that came to The Trump Organization, whether
3       President Trump's personal accounts or elsewhere that came
4       from a lawyer or a law firm, was booked the same way, as a
5       legal expense.
6                So, back to that email.
7                There is no other way to categorize an invoice
8       from a lawyer to President Trump than to call it a legal
9       expense.  The Government has criminalized that, has said
10       that that was a crime, what Ms. Tarasoff did.  That's
11       absurd.  It's not a crime.
12                This is what Mr. McConney said about that, payments
13       to the Trump lawyers by The Trump Organization are legal
14       expenses.  That's why you booked them that way on the
15       General Ledger.  Yes.  That's how they were booked.
16                And you can see that, again, on the voucher that
17       I'm displaying, on the pull out.
18                Same thing from McConney, confirming what I said
19       a moment ago, that there is basically just a drop down
20       menu.
21                This isn't Ms. Tarasoff creating some long
22       explanation for how somebody should be -- how an expense or
23       an invoice should be categorized in the system, it's a drop
24       down menu and it's called "legal expense."
25                Now, you heard from Mr. McConney the reason why

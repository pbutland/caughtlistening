1   explained to Cohen how we, meaning he, and Allen
2   Weisselberg and Trump, preferred to break the payments up
3   over 12 months, even though Cohen preferred a lump sum.
4   And Mr. Trump approved the payment plan.
5             This is from the testimony.
6             Question:  Now, what happened when you went into
7   Mr. Trump's office to have this discussion?
8             Answer:  During the discussion, Allen turned

11   are going to pay you over 12 months.  It was probably

13             No, no, no.  Why don't you just do it over 12
14   months, and it will be paid out to you monthly.
15             Question:  Did he say anything about how it would
16   be paid out to you?
17             Answer:  Yeah.  He said like -- as like for legal
18   services rendered since I was then being given a title of
19   Personal Attorney to the President.
20             Question:  And we will get to that in a second.
21             So this conversation that you had with
22   Mr. Weisselberg in Mr. Trump's office, with Mr. Trump?
23   Answer:  Yes.

1   you a note, it's 8 o'clock.
2            At that point, we really need to wrap it up at
3   that point.
4            Anything else?
5            Let's get the jury.

8            THE CLERK:  Please be seated.
9            THE COURT:  Jurors, thank you again for your
10   flexibility.  We're taking full advantage of it tonight.
11            Mr. Steinglass.
12            MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
13            Thanks for sticking with me.
14            So, yesterday -- earlier today, it feels like
15   yesterday, I mentioned that one of the three things that we
16   have to prove in this case is that the defendant made or
17   caused false business records, and that he did so with the
18   intent to defraud.
19            We have gone through a ton of evidence showing his
20   involvement at every step.
21            But, it is easy to lose sight of the details of
22   the transactions and all the back and forth among all the
23   players who are involved.
24            So, I just want to quickly highlight some of the
25   evidence of the defendant's direct involvement throughout

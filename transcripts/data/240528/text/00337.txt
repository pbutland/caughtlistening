7   Defendant should buy the McDougal story; was recorded on

9   for purchasing McDougal's life rights; called Cohen the

11   to approve it; spoke to Cohen six minutes after Pecker
12   told Cohen that Rodriguez was shopping the Stormy Daniels
13   story again; spoke to Pecker late at night before Pecker

19   wire transfer process; spoke with Cohen the same day that

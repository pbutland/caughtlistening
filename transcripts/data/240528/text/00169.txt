1 documents tell you everything you need to know.
2 You don't need Michael Cohen to connect these
3 dots. But, as the ultimate insider, he can help you to do
4 just that.
5 In order to really understand what was going on
6 here, you do have to kind of roll up your sleeves a little
7 and get into those documents.
8 We've done this throughout the trial piece by
9 piece, but it's easier when you put all of the evidence
10 together into a timeline.
11 You don't have to study this right now. This is
12 just a foreshadowing of the August 2015 meeting at Trump
13 Tower, which is really the prism through which you should
14 analyze the evidence in this case. Three rich and powerful
15 men, high up in Trump Tower, trying to become even more
16 powerful by controlling the flow of information that might
17 reach the voters.
18 Mr. Blanche made some allusions to this.
19 Hope Hicks tells you she remembers seeing
20 Mr. Pecker in Trump Tower and was not part of this
21 conversation, even though she was in and out of meetings
22 at all times. She said it's certainly possible she was in
23 and out of a meeting with Mr. Pecker at some point.
24 This makes perfect sense. This is not the kind
25 of thing you want to discuss in front of your press

Summation/Steinglass

1 (Continued from the previous page.)
2 (Whereupon, a Power Point presentation containing
3 exhibits and transcript excerpts are played on the screens
4 throughout the following summationz)
5 MR. STEINGLASS: But that's just another false
6 narrative sprung by the defense to get you to ignore the
7 evidence.
8 The Defendant remained involved, even with minor
9 decisions about where his money was going.
10 Ms. Westerhout testified on direct examination
11 that she had dozens of communications with The Trump
12 Organization in 2017, that they were in constant contact
13 about scheduling the Defendant's contacts and his personal
14 expenses.
15 She noted that both Weisselberg and Cohen were on
16 the Defendant's short list of preferred contacts so they
17 could reach him whenever they needed to.
18 Westerhout recalled that maybe a couple of times
19 she knew that the Defendant would actually call
20 Weisselberg or someone else in The Trump Organization with
21 a question about a check that he was considering signing.
22 And Ms. Necheles desperately tried to walk that
23 back on crossâ€”examination.
24 But, you can read the testimony as a whole for
25 yourself.

1   said that Michael Cohen is going to make him look very bad
2   with his two top sources.
3             And he said, you understand when you renege with
4   a source what the impact would be.
5             So, he asked if I would get Michael Cohen on the
6   phone.
7             I set up a Signal call to Michael Cohen.  So, it
8   was Michael Cohen, myself and Dylan Howard.
9             Howard was very aggressive on the phone with
10   Michael Cohen for not paying.
11             Michael Cohen said, that I should pay.
12             He said, David, you should pay.
13             I said, I am not paying for this story.  I don't
14   want to be involved.  I didn't want to be involved in this
15   from the beginning.
16             I said, I am not doing it.
17             I said, Michael, my suggestion to you, you should
18   buy the story.  You should take it off the market because
19   if you don't, and it gets out, I believe The Boss will be
20   very angry with you.
21             And so, then Davidson -- Davidson then speaks to
22   Howard.  And Howard reaches out to Cohen and tells him that
23   Davidson is calling you urgently.
24             He says, we have to coordinate something on the
25   matter he is calling you about or it could look awfully bad

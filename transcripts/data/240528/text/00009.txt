Summation/Mr. Blanche

1       vouchered certain evidence on the personal records of
2       President Trump; something beyond the word of a woman who
3       claims that something happened in 2006.
4                You should demand more than the testimony of Keith
5       Davidson, an attorney who really was just trying to extort
6       money from President Trump in the lead up to the 2016
7       election.
8                And there are consequences, the consequences of the
9       utter lack of proof that you all heard over the past five
10       weeks is simple:  It's a not guilty verdict.  Period.
11                Now, this morning we are going to -- I'm going to
12       spend some time talking to you about the evidence that you
13       all saw over the past five weeks.
14                But it is also not just about what you saw and what
15       you heard in this courtroom, but also what you didn't hear.
16       This case -- this case is about documents.  It's a paper
17       case.
18                This case is not about an encounter with Stormy
19       Daniels 18 years ago; an encounter that President Trump has
20       unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred.
21                It's not even about a confidential settlement in
22       2016 and a Non-disclosure Agreement with Stormy Daniels that
23       was signed nearly eight years ago.
24                It goes to the charges, the reason why we're here,
25       the reason why you all are here, is whether and to what

Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 And he tells Pecker to take it down immediately.
2 So, Pecker testifies that he called up Howard and
3 that Howard promised to remove it. And Pecker asked Howard
4 to notify Cohen when it was taken care of.
5 This is exactly what Howard did. He emailed
6 Cohen, "1 have deleted the text story completely. It no
7 longer exists."
8 At the same time, Hope Hicks testified that she
9 asked Cohen to use his media contacts to figure out whether
10 there were any other damaging videotapes out there.
11 So, they were privately scrubbing the internet and
12 chasing down rumors to ensure that their public efforts to
13 spin the Access Hollywood tape didn't backfire.
14 More back and forth calls. Howard to Pecker,
15 Cohen to Hicks, Pecker to Hicks, and then Howard forwards
16 to Hicks the confirmation that that Playboy Man article no
17 longer exists.
18 So, this is not a catch and kill exactly, but they
19 are purging the internet at the direction of, and for the
20 benefit of the campaign.
21 And, again, this is not a normal legitimate press
22 function either.
23 Immediately after that, Cohen calls the defendant
24 and they speak for eight minutes about several different
25 matters.

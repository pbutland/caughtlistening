Summation/Mr. Blanche
4478
1                Now, next, let's talk about the vouchers.  There
2       are 12 of them, as you know.
3                There are 12 vouchers that are at issue in this
4       case.
5                In this case, I put one of them up on the screen
6       for you to see, to remind you.
7                And, again, this is from The Trump Organization's
8       MDS system as you heard about from Mr. McConney and
9       Ms. Tarasoff.
10                Remember, Mr. McConney told you that it was an
11       antiquated accounting system back in 2017.
12                But, also, and significantly, there is no evidence
13       that President Trump knew anything about this voucher
14       system.  No evidence.  Not a single word.
15                Now, I don't know how the Government is going to
16       address that.
17                But let me tell you this, if the Government reads
18       to you quotes from a book a decade earlier, sometimes more
19       than a decade earlier, you should be suspicious.  That's a
20       red flag.
21                If the reason the Government is going to ask you to
22       conclude that President Trump knew anything about this
23       voucher system is because of something that he wrote in a
24       book, where he was assisted by ghost writers, decades
25       earlier, there is a problem in the proof.

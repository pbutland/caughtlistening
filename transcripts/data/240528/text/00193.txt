1   loop.
2            Howard tells Cohen that McDougal rejected their
3   offer; that Davidson is worried that she's been convinced,
4   if you remember, by the estrogen mafia to go with ABC.
5            So, Howard tells Cohen he implored Davidson to
6   get it done and ensures Cohen that Davidson would get back
7   to him.
8            And they agree on the broad strokes of the deal.
9            They just have to agree to get Karen McDougal to
10   play ball.
11            So, Cohen tells Davidson they will: "Lay it on
12   thick for her."
13            Davidson says:  "Good. Throw in an ambassadorship
14   for me. I'm thinking of the Isle of Mann. LOL. I'm going
15   to Make Australia Great Again."
16            The joke is funny because it's a palpable
17   explanation of what they're doing.  They're helping
18   Mr. Trump get elected. They're doing that by squashing the
19   Karen McDougal story.
20            Everyone understood what this was about.
21            Trump is looming behind everything they're doing.
22            Later that same evening, Howard tries to convince
23   Davidson that AMI is a better option for McDougal than
24   ABC, and he tells McDougal flat-out that he needs the deal
25   to happen. Howard doesn't want to let Mr. Trump down.

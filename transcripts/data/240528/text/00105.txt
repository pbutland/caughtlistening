Summation - Defense/Blanche
4560
1             Now, I want to talk for a few minutes about the
2   Agreement itself.
3             There is no dispute that President Trump never
4   signed the Agreement.  He never signed the side letter.
5             And the Government wants you to believe that Mr.
6   Cohen and the President discussed this Agreement on
7   multiple occasions because Ms. Daniels, at the time, was
8   this massive threat to the campaign.
9             They want you to believe that President Trump
10   thought that this could cost him the election, but, yet, he
11   never signed the Agreement.
12             So, if that were the case, how would that
13   Agreement be enforced?
14             So, remember the testimony about that?
15             Mr. Cohen tried to tell you that the whole
16   purpose of the Non-Disclosure Agreement was to ensure that
17   the Trump name was not disclosed, so that Donald J. Trump
18   was never part of this Agreement, but that was not true.
19   That's not the reason that President Trump did not sign it,
20   and that's not the reason I believe Mr. Cohen signed it.
21             And the reason why you know that is, is because
22   Mr. Cohen wrote -- wrote -- he actually wrote President
23   Trump's name into the side letter.  So, it is Mr. Cohen
24   himself, and only Mr. Cohen, who attached President Trump's
25   name to the transaction, not President Trump.

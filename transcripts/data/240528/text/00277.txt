Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4732
1 were falsely described as payments for services rendered in
2 a particular month of 2017 and pursuant to a Retainer
3 Agreement that didn't exist.
4 These weren't really legal expenses at all because
5 the defendant didn't actually pay a lawyer.
6 He paid a porn star by funneling money through a
7 lawyer.
8 Each of these records is a false business record.
9 Tarasoff then uses the same system to create the
10 checks and the check stubs and the stubs and the attached
11 checks.
12 Those are also false business records because they
13 also contain a false reference to a nonâ€”existent retainer
14 for a particular month.
15 And for each check, there are two checks stubs and
16 the check itself, all on a single sheet of paper.
17 If you see the check, you see the check stub,
18 necessarily.
19 Tarasoff also placed an accounts payable stamp on
20 the email chain that includes the phony invoice.
21 And those invoices are stamped and kept and
22 maintained by The Trump Organization to justify the checks,
23 that's how the Accounting Department works.
24 And they were stapled to the checks so that the
25 person signing the checks would have the necessary backup

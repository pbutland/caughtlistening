Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 my decision.
2 Michael Cohen is not some rouge actor here. He's
3 acting at the direction of the defendant. And you don't
4 have to take Cohenâ€˜s word for that. Unless you think that
5 Pecker was lying about this, this conclusively demonstrates
6 that several weeks before the McDougal NDA is signed, the
7 defendant is overtly discussing with Pecker, whether he,
8 the defendant, should purchase her story to make sure it
9 didn't get published.
10 There is no middleman in this conversation. No
11 buffer.
12 And after the deal is signed on August 5th,
13 Pecker is understandably anxious to get his money back
14 because he only purchased the story with the understanding
15 that the defendant would reimburse him. Not Cohen, the
16 defendant.
17 Pecker is so persistent that Cohen actually tapes
18 the defendant discussing the reimbursement. I am certainly
19 not going to play the tape for you again. But, you clearly
20 have Mr. Trump discussing reimbursing AMI for the money
21 they had spent acquiring Ms. McDougal's life rights.
22 The defense just can't get away from this, no
23 matter how hard they try. This is proof outside of Cohen
24 of Mr. Trump's direct involvement in one of the many
25 aspects of this criminal conspiracy.

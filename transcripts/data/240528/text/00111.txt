2 (Whereupon, the following proceedings are continued
3 from the preceding page.)
4 MR. BLANCHE: (Continuing.) There are no calls to
5 President Trump on that day from Mr. Cohen's phones. Any of
6 them.
7 President Trump's phone records are in evidence.
8 You can look at them.
9 You will see no phone call.
10 Now, is that the biggest lie in the world? Maybe
11 not; right.
12 The Government shows Mr. Cohen a text and says ——
13 from President Trump's wife that says: "Please call DJT."
14 Mr. Cohen swears to tell the truth and he says, oh,
15 yeah, I called him, yeah, probably from my landline.
16 It was a lie.
17 There are no records. There are no records.
18 You can see President Trump's phone number. You
19 can see all of the people that he spoke with.
20 Heck, you can look at Keith Schiller that day. You
21 can look at Hope Hicks.
22 You can look at all of the folks that testified in
23 front of you about being around President Trump at that
24 point during the campaign.
25 No calls from Mr. Cohen.

1 Anything criminal about that? No. That’s the way Retainer
2 Agreements work. You are on call. Just like Michael Cohen
3 was on call with President Trump.
4 Now, when the Government talks to you about these
5 invoices by Mr. Cohen, as I expect they will later today,
6 and uses the phrase, "For Services Rendered," what you see
7 on the screen, that’s a true statement, period.
8 And that's —— that’s not evidence of some secret
9 agreement that Mr. Cohen had with President Trump. He
10 broadcast this fact to the world.
11 Remember, he told you that after he had a meeting
12 and it was established that he would be the Personal
13 Attorney to President Trump, he rolled right into Sean
14 Hannity.
15 He talked to every reporter that he could, pushing
16 the fact that he was going to be the Personal Attorney to
17 Mr. Trump.
18 He put that signature block on every single email
19 that he sent in 2017.
20 This was not a secret.
21 Michael Cohen was President Trump’s Personal
22 Attorney. Period.
23 Now, I talked a little bit about the Retainer
24 Agreement a minute ago.
25 But many of the invoices also talk about Retainer

5            MR. STEINGLASS:  But even if you're not convinced
6   that both conversations happened in that call, a far less
7   sinister explanation is that Cohen could have just gotten
8   the date and the time of that particular conversation
9   wrong.
10            Despite what Mr. Blanche said, this was not any
11   critical moment in time. This was one update of many.
12            I believe, Mr. Cohen testified that he spoke to
13   the Defendant maybe 20 times, giving him updates on this
14   case, in the month of October.
15            This was not the final go-ahead. This will come
16   two days later, on October 26th.
17            And we'll get back to that. Because that was
18   right before Cohen walked over to the bank.
19            Think about this logically. You know you had a
20   conversation around a particular time. You see a call
21   record in that window. And it's a natural assumption that
22   the conversation happened during that call. But, you still
23   remember that you updated the Defendant regularly.
24            Let me give you an example. Let's say that you
25   had dinner at a restaurant a few years ago with an old

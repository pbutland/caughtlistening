1            So, you have -- and that's because it's true.
2   That's because it's true:  You do not need a Retainer
3   Agreement in writing.  Potentially, to get paid you do.  To
4   get paid, you do.  And that's certainly the law.
5            But there is another exception to that law, which
6   clearly applies to Mr. Cohen, if you are continuing in the
7   same role and job that you've had prior to entering into a
8   no-Retainer-Agreement-in-writing relationship.
9            Mr. Cohen himself testified on direct, cross, and
10   redirect that his job was exactly the same in 2017 that it
11   was in 2016.
12            THE COURT:  Let me hear your comment about prison.
13            MR. BLANCHE:  Pardon?
14            THE COURT:  Let me hear you about your comment
15   about prison.
16            MR. BLANCHE:  I mean, your Honor, there is already
17   an instruction that you are going to give as part of the
18   charge on that.
19            And so, we don't think that there needs to be a
20   curative instruction.
21            THE COURT:  I'm going to give a curative
22   instruction.
23            I think that saying that was outrageous,
24   Mr. Blanche --
25            Please have a seat.

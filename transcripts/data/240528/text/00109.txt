Summation - Defense/Blanche

1   of you, the jury, and it matters.  The oath matters the
2   most.
3             He lied.
4             Now, there was another time when he lied to you.
5             The Government showed Mr. Cohen a text message
6   from the President's wife.
7             It said:  Please call the President.
8             And as the People know, there is no call from Mr.
9   Cohen from his cell phone to President Trump right
10   afterwards.
11             But Mr. Cohen told you that he believed he placed
12   the call from his landline.
13             Okay, fair enough.  Fair enough.
14             Mr. Cohen's landline is in evidence.  You can
15   look at it.
16             His number at The Trump Organization where he
17   said he was working that day was 212-836-3212.
18             He told you that on direct.  The records from
19   that line are in evidence at this time.
20             MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
21             THE COURT:  Sustained.
22             MR. BLANCHE:  The records are in evidence.
23             THE COURT:  Approach.
24                  (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
25             record.)

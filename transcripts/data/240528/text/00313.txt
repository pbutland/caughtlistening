1   Daniels and Cohen to back off.
2            There's something else about this post that you
3   should see.
4            We know it's a lie.
5            Even Rhona Graff, Mr. Trump's loyal assistant for
6   decades, testified Daniels was at Trump Tower to meet the
7   Defendant on one occasion and that she kept Daniels' phone
8   number among Trump's contacts; as Ms. Daniels testified.
9            And we actually put into evidence contacts from
10   her phone for both Ms. Graff and Mr. Schiller.
11            Ask yourselves:  Why did the Defendant lie about
12   this, and why did he do it while the Grand Jury was
13   considering charges in this case?
14            People lie for a reason.
15            And if the relationship between the Defendant and
16   Stormy Daniels were purely a business relationship, as the
17   Defense has claimed, what would be the need for the
18   Defendant having to deny having any contact with her other
19   than on that golf course?
20            Shortly after the indictment was unsealed in this
21   case, on March 13, 2018, the Defendant sued Stormy Daniels
22   for half a million dollars. And the lawsuit included
23   claims related to Cohen's testimony in the Grand Jury.
24            Now, yes, the Defendant ultimately abandoned that
25   lawsuit.

Summation — Defense/Blanche
4546
1 Agreement in October of 2016.
2 There is also no evidence, as I said a few
3 minutes ago, except for Mr. Cohen's words, that President
4 Trump knew about that Agreement in 2016.
5 And you can look, by the way, just for a few
6 minutes, at the texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan
7 Howard.
8 Are you working in favor of Trump?
9 Mr. Howard, 1 am not, no.
10 He references David Pecker's endorsement of Trump
11 and makes it clear that he is not part of this effort from
12 the Summer of 2015 meeting, and this is starting in April.
13 And so, again, you know he wasn't part of the
14 effort because if he was part of the effort to catch and
15 kill stories in April, there would have been an effort to
16 catch and kill the Daniels story, and there wasn't.
17 So, what's clear is that Mr. Howard had nothing
18 to do with this conspiracy. He didn't want President Trump
19 to get elected. He didn't want President Trump to be
20 successful.
21 And, again, the texting into June, 2016, which
22 again, is the exact timeframe, remember, that Pecker and
23 Mr. Howard are dealing with the McDougal situation, and so,
24 if there was really —— if it was really true that the
25 Daniels situation was part of this catch and kill scheme,

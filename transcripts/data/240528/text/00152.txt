Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4607
1 They are denying that the 420,000 was a
2 reimbursement at all. They are claiming it was payment for
3 legal services rendered in 2017.
4 We will get to why that's ridiculous later.
5 But, if that's true, then there was no theft;
6 right? He's not getting paid back for Red Finch, he's
7 getting paid for legal services in 2017.
8 So, they can call him a thief or claim this wasnâ€˜t
9 really a reimbursement, but not both.
10 And, of course, you know from the documents, which
11 we will look at later, that these payments were, indeed, a
12 reimbursement.
13 Now, the Defense has urged you to reject
14 Mr. Cohen's testimony because he has made and is still
15 making money from talking about many of the things that this
16 case involves, his books and his podcasts.
17 And that's also true. We agree with that.
18 And he even sells merchandise relating to his
19 desire to see the Defendant convicted.
20 I think Mr. Blanche put up a slide about that.
21 None of that is a crime.
22 And I suspect that he will continue to do that,
23 regardless of the outcome of this trial.
24 He has been convicted of multiple felonies. He has
25 had to sell his real estate. He can't get a new bank loan

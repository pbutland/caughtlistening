Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4661
1            If you want to, you should take this recording in
2   the back.  You can request all the evidence you want.  Any
3   or all of it.  You could play this as many times and as
4   loudly as you want to hear Mr. Trump say "One-fifty" on
5   this tape.
6            It's your decision what the tape says.  But, my
7   guess is, if you play it enough times and loud enough and
8   isolate it, you will hear it.
9            This shows the defendant suggesting paying him
10   cash.  And it doesn't even matter whether that means a bag
11   of cash, or whether it means no financing; no, you know, a
12   lump sum.  It doesn't matter, because the point is, he is
13   trying to do it in a way that is not going to leave a paper
14   trail.  That's the whole point.
15            Cohen is basically telling him on this recording
16   that he's going to set up a shell corporation.  That he's
17   spoken with Allen Weisselberg, Trump's loyal CFO, about how
18   to do it.
19            This tape unequivocally shows a presidential
20   candidate actively engaging in a scheme to influence the
21   election by reimbursing AMI for killing the McDougal story.
22            And that's why they're so desperate to discredit
23   it.
24            So, now Cohen has gotten his approval from The
25   Boss.

1             Attempts by Cohen to reach Davidson.  Davidson
2   calls back and speaks with Cohen.
3             And then another rare call between Cohen and
4   Allen Weisselberg on October 25th.
5             Remember, there are six calls in three years
6   between these guys.  Well, two of them happened in the
7   three days leading up to the Stormy Daniels payoff.
8             The next morning, on October 26th, Cohen calls
9   Mr. Trump, and they speak for three minutes.
10             Cohen explained that he was seeking and got final
11   approval to fund the deal.
12             Another SureCall from Cohen to the Defendant at
13   8:34 a.m.
14             And the defense has tried to suggest -- I mean,
15   this is damming.  This is a half an hour before Cohen goes
16   across the street and initiates the paperwork that leads to
17   the wire transfer.  Half an hour before that, he is getting
18   the final go ahead from Donald Trump.
19             So, the defense has tried to suggest -- they
20   didn't say it on summation -- when they were
21   cross-examining Michael Cohen, they tried to say:  Well,
22   there were other things going on the day before, or a
23   couple days before, Tiffany Trump -- somebody was, you
24   know, trying to -- was looking into something on behalf of
25   Tiffany Trump, and you were so busy.  It was two weeks

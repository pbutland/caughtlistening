1 2017, and when the reimbursements were done, the payments
2 stopped.
3 But didn't Mr. Blanche say, well, Cohen did do
4 legal work in 2017.
5 He did a little bit of work for Donald Trump and
6 Melania Trump, something about Madame Tussauds' Wax Museum.
7 Yeah, he did.
8 The testimony was that he did less than ten hours
9 of legal work that year.
10 Cohen spent more time being crossâ€”examined at
11 this trial than he did doing legal work for Donald Trump in
12 2017.
13 And, based on everything that Mr. Trump has said
14 and done, do you think that there is any chance, any chance
15 that Trump would have paid $42,000 an hour for legal work by
16 Mr. Cohen?
17 That would be a pretty sweet hourly rate, if you
18 multiple that out, there are 52 weeks a year, 35 hours a
19 week, that would be over $1,250,000, that would be a pretty
20 good hourly rate.
21 The fact is that Cohen did pretty well here. He
22 got a cool title: Personal Attorney to the President.
23 And he used that title to get some very lucrative
24 consulting clients.
25 Nobody ever said he kept that a secret.

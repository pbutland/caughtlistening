Summation/Blanche

1            So, the point is, if you accept the Government's
2   position that there was this agreed-upon scheme in
3   January, why would Weisselberg say to Mr. McConney things
4   that end up not happening?
5            Why was it the Trump Org -- excuse me -- Trump
6   Trust documents paid the first three months if there was
7   this Agreement reached amongst President Trump, Michael
8   Cohen and Allen Weisselberg?
9            Now, also, you have these. Right? They're in
10   evidence.
11            Why are they in evidence?
12            If this is some document, some evidence of a
13   crime, how come, as you heard from Mr. McConney, he took
14   both of these documents and he put them in the record
15   where he keeps all the records for the Payroll Department
16   in his office?
17            He didn't get rid of them. He didn't try to
18   discard them.
19            This is a case about false filings, about false
20   business records.
21            And, yet, the supposed evidence of the false
22   filing were in the records of President Trump's personal
23   account, in the payroll cabinet of Mr. McConney's office.
24            Does that make sense?
25            So, for all those reasons, you don't have to go

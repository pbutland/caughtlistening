1   campaigns and suppress negative stories.
2            There's zero criminal intent in that 2015
3   meeting.
4            Indeed, Mr. Pecker told you that it was really
5   good business to work with President Trump.
6            He explained to you that the positive stories
7   actually started when President Trump started running
8   The Apprentice in the early Two Thousands.
9            As far back as 1988, Mr. Pecker told you that he
10   had helped suppress a story for Mr. Trump. 1988. That's
11   17 years ahead of the August 2015 meeting.
12            And, again, in 2007 -- so, eight years before the
13   August 2015 meeting -- Mr. Pecker told you he started to
14   work with Mr. Cohen to help President Trump.
15            So, this had been going on for decades. It
16   had been going on for eight years with Mr. Cohen and
17   Mr. Pecker.
18            And they were friends. No dispute about that.
19   Mr. Pecker said that a couple of times.
20            But, this was also not just about friendship.
21   This was good business for AMI. They made a lot of money
22   based on relationships. Not surprising.
23            And then, in 2015, when they had that meeting,
24   there is no doubt that one of the reasons why Mr. Pecker
25   agreed to it was that it was good for business.

Summation/Mr. Blanche
4569
1 President Trump for over two decades.
2 He told you that. He wrote it in his book.
3 And until the Summer of 2018, he was a fan. And
4 now he's not.
5 He went from loving President Trump and defending
6 him to outright hatred.
7 I'm going to play an audio that I played when he
8 was on the stand about what he really thinks.
9 Go ahead.
10 (Audiotape being played.)
11 **********
12 MR. BLANCHE: The next one.
13 (Audiotape being played.)
14 MR. BLANCHE: Now, of course, he never met Alvin
15 Bragg.
16 That was just another lie, by the way.
17 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
18 THE COURT: Overruled.
19 MR. BLANCHE: He testified in this trial that he
20 never met Alvin Bragg.
21 When he said that, that was a lie.
22 And Mr. Cohen, by the way, is making millions of
23 dollars off his hatred of Donald Trump. Millions of
24 dollars.
25 You saw this.

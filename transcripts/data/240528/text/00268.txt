2 January 1st of 2017 to January 5th of 2018, from any Trump

21 evidence, the 2018 General Ledgers for legal expenses.
22 And you can confirm that he wasn't paid a dime.
23 So, why, if he was still doing legal work, why
24 wasn't he paid a dime in 2018? Because he wasn't being paid
25 for legal work in either year. He was being reimbursed in

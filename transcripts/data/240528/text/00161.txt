Summation/Steinglass

1   friend, and at that dinner, your friend told you that he
2   was getting married. And you find the receipt a couple of
3   years later from that restaurant, and you're like: Oh,
4   yeah, that must have been the date such and such told me
5   he was getting married.
6            But, as it turns out, your friend was in
7   California that weekend, so it turns out you must be
8   wrong, and it must have been some other night you had
9   dinner with your friend and he told you he's getting
10   married.
11            That doesn't mean you're lying that you had
12   dinner with your friend or that he told you he was getting
13   married.
14            Cohen may be able to place a particular call by
15   looking at the phone records, the texts, the time, for
16   context about what was going on around that time; but the
17   story is, as he told you, the same story that he's been
18   telling for six years.
19            And here, too, the Defense is trying to have it
20   both ways.
21            They're telling you that Cohen will say anything
22   to get the Defendant convicted.
23            And then they're pointing out that his testimony,
24   if you accept it, isn't enough.
25            So, which is it?

1   that.  They were really just trying to negotiate a better
2   deal with a different magazine, In Touch.
3            But, it doesn't really matter whether it was The
4   Dirty, the Daily Mail, In Touch magazine, as it relates to
5   the charges in this case.  In 2011, Daniels' claims were
6   already public.  The public was aware of them.  So, again,

12   no money to be made.

21   Trump's campaign.  The election is in November and this is

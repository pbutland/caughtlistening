1   protect his wife from finding out about Stormy Daniels was
2   far less significant for him than his desire for winning
3   the 2016 election.
4            It's better to deal with it now in 2018,
5   regardless of Melania's feelings, than it would have been
6   to deal with it before the election.
7            Cohen testified that Mr. Trump told him to push
8   the Daniels deal out as long as possible, because if he
9   wins, it will have no relevance because he'll already be
10   President, and if he loses, he doesn't even care.
11            This is the Defendant, caring about the election,
12   not his family.
13            Mr. Pecker told you the same thing.
14            Once Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, it was
15   all about the election and not about Melania or the rest
16   of his family.
17            And Ms. Daniels told you back in 2006 and 2007,
18   the Defendant never asked her to keep their encounter a
19   secret. He invited her to Trump Vodka, showed her around,
20   and kissed her hello.
21            Mr. Trump didn't express any concern at all about
22   his family finding out.
23            He wasn't anxious to silence Stormy Daniels until
24   he became Candidate Trump.
25            Surely, after that Wall Street Journal article

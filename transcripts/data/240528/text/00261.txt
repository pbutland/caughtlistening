Summation/Mr. Steinglass

3   preceding page.)
4            MR. STEINGLASS:  (Continuing.)
5            (ADA Steinglass laughs.)  This is -- these
6   documents are so damming that you almost have to laugh by
7   the way Mr. Blanche tried to explain them to you, that this
8   wasn't fraud -- these weren't false business records,
9   because if they were, they would have destroyed it, okay.
10            So, let me see if I follow that logic.  So, they
11   would have destroyed evidence, committed another crime, to
12   hide this crime, but because they didn't do that, and these
13   documents actually exist, that's evidence that a crime
14   wasn't committed?
15            If that's true, you could never prosecute a false
16   business records claim because the existence of the false
17   business records in the first place would prove that there
18   was no intent to defraud.
19            Doesn't that seem a little circular to you?
20            So, McConney staples these two documents together
21   and puts them in his payroll book, which he kept in a locked
22   drawer in his office.
23            And so, now The Trump Organization has two sets of
24   books, one that McConney keeps locked up in his office and
25   the other that goes into the General Ledgers for the outside

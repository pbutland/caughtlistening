1             And together, if you remember, Cohen and Hicks,
2   concoct this denial, blaming the liberal media and the
3   Clinton machine for the McDougal story.
4             Now, Hicks was playing it straight.  She
5   testified, I submit, credibly that she had never heard the
6   name Karen McDougal.
7             Cohen was very familiar with the name, but he
8   slid seamlessly in to lie-on-behalf-of-Mr. Trump mode.
9             And Hicks also testified that she ran the
10   potential statement, this potential statement by the
11   Defendant, but Mr. Trump insisted on drafting his own
12   statement, complete with a denial of both the affair and
13   that he knew anything about the AMI deal.
14             But now you know that that was a total
15   fabrication, that is the statement that this Defendant put
16   out on October 4th after The Wall Street Journal article
17   was a lie.  It was a lie because he said he didn't know
18   anything about the Karen McDougal deal, but he did because
19   he is on tape from two months earlier talking about it.
20             And if you remember that Pecker testified that
21   the Defendant called him when he was in New Jersey with his
22   investors back in June to talk about it.
23             Why?  Why did Mr. Trump lie about that?  Why?
24             Back to this crazy flurry of events.
25             Davidson called Howard.  Hicks calls Cohen.  This

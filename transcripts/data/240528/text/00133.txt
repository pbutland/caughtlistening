Proceedings
4588
1 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, the proposed curative
2 instruction is fine with us, your Honor. We have no
3 objection to that.
4 As to the Retainer Agreement, we very much believe
5 that we have not misstated the law.
6 And we very much believe that if the Court is
7 considering giving this instruction, that we be allowed to
8 brief that this evening because there is —— besides the fact
9 that there were no questions put to the witnesses about
10 their understanding, the cases that the People put forward
11 don't stand for the proposition that they want this Retainer
12 Agreement instruction to state.
13 And we continue to object to it.
14 And if the Court is considering it —— by the way,
15 our arguments were that the witnesses testified, which they
16 did testify, about their understanding.
17 And they are lawyers that were testifying about
18 their understanding.
19 And so, we very much object to the Retainer
20 Agreement instruction.
21 And if the Court is considering it, we would
22 respectfully request permission to put in a more substantive
23 response tonight.
24 THE COURT: All right.
25 I have reviewed both of your proposed instructions.

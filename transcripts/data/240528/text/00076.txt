2   sounds a lot more criminal if there is a big duffle bag

12            There is no scenario under which there has been
13   any testimony in this trial that President Trump was going
14   to walk around with a duffle bag filled of $150,000 in

20   phone call comes in.  That is what Mr. Cohen tells you.
21   And the last thing -- few things you hear on the recording
22   and on the transcript is, you hear somebody say "check."
23   But it's not the end of a sentence.  It's the beginning of
24   a sentence.

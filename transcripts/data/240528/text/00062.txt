1            I want to talk now about Ms. McDougal.
2            That's the second catch and kill; right.
3            Now, Ms. McDougal didn't testify at this trial,
4   but you heard about her affair.
5            Again, just like Mr. Sajudin, there was never any
6   money paid by Michael Cohen or President Trump to AMI for
7   anything involving Ms. McDougal's story.
8            But, what is clear from what you heard about
9   Ms. McDougal, this was not a catch and kill, either.
10            Everybody said the same thing. Karen McDougal did
11   not want her story published.
12            Catch and kill:  We're going to catch a story
13   from being published, to keep it from being published, and
14   then we're going to kill it.
15            Ms. McDougal didn't want her story published.
16            She wanted to kick-start her career.  She wanted
17   to be on the covers of magazines. She wanted to write
18   articles.
19            She didn't want to publish the story.
20            She wanted to write articles with AMI.
21            And, again, she did that.
22            Again, how is that a catch and kill?  It's not.
23            So -- and her attorney said the same thing.
24            It wasn't one side.
25            He told you, Mr. Davidson said she did not want

1   absence of a phone record does not mean that a conversation
2   did not take place.
3             At the same time, Davidson texts Howard, I can't
4   believe Cohen let this go.  It's going to be a shit show.
5             And Davidson is pretty much out of the deal at
6   this point, but he tells Howard that he hears that
7   Rodriguez and Daniels had struck an alternate deal, and
8   Howard is in disbelief.
9             He said:  All because Trump is tight.
10             And there is a lot of phone activity over the
11   next few days.  We won't show it all.
12             Howard and Rodriguez.  Howard and Davidson.
13   Howard and Rodriguez.  Howard and Cohen.
14             And then on October 23rd, a rare call from Allen
15   Weisselberg, and on a Sunday no less.
16             Cohen explained that Weisselberg left a voicemail
17   regarding funding for the Daniels NDA.
18             And when I say, rare, I am talking that these
19   guys have like six phone calls in like three years.
20             The next day, on October 24th, there is an
21   encrypted call between Cohen and Pecker at 4:32 p.m.
22             And then you have this Keith Schiller call that
23   we have already discussed.  It's actually a call from
24   Schiller in the middle of that text exchange.  The call
25   goes to voicemail, but Cohen calls back a minute later.

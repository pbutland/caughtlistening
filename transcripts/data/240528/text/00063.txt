1   to publish her article.
2            You can see it on the screen:
3            "Ms. McDougal did not want to publish an article
4   about the claims that have been discussed here; right?"
5            "True."
6            You can see, one of her friends forced her hands,
7   the friend that publicized Ms. McDougal's allegations, so
8   she was trying to take advantage of the situation.
9            To be clear, it was not Ms. McDougal's intention
10   to publish her story.
11            And, again, the reason why this matters, the
12   reason why the details of what happened back in 2016
13   matter to you and should matter to you is that there was
14   never any risk that her allegation would influence the
15   election, because she didn't want her allegations
16   published.
17            Remember why you're thinking about these
18   incidents. It's because the Government has alleged a
19   conspiracy to influence the election. And the second of
20   the three didn't want to influence the election at all.
21   She didn't want her story published.
22            So, she was paid $150,000. No question about
23   that. You saw the documents, and you heard the testimony.
24            But, remember why.
25            Ms. McDougal had an entourage around her.

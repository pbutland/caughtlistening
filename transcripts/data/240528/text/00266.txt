Summation/Mr. Steinglass

3            MR. STEINGLASS:  So there is no Retainer Agreement
4   for him to consult.
5            So, McConney reminds him, it's $35,000 a month.
6            And about an hour later, Cohen sends an email to
7   McConney, with an invoice billing $35,000 each for the
8   months of January and February.
9            And the invoice says, "Pursuant to the Retainer
10   Agreement.  Kindly remit payment for services rendered."
11            But there was no Retainer Agreement.  And it was
12   not for services rendered.
13            Now, the Defense has tried to suggest, still,
14   remarkably, that these payments really were compensation for
15   legal work that Mr. Cohen was doing in 2017.
16            And in his opening Mr. Blanche told you, quote,

18   35,000 a month was not a pay back to Mr. Cohen for the money
19   he gave to Ms. Daniels."
20            By now, having seen Exhibits 35 and 36, you have to
21   know that that argument is nonsense.
22            The Defense argues that there is an email from
23   Weisselberg to Cohen at the end of January 2017 asking him
24   to prepare the Agreement that we discussed.
25            They say, AHA, that's proof that there really was a

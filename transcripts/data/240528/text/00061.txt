Summation/Blanche

1   on cross he says another.
2            He is not telling the truth. He's lying.
3            So, Mr. Cohen, by the way, used "credit"
4   constantly; right.
5            He constantly said to you he wanted credit. He
6   wanted credit from President Trump. He did something
7   because he wanted credit. He kept President Trump updated
8   because he wanted to take credit for himself.
9            He told you that repeatedly on direct and, also,
10   on cross.
11            Why do you think he did that?
12            That's the same phrase that Hope Hicks used in
13   describing Mr. Cohen.
14            She described Mr. Cohen as being "Somebody who
15   always wanted credit".
16            Mr. Cohen admitted to you that he was following
17   this trial before he testified.
18            Just think about that for a minute.
19            He came in here and testified two weeks ago, but
20   admitted, because he had to, that he had been following
21   the trial earlier in the trial.
22            Why do you think, suddenly, "credit" was part of
23   his story?
24            Is that something that can be trusted as the
25   truth?  Absolutely not.

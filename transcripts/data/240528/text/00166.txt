Summation/Steinglass
4621
1 And, under our law, the judge will explain to you
2 that you cannot convict Mr. Cohen —— you cannot convict
3 the Defendant on Mr. Cohen's word alone, unless it's
4 corroborated by other evidence in this case, evidence that
5 tends to connect the Defendant with the commission of this
6 crime.
7 That's not much of a hurdle because in this case
8 there is, literally, a mountain of evidence of
9 corroborating testimony that tends to connect the
10 Defendant to this crime: from Pecker, to Hicks, to the
11 Defendant's own employees, to the documents, to the
12 Defendant's own Tweets, and rallies, and his own words on
13 that recorded conversation. The list goes on and on.
14 It's difficult to conceive of a case with more
15 corroboration than this one.
16 You don‘t need to waste any time thinking about
17 this one.
18 So, eventually, Cohen came to the realization
19 that with Mr. Trump, loyalty was not a two—way street. And
20 it became clear that attorney Robert Costello, the
21 ostensible back channel to Mr. Trump, was actually a
22 double agent, there to discourage Cohen from cooperating
23 and to keep the Defendant informed.
24 And it became clear to Cohen that they were
25 setting him up to be the fall guy.

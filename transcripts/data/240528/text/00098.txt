1   stories and issues that came up during the 2016 campaign.
2   It was not a doomsday event.
3             President Trump, as you saw, addressed it in a
4   video that was addressed to the -- released to the American
5   public.  He addressed it in a debate a couple days later.
6   He never thought that it was going to cost him to lose the
7   campaign and, indeed, it didn't.
8             So, Michael Cohen, however, had a different view.
9             Michael Cohen told you that he realized it was
10   catastrophic, and he wanted to do something about it, and
11   that's exactly what he did.
12             With respect to Ms. Daniels -- so, by the way,
13   Ms. Daniels told you that she did not testify in the Grand
14   Jury in this case.
15             Why did they call her as a witness at trial?
16             There was no dispute that there was an NDA
17   signed.  There was no dispute that the charges have to do
18   with filings, The Trump Organization, the personal records
19   of President Trump in 2017, something that Ms. Daniels knew
20   nothing about.
21             So, why?
22             I will tell you why.  They did it to try to
23   inflame your emotions.  They did it to try to embarrass
24   President Trump.
25             MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.

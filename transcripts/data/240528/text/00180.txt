Summation/Steinglass
4635
1 The Amendment said, "Payment due five days after
2 the signing of this contract."
3 They knew the story wasn't true.
4 And when asked, "Why are you paying $30,000 for
5 an untrue story," Pecker said —— this is from his
6 testimony on direct: "Because if the story got out to
7 another publication, it would have been very embarrassing
8 to the campaign."
9 This is not a normal, legitimate press function;
10 and it also did not make its way to Mr. Blanche's
11 summation when he was telling you, "This is not really
12 catch and kill."
13 This was really catch and kill.
14 This whole nonsense about the fiduciary duty is
15 out the window here.
16 The only reason to kill a bogus story, the only
17 reason, that's not in service of AMI's investigators,
18 that's in service of the Defendant's campaign.
19 On December 15th, someone at The Trump
20 Organization, we don't know who —— we could make some
21 reasonable inferences here —— called Cohen on his cell,
22 and they spoke for nearly six minutes.
23 The following day, Cohen called Howard.
24 And the day after that, on December 17, 2015, AMI
25 and Dino Sajudin signed the Amendment to the Source

Summation — Defense/Blanche
4558
1 By late 2017, Cohen had been called to testify
2 before Congress, as you recall, regarding, amongst other
3 things, these issues. And at the beginning of the
4 recording, you actually hear Mr. Cohen talk about how he
5 had referred Mr. Davidson to one of President Trump's
6 lawyers, Jay Sekulow.
7 So, of course, they discussed the payment, of
8 course they did, but that doesn't change the lack of
9 evidence about what President Trump knew in 2016. The
10 evidence of that is from one man, Michael Cohen.
11 Remember, Mr. Costello testified last week. He
12 told you exactly the same thing. He told you that when he
13 first met with Mr. Cohen again in 2018, in April, Mr. Cohen
14 told him that President Trump did not know about the
15 payments when they were made in 2016.
16 And remember when this happened in Michael
17 Cohen's life, okay. Federal agents had searched his house,
18 searched his hotel room, searched his safe deposit box. He
19 was under extreme stress.
20 Mr. Costello said he mentioned suicide at the
21 time; and Costello told Mr. Cohen the best way out of the
22 situation, the best way for him not to be under stress was
23 to provide information to the Feds. And Mr. Costello
24 explained to him that that was the way that he could get
25 leniency and not go to jail.

Summation/Mr. Blanche

1 They are signed by Eric. They are signed by Eric
2 Trump and Mr. Weisselberg. Not by President Trump.
3 But, as you know, President Trump signed the
4 remaining checks at the beginning of April 2017.
5 There is an example on the screen to remind you of
6 what they looked like.
7 Now, these checks don't have any of the language,
8 you will see, from the invoice Mr. Cohen sent. They just
9 say retainer.
10 And as you remember from Mr. McConney and
11 Ms. Tarasoff, that was just a generated word from what was
12 put into the voucher.
13 There is nothing sinister or criminal about that
14 word.
15 It's just generated when the check is printed after
16 that information is put in the voucher, not by President
17 Trump, not by Allen Weisselberg, by Deb Tarasoff.
18 So, you shouldn't think that the word "retainer"
19 specifies or differentiates between any reason for the
20 payment.
21 It's just a single word. It's just a word that,
22 again, was generated by the MDS system.
23 Now, there was a lot of evidence and in openings
24 there was a lot of talk about how President Trump signed all
25 of these checks beginning in April of 2017.

2 Cohen was drawn to the Defendant like a moth to
3 the flame.
4 And he wasn't the only one.
5 Think about David Pecker for a minute. Look what
6 the Defendant did to David Pecker.
7 Pecker saw Donald Trump as a mentor.
8 Donald Trump saw David Pecker as a useful tool, a
9 means to an end.
10 That's why, if you remember, Mr. Pecker
11 testified, suddenly, after Mr. Trump announced his
12 candidacy, contact between them increased dramatically.
13 Mr. Trump not only corrupted those around him,
14 but he got them to lie to cover it up: Stay on message or
15 you're out.
16 Remember, like Cohen, Pecker also issued a false
17 denial after The Wall Street Journal broke the Karen
18 McDougal story on November 4th. He falsely claimed that
19 the deal was all about the context.
20 And he admitted to you that he issued that denial
21 for the same reason that he purchased Karen McDougal's
22 story in the first place, to protect the campaign.
23 The judge will tell you that Mr. Cohen is an
24 accomplice because he participated in crimes based on
25 conduct alleged in this case.

2                Second, remember, the lawyers are not witnesses in
3       this case.
4                So if the lawyers assert as fact something that's
5       not based on the evidence, you must disregard it.
6                 Remember, nothing the lawyers say at any time is
7       evidence, so nothing the lawyers say in their summations is
8       evidence.
9                You have heard the evidence.  And you must decide
10       this case on the evidence as you find it and the law as I
11       explain it.
12                Third, during the summations, one lawyer's
13       recollection of the evidence may in good faith differ from
14       the recollection of the other lawyer or from your own
15       recollection.
16                And the lawyers will undoubtedly differ with each
17       other on the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.

19       evaluation of the evidence, however, that controls,
20       regardless of what the lawyers have said or will say about
21       the evidence.
22                Again, you and you alone are the judges of the
23       facts in this case.
24                If, during your deliberations, you need to have
25       your recollection of the testimony refreshed, you may have

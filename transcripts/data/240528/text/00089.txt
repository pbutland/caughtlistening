1 She was just working with Mr. Davidson, with Ms.
2 Rodriguez and with Dylan Howard to try to get money from

4 Now —— and, again, keep in mind that just like
5 Ms. McDougal when Ms. Daniels got paid, she didn't even

7 Rodriguez and Davidson kept a big chunk of that
8 money, 25 percent of the $130,000 that she was paid, so
9 $24,000.
10 And then what happened in 2018?
11 So, we are fast—forwarding a little bit. What
12 happened that made Ms. Daniels want to go public with her
13 story?

16 Mr. Davidson told you during his testimony that

19 false accusations public.

22 March of 2018. We will play that now.
23 (Whereupon, an audio recording is played in
24 open court.)
25 MR. BLANCHE: Mr. Davidson called —— I am sorry.

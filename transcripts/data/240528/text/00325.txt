Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1   Pecker had that relatively long conversations.
2            And then at 9:12 a.m. on October 13th, Pecker and
3   Cohen speak via the encrypted app.
4            And 11 minutes later, Cohen emails First Republic
5   from the 26th copyright pantry, right outside Rhona's
6   office, the one that she uses, and she sits right outside
7   Mr. Trump's office.
8            Is this timing all coincidence, every single one
9   of these things?
10            Mr. Donald Trump is being kept abreast of every
11   development.
12            On October 17th, at 4:31 p.m., Davidson pulls out
13   of the Daniels NDA.
14            Around 20 minutes later, Cohen talks to Davidson
15   to try to get the deal back on track.
16            Eight minutes after that, Cohen tries to call the
17   defendant to give him the update.  That Daniels has now
18   declared the NDA void.
19            And Cohen explained that he left a voicemail.
20            And the following morning, Melania Trump texts
21   Cohen to call Mr. Trump on his cell, and Cohen responds,
22   "Of course."
23            And Cohen believes that they spoke that day, on
24   October 18th.
25            Look, of course, is it possible to know exactly

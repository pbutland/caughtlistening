3 On June 16th, Howard texts Cohen about the date
4 for the upcoming meeting between Howard and McDougal.
5 And within 40 minutes of that, Cohen is texting
6 Keith Schiller to get in touch with Mr. Trump.
7 And within seconds of that exchange, Cohen speaks
8 with Mr. Trump directly. Not even through Schiller.
9 Cohen testified that he informed Mr. Trump about
10 the situation. He always reported developments like this
11 to Mr. Trump, or it could cost him his job.
12 Like nearly all of what Cohen testified to, his
13 testimony is corroborated by other evidence.
14 You will recall that Pecker testified that after
15 that meeting took place, Mr. Trump personally called Pecker
16 to discuss the McDougal matter. And he explained that the
17 defendant told him that he had spoken to Michael, and that
18 Michael had told him about Karen.
19 So that's corroboration that Michael Cohen is
20 keeping Mr. Trump informed at every step.
21 They went on to discuss, that is, Pecker and Trump
22 when on to discuss whether the defendant should buy the
23 story.
24 And Mr. Trump says, he'll think about it, and
25 he'll have Michael Cohen call you back in a few days with

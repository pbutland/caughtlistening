1   you."
2            But what did Mr. Cohen claim happened in that
3   conversation?  He didn't think it was good enough to say
4   that President Trump doesn't buy stories.
5            So, this is what he said about that call.  He told
6   you President Trump told Mr. Pecker:  No problem, I will
7   take care of it.  So that is a big difference; Mr. Pecker
8   telling you that President Trump said, "I don't buy
9   stories," and Mr. Cohen coming in and saying, "No problem,
10   I will take care of it."
11            And which one is true?
12            You know that The Trump Organization, President
13   Trump, Michael Cohen, never paid Mr. Pecker a penny for the
14   McDougal story.  There is no dispute about that.
15            Now, let's talk about another lie.  Remember when
16   Cohen testified about a lunch that he supposedly had with
17   David Pecker, and the Government -- the Government said,
18   "Directing your attention to September of 2016, did you
19   have lunch with Mr. Pecker when he presented to you --
20   pressed you further?"
21            Again, this is when Mr. Cohen was saying that Mr.
22   Pecker was really frustrated that he had not been paid for
23   the McDougal story.  They have lunch.
24            Tell us a little bit about the lunch.
25            We went to his favorite Italian restaurant.

Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1            What possible incentive would Cohen have to not
2   tell Trump what he did for him?
3            On November 4, 2016, as you know, the Wall Street
4   Journal broke the McDougal story, and once again Schiller
5   reaches out to Cohen to see if he could take a call.
6            And Cohen also speak with Davidson.
7            He explained that he was trying to insure that
8   McDougal wasn't going rouge.
9            And, then, once again, at 9:06 p.m., Cohen speaks
10   with Mr. Trump for nearly six minutes on Mr. Schiller's
11   phone.  Trump was upset that this would negatively impact
12   his standing with female voters.
13            I know what you are thinking, how do we know that
14   this was really Cohen speaking to Trump and not to
15   Schiller.
16            Well, you need to look at the context, what was
17   going on at the time.  Remember that insane flurry of
18   activity that I went through before, I'm not going to go
19   through it again, on November 4th, everyone calling
20   everyone and their mother.
21            It's crazy to think that in the middle of that
22   flurry about this article, that Cohen would have a casual
23   conversations with Schiller in the middle of that media
24   monsoon.
25            And Cohen explained that he detailed for Mr. Trump

1   anything you have learned about Donald Trump during this
2   trial that makes you think that he would pay twice what he
3   owes someone?
4             But it was worth it.  It was worth it to hide the
5   truth about what this money was really for, a reimbursement
6   for the Daniels payoff.
7             Back at People's 36, McConney wrote down -- if
8   you remember, he wrote down the wrong bonus amount.  When
9   he added it all up, he got $410,000.
10             Weisselberg looked at the pad and said, no, use
11   420,000 divided by 12.
12             And the Defendant and Weisselberg agreed to pay
13   Cohen out in monthly installments so they could pretend it
14   was a monthly retainer.  That's 35,000 a month, effective
15   2/1/17.
16             And it also says:  Wire monthly from DJT.
17   Meaning the DJT Entity accounts.
18             McConney told you that that was the account that
19   they used to wire money from the Defendant.
20             And Donald Trump, DJT, was the MDS software code
21   that was used for that particular account.
22             And then below the line, again, this is
23   McConney's note pad that he is writing down as Weisselberg
24   is talking:  Start 35,000 a month in January 2017.  Mike to
25   invoice us.

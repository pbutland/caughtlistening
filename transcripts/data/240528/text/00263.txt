Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1 more taxes are getting paid than are owed.
2 But, as the Judge will tell you, it's a crime to
3 prepare false tax documents, regardless, even when doing so
4 does not result in underpayment of taxes.
5 And preparing these false tax documents is yet
6 another unlawful means that the defendant and his cohorts
7 were willing to engage in to conceal their election
8 conspiracy.
9 On February 6th, 2017, McConney sends an email with
10 the subject line: "Dollar sign. Dollar sign." Reminding
11 Cohen to send over the invoices that Cohen spoke to Allen
12 about.
13 Two days later, Cohen met with President Trump at
14 the White House in the Oval Office.
15 And the President asked if he was okay, if he
16 needed money?
17 And Cohen said, he was all good.
18 And then President Trump told Cohen to make sure to
19 deal with Allen, and that the January and February checks
20 would be forthcoming.
21 Not a detailed conversation, but enough to reassure
22 Cohen that the plan to reimburse him was moving forward.
23 This is his testimony:
24 "QUESTION: Did you discuss in the Oval Office the
25 reimbursement payments that were going to be made to you?"

Summation/Mr. Blanche
4576
1 It worked!
2 She was successful. She did not want her story
3 published.
4 That's not catch—and—kill.
5 And with the Ms. Daniels story, again, the story
6 was already public. The story was already public.
7 Now, the ninth one —— the ninth reason that you
8 should have reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is the
9 manipulation of evidence.
10 Now, there are a lot of documents and a lot of
11 records that you have seen in this case.
12 And those documents, those records, that testimony,
13 Mr. Steinglass is going to talk to you about this afternoon,
14 about why the Government believes that they proved guilt
15 beyond a reasonable doubt.
16 But, they have made mistakes in this trial in the
17 way that they presented the evidence.
18 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
19 THE COURT: Overruled.
20 MR. BLANCHE: And we have caught them.
21 First, there is the text message that I talked
22 about a few minutes ago from President Trump's wife to
23 Michael Cohen, saying "call me" and no evidence of a phone
24 call.
25 Second, the October 24th, 8:02 phone call.

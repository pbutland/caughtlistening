Summation/Mr. Blanche
4540
1   to help extort people by threatening to release a private
2   audio, a private video, if the person that they're
3   targeting doesn't give them money.  You heard that he did
4   this with multiple people over the years; Lindsay Lohan,
5   Charlie Sheen, and others.
6            And, you know, by the way, that Mr. Cohen admitted
7   that Davidson -- Mr. Davidson and this crew, including
8   Daniels, were trying to extort President Trump.  Mr.
9   Davidson made it clear to you that when he was talking to
10   Cohen about the fact that Daniels wanted money, plain and
11   simple, she was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage
12   to get paid.
13            We're going to play just a portion of that
14   recording that you heard.
15            (Whereupon, an audio recording played in open
16   court.)
17            MR. BLANCHE:  What you just heard is most
18   certainly not President Trump or Michael Cohen trying to
19   influence an election.
20            What you just heard was Mr. Davidson talking about
21   Stormy Daniels, trying to make sure she got paid.
22            MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
23            THE COURT:  Sustained.
24            Counselor, is this a good time to take a break?
25            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.

Summation/Mr. Steinglass

1   gratitude for everything that AMI had done to get him
2   elected.
3            In January of 2017, Mr. Cohen was upset about the
4   fact that his bonus had been cut, despite his efforts on
5   his boss's behalf, and about the fact that he still hadn't
6   been paid back.
7            So on January 16th or 17th, Cohen and Weisselberg
8   discussed how Mr. Trump could repay Cohen without being too
9   obvious about it.  We have already reviewed the infamous
10   bank statement.  The smoking gun with both Cohen and
11   Weisselberg's notes.
12            And after Cohen and Weisselberg from worked out
13   the amount of the payment, but not the repayment schedule,
14   they went into Mr. Trump's office to speak to him.
15            Weisselberg certainly didn't have the authority to
16   approve that kind of money, and he couldn't approve a bonus
17   at all.  And he certainly couldn't approve one nickle from
18   the DJT account.
19            And Cohen explained that in this meeting with
20   Trump, Weisselberg said, "We're going to pay you over 12
21   months."
22            And saying it that way, that made Cohen believe
23   that Weisselberg and Donald Trump had already discussed the
24   repayment schedule.  They were running like a frick and
25   frack routine.

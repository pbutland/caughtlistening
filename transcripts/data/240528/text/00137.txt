Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4592
1   summaries were trimmed down to somehow mislead you.
2            The call summaries are intended as a guide for you
3   to look at some of the relevant calls in the New York time
4   zone.
5            But the calls themselves, the phone records
6   themselves are all in evidence, and so you can look through
7   them at your leisure if you so choose.
8            The Defense also can point you to any call that
9   they want you to look at; and, in fact, they did so.
10            So, there is nothing sinister here, no
11   manipulation.
12            And that's an interesting accusation coming from
13   the Defense, who created a phone summary of calls between
14   Mr. Costello and Mr. Cohen and double counted half the
15   calls.
16            I mean, you have to go back and look at that. Look
17   at how many calls were actually made to the two of them.
18   They count the landline calls that may have been with
19   Cohen's friend, Mr. Citron.  So that's -- you should keep
20   that in mind when you are analyzing that evidence.
21            And, nor should you accept the Defense's argument
22   that we somehow hid evidence by selecting texts to create
23   exhibits.
24            The Defense was provided with the entire forensic
25   image of both of Mr. Cohen's phones.

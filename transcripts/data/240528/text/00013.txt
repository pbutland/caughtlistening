Summation/Mr. Blanche
4468
1 These invoices, as you all know and remember, were
2 prepared and sent by Michael Cohen and then the accounting
3 staff at Trump Tower just put the stamp, the stamp on them,
4 as you see on the screen there.
5 Then there were vouchers.
6 And the vouchers, as you know, were prepared by
7 Ms. Tarasoff, who testified.
8 She told you that she and Jeff McConney used a
9 system called MDS.
10 Do you remember that Monday when both of them
11 testified and they talked about the accounting software that
12 The Trump Organization used called "MDS."
13 And the vouchers, the information that was put in
14 those vouchers were a result of what the invoices said;
15 right.
16 Do you remember she told you that?
17 That she saw the invoice from Mr. Cohen, and based
18 upon what she saw in that invoice, that's exactly how she
19 knew what to put on the voucher.
20 It also was consistent with what she understood was
21 happening at that time, which is that Michael Cohen was
22 serving as President Trump's Personal Attorney, which was
23 true.
24 There is not even a dispute about that.
25 And then —— and then the checks; right.

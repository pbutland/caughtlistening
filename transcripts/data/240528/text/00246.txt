Summations — People/Steinglass

1 hoodwink the American voter made the difference in the 2016
2 election, but that's not something we have to prove.
3 The point is that the reimbursement to Cohen was
4 cloaked in false business records to hide the conspiracy;
5 the conspiracy to promote or prevent the election, whether
6 or not that conspiracy actually succeeded in tipping the
7 scale.
8 Is this a good time, right about now?
9 THE COURT: Yes.
10 All right.
11 Jurors, we are going to take a short break.
12 Before we do, I want to thank all of you for the
13 efforts you made to be flexible today, as you made
14 childcare arrangements and other arrangements to be certain
15 you could be with us as late as necessary. We will try to
16 figure this out as we go.
17 I didn't want you to go into your break without
18 knowing that I really do appreciate it.
19 Thank you.
20 COURT OFFICER: All rise.
21 (Whereupon, the jurors exit the courtroom.)
22 THE COURT: Please be seated.
23 I was watching the jurors. They look pretty
24 alert to me. I don't think we are losing anyone.
25 I think right now, we will try to finish it out

Summation - Defense/Blanche
4561
1             So, the fact of the matter is, as it relates to
2   Ms. Daniels and what President Trump knew in 2016, you only
3   know from one source, and I said that a few times, but it
4   matters, and that's Michael Cohen.
5             So, what do they do?
6             The Government knows that.  They know who they
7   are calling and what they are going to say.  They prepped
8   the witnesses, and there is nothing wrong with that.
9             So, what did they do to try to prop Michael Cohen
10   up, to try to prop his testimony up?
11             They showed him phone records, and they showed
12   him calls between him and others to help his testimony seem
13   more corroborative and more credible.
14             But, we all know how that happened, how that
15   ended.
16             You remember when we went through the calls from
17   October 24th, 2016?
18             He testified, both on direct and to me, that the
19   purpose of that call was to update President Trump about
20   the Daniels situation.  This is two days before the
21   Agreement is signed.  This is right at the most key part of
22   the negotiation, when Mr. Cohen is going to go -- he is
23   going to open up an account.  He is going to get the LLC,
24   and he is going to fund it with his HELOC.  It's all
25   happening.

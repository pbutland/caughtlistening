1   before we go to Trump's people."
2            The very next day, AMI enters into a Source
3   Agreement with Dino Sajudin.
4            The original Agreement, as you know, contained a
5   three-month exclusivity period and a $30,000 payment that
6   was not due until the story was published.
7            And Pecker testified that he was willing to pay
8   far more for this story than the National Enquirer
9   typically would because of the potential embarrassment the
10   story would have to the campaign. National Enquirer
11   doesn't pay $30,000 for a story like that.
12            And, this is rumor and innuendo. And, as you
13   know, it turned out to be not true.
14            But, Pecker told you -- and this is kind of
15   interesting because some of the things said on summation
16   are just not accurate.
17            Pecker told you that if the story were true, it
18   would have been the biggest story since the death of
19   Elvis; there would be no way to justify outright killing a
20   story like that. So, Pecker told you that he would have
21   published it, but, even then, he would have waited until
22   after the election because that's what he discussed with
23   Cohen and that's what he, Cohen, and the Defendant had
24   agreed to back in August.

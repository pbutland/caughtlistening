1   that. Literally, a made-up story, designed to harm
2   President Trump. Not true. And also harm his employees and
3   folks that work for him.
4            This happened -- this bubbled up a few months
5   after the August 2015 meeting. Right?
6            We're still in 2015.
7            And what did Mr. Pecker tell you about when he
8   learned about this?
9            He said that he was always going to do what was
10   best for AMI, and that if this story was true, he was
11   publishing it. He said it would have been the biggest
12   story AMI had ever had. He estimated he could have sold
13   ten million National Enquirers and that he had a fiduciary
14   obligation to his shareholders to sell the story.
15            That doesn't sound like a catch and kill at all.
16            Now, Pecker told you he never discussed the story
17   directly with President Trump, he just talked to Mr. Cohen
18   about it, and that makes good sense.
19            Remember, he told you that he was trying to
20   figure out what was true.
21            If it was true, he was going to publish it. So,
22   he wasn't talking to President Trump about it.
23            This isn't a catch and kill.
24            This is an opportunity. The biggest story we ever
25   had. Ten million copies. It was worth too much to catch

Summation/Mr. Steinglass
4812
1   People of the State of New York, I ask you to find the
2   Defendant guilty.
3            Thank you.
4            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Steinglass.
5            Jurors, thank you again for your patience.
6            What normally happens next is that you would hear
7   my instructions on the law.
8            That will not happen tonight.  That will happen
9   tomorrow morning.
10            I expect those instructions will take about an
11   hour.  Give or take.
12            And then you will receive the case to begin your
13   deliberations.
14            It has been a long day.  We worked pretty late, so
15   we will get started tomorrow at 10:00.
16            Before I excuse you, though, even though you've --
17   both sides have rested, you have heard both side's
18   summations, my admonitions continue to apply, even with more
19   force and effect now than before, because you have not yet
20   heard my instructions and you have not yet begun your
21   deliberations.
22            I remind you, please, to not talk either among
23   yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the
24   case.
25            Please continue to keep an open mind.

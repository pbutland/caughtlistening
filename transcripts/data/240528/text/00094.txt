Summation — Defense/Blanche

1 He was wrong. Pecker told you as much. He
2 didn't want anything to do with the Stormy Daniels
3 allegation. You can see that in the October 9th text that
4 you have on the screen, and he testified about that.
5 So, again, we are here talking about a conspiracy
6 between Mr. Pecker, President Trump and Michael Cohen to
7 catch and kill stories.
8 The Dino story, completely not true, never ran.
9 Ms. McDougal didn't want her story out, just
10 wanted to get back in the magazine business and write some
11 articles, which worked.
12 You heard Mr. Cohen say that she was on the front
13 cover of a magazine, Men's Health, and they sold more
14 copies than they had ever sold in the past.
15 That's not catch and kill here.
16 And you have Ms. Daniels coming forward right off
17 the Access Hollywood interview. This is our chance, now we
18 can really make your conspiracy work, the catch and kill
19 scheme. This is it.
20 And David Pecker is like, nah, I want nothing to
21 do with it.
22 That's our conspiracy?
23 That's the three catch and kills?
24 I want nothing to do with it. I am not buying
25 that story.

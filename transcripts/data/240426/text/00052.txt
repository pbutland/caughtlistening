1   document yesterday?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And I think you said that this is an invoice from Keith
4   Davidson; right?
5       A    I did.
6       Q    This is actually AMI's record relating to the invoice;
7   correct?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And so it's not the invoice itself?
10       A    It's an AMI record as you said; that's correct.
11       Q    Reflecting whatever Mr. Davidson's invoice said;
12   right?
13       A    Yes, that's correct.
14       Q    And AMI had employees who created a record like this
15   when it got an invoice; right?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    And as far as you understood it, the standard operating
18   procedure was for the employee to take the information from the
19   invoice and put it in the system?
20       A    That is correct.
21                 MR. BOVE:  And, Mr. Bernik, if we could zoom in on
22        the bottom row, please.

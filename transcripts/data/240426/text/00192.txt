1       A    Correct.

7       Q    You saw this before; correct?
8       A    FedEx label. Yes, Federal Express.
9       Q    That was a FedEx label that you had requested?

15       I don't know why she requested it.
16       Q    Okay.
17       Were you involved at all in sending checks down to the

19       A    No, I was not.
20       Q    Okay.
21       But, when you were President Trump's assistant, one of the
22   things that he would do was sign checks; right?
23       A    Yes. Of course. Yes.
24       Q    And am I correct that when he would sign checks, he
25   was often multitasking?

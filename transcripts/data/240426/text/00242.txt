G. Farro - Direct/Mangold
Page 1572
1       A    Yes, I do.
2       Q    How did that come about?
3       A    Well, when Mr. Cohen called me, I was on a golf course,
4   that's very clich√© for a banker, I know, but I was on golf
5   course on a day off and, essentially, it was easier for him to
6   walk across the street to open an account than it would be for
7   me to make a series of phone calls to get someone to reach out
8   to him.
9                MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, I'm at a natural stopping
10       point now.
11                THE COURT:  Sure.
12                Can you approach for a minute?
13                MS. MANGOLD:  Sure.

16                THE COURT:  I was just wondering how much more you
17       have with this witness?
18                MS. MANGOLD:  Probably an hour or so.
19                THE COURT:  Okay.
20                Do you have that much cross?
21                MR. BLANCHE:  It won't be as long as the direct.
22                THE COURT:  All right.  So we will call it a day.
23                MS. MANGOLD:  Thank you.
24                MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
25                (Sidebar concluded.)

1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And you were surprised to hear that?
3       A    I was.
4       Q    Surprised because you had told Howard to stay out of
5   it; right?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And, frankly, you were not happy to be hearing that;
8   correct?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And, at that point, when Howard contacted you about
11   this payment, the main concern was Howard's reputation; right?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    The concern was that Dylan Howard would look bad if
14   this payment wasn't made; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And he said that to you; right?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    He said:  "It can't be that in this industry somebody
19   promises to pay one of my sources and that doesn't happen, I
20   look bad?"
21       A    That is correct.
22       Q    And so you and Howard called Mr. Cohen; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And you said to Mr. Cohen:  "I want you to know, I'm
25   not paying or doing anything on this," right?

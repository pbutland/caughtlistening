1 I note on Page 123, Mr. Bove, at Line 20, says,
2 "I think we’re basically on the same page."
3 And then, on 1224, you express your concern. And
4 your concern is, "At some point, cumulatively, it becomes
5 cumulatively prejudicial."
6 So, I appreciate your concern, and I agree that
7 there could come a point where it will possibly become
8 prejudicial.
9 The difficulty is, I don't know at this point
10 what that’s going to be. So we’re just going to have to
11 keep going through it. You'll make your objections. I'll
12 consider the objections. And at some point, we may get
13 there.
14 I am relying, primarily, on People v. Settles,
15 S—E—T—T—L—E—S, 46 N.Y.2d 154, at Page 169. This is a Court
16 of Appeals decision. "Naturally, there can be no precise
17 demarkation or formulation of the proof which will
18 constitute sufficient support of evidence of a declaration
19 against penal interests. By its very nature, the
20 determination involves a delicate balance of diverse
21 factors and is entrusted to the sound judgment of the
22 trial court which is aptly suited to weigh the
23 circumstances surrounding the declaration and the evidence
24 used to bolster its reliability."
25 So, that's really what’s going to guide this

1   the office at Trump Tower, you recall hearing President Trump
2   discuss whether Stormy Daniels would be a good contestant?
3       A    I vaguely recall hearing him say that she was one of
4   the people that may be an interesting contestant on the show.
5       Q    Okay.
6        And the prosecutor just referred to her, I think, as an
7   "adult film actress"; correct?
8       A    Uh, yes.
9       Q    And you understood that to mean that she was,
10   colloquially speaking, a porn star; right?
11       A    I'd say that's a good synonym for it.
12       Q    And you knew she was a porn star because you had heard
13   discussions about her; right?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    And you had heard President Trump say that he thought
16   she would be an interesting addition to The Apprentice;
17   correct?
18       A    I can't recall a specific instance when I heard it.
19       It was part of the office chatter.
20       Q    And when Stormy Daniels showed up to Trump Tower to
21   meet President Trump, you understood that she was there to
22   discuss being cast for The Apprentice; correct?
23       A    I assumed that.
24       Q    And I understand your assumption was based on the
25   discussions you had heard, the office chatter; right?

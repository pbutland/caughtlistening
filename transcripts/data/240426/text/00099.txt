1   the provisions in the U.S. Code by Mr. Steinglass?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And those were hard questions because you weren't sure
4   what those provisions meant, right?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    I am not going to make this a law school exam either.
7   I am sorry.  Let's look at -- Mr. Bernik, if you can zoom in on
8   the next paragraph on the page.
9            Can you read to yourself that first sentence?
10       A    That the agreement can be resigned?
11       Q    Do you see the phrase, false, incomplete or misleading
12   testimony or information?
13       A    Yeah.
14       Q    So, basically, this paragraph gives the Federal
15   government some options if they determine that AMI, or its
16   representatives, have given false, incomplete or misleading
17   testimony or information, correct?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    If we can zoom in on the bottom paragraph of this
20   page.  So that first sentence refers to the period from the
21   date of the agreement until November 6, 2018.  Do you see that?
22       A    Yes, I do.
23       Q    There was, basically, a period of time where the
24   parties agreed to keep the agreement, to some extent, secret?
25       A    Yes, that's correct.

2                 record.)
3                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Sorry, Judge.  I am not trying
4       to be difficult.
5                 This is opinion testimony of a witness of the
6       credibility of another witness who hasn't testified yet.
7       That is not proper.  To attack a witness' credibility -- a
8       witness' credibility is being attacked for bad acts or
9       reputation for peacefulness, truthfulness in the community
10       by another witness.  The witness is not permitted to offer
11       his opinion of another witness.
12                 MR. BOVE:  The witness has been able to testify
13       and give his opinion here today about President Trump's
14       statements or admissions.
15                 The statements of Michael Cohen --
16                 THE COURT:  To the extent that you are asking him
17       his opinion, I am not going to -- you need to move on.  If
18       you want to impeach Michael Cohen, that is not the right
19       way to do it.  All right?
20                 MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge.
21                      (Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the
22                 following occurred in open court.)
23   BY MR. BOVE:
24       Q    You testified yesterday that the FEC investigation
25   actually ended in sort of an agreement with AMI, right?

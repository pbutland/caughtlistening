1       think this helps us to get to it.
2                 MR. BOVE:  What I would ask permission to do,
3       Judge, is finish the question that I was asking, which is
4       whether at the October 2019 meeting his attorneys told the
5       prosecutors that the agreement was inaccurate.
6                 THE COURT:  And leave it at that.
7                 MR. BOVE:  No.  Then I would confirm that, to his
8       knowledge, that it was never conveyed to the Federal
9       government.
10                 THE COURT:  You can finish your argument.  Go
11       ahead.
12                 MR. BOVE:  It is a very significant benefit
13       conferred on him by the District Attorney's Office and
14       it's -- and, please, I think you know, this is the first
15       cross-examination as a defense lawyer I have ever done.
16                 Please do not hold my shortcomings in the way I
17       am forming questions against President Trump.  This is
18       right at the core of what we are doing to impeach Mr.
19       Pecker.
20                 THE COURT:  Two things:  One, you are doing a
21       very good job.
22                 Two, that you may be doing a bad job in your
23       opinion is of no consequence.
24                 Whoever the defendant is, whatever the position
25       the defendant is running for and whoever represents him,

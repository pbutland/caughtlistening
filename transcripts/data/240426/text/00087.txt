5 THE COURT: Mr. Bove, I'm not trying to rush you,
6 but I just want to get a sense of where we stand?
7 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. I appreciate that.
8 I think I have less than an hour left, that's my
9 best guess.
10 THE COURT: And I imagine that there would be
11 redirect after that?
12 MR. STEINGLASS: I imagine.
13 THE COURT: All right. I will see you all in a few
14 minutes.
15 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

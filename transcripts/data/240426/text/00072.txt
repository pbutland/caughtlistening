1   Ms. Daniels had not been paid; right?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And it's true, isn't it, that Keith Davidson is in the
4   middle once again?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    Mr. Howard was using an attorney as a source, who was
7   providing information from his client to the National
8   Enquirer -- well, to Dylan Howard?
9       A    To Dylan Howard; that's correct.
10       Q    Not to AMI, because you had not authorized Dylan Howard
11   to be speaking with Davidson; correct?
12                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
13                THE COURT:  Sustained.
14       Q    I will break that up.
15       You did not authorize Dylan Howard to speak to Keith
16   Davidson about Stormy Daniels; correct?
17       A    That's correct.
18       Q    So anything that Dylan Howard was doing with respect
19   to Stormy Daniels was unauthorized and outside of his
20   employment?
21                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
22                THE COURT:  Sustained.
23       Q    When Mr. Howard came back to you on the Stormy Daniels
24   story, what he said was Michael Cohen has not paid Keith
25   Davidson; right?

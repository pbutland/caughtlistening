1       A    Can you repeat what you want -- what you asked me
2   again?
3       I'm sorry.
4       Q    I'm just trying to make sure that I understand it.  And
5   I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
6                THE COURT:  Maybe if you could rephrase the
7       question.
8                MR. BOVE:  Yes.
9       Q    Your testimony yesterday is inconsistent with what's
10   written in that report; right?
11       A    Yes.
12                MR. BOVE:  Judge, I have a couple more topics.
13                I don't know if there is a mid morning break
14       planned.
15                THE COURT:  Sure.  All right.
16                Jurors, let's go ahead and take our mid morning
17       recess.
18                I will see you in about 15 minutes.  Can you step
19       out.
20                THE COURT OFFICER:  Leave your note pads on the
21       chairs.
22                All rise.
23                (Jury exits.)
24                  **********
25                 THE COURT:  Thank you.  Please have a seat.

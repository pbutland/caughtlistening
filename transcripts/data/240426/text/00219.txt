13       Q    And can you just explain what you mean by KYC forms?
14       A    KYC is "Know Your Customer."  It's a way in which --

16   they say they are.
17       Q    And is KYC something that's in place as a result of a
18   law that banks are required to follow?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Were the types of bank account records that you looked
21   at the type of records that are routinely generated and relied
22   upon by the bank?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Did First Republic create and maintain the bank records
25   in the regular course of its business?

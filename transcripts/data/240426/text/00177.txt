16       Q.   So showing you People's Exhibit 82.  Can you please
17   explain to the jury what this is?
18       A.   It's an entry in "contacts" for Karen McDougal and it
19   lists her -- it's redacted, but it lists her business phone
20   number, business address, and email address, and then there is a
21   notation for an old address.
22       Q.   So is there a total of two physical addresses listed?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And a cell phone number and an email address?
25       A.   Correct.

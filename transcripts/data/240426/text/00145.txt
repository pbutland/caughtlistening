1 campaign, is that right?
2 A Yes.
3 Q And I believe you told us, and it was in the document
4 that we showed you, you never had any intention of publishing
5 her story?
6 A No, we weren't going to publish her story.
7 Q Mr. Bove asked you, wouldn't that story have sold
8 magazines?
9 Well, let me ask you the question.
10 Had you published a story about a Playboy model having
11 a year—long sexual affair, while he was married, with a
12 presidential candidate, would that have sold magazines do you
13 think?
14 A Yes.
15 Q That would be like National Enquirer gold?
16 A Yes.
17 Q But at the time that you entered into that agreement,
18 you had zero intention of publishing that story?
19 A That's correct.
20 Q And despite the fact that publishing that story would
21 have helped your bottom line, you killed the story because it
22 helped the candidate, Donald Trump?
23 A Yes.
24 THE COURT: Is this a good time to break?
25 MR. STEINGLASS: Sure.

1   email that you received?
2       A    Well, I am not in the business of being in Back to the
3   Future, so this was definitely the way that it's pulled through
4   our server in San Francisco, so that would be the time in
5   Pacific.
6       Q    So the bottom email on the chain is in Eastern Standard
7   Time and the top email on the chain is in Pacific Time?
8       A    That's correct.
9       Q    And is it going to be the case for the rest of the
10   files in -- and emails in the exhibits that we just talked
11   about, that the top email chain only is going to be in Pacific
12   Time?
13       A    That's correct.  The most recent email or the last
14   email would be the Pacific Time; everything below it would be in
15   Eastern Time.
16       Q    All right.  Turning now to the top email in the chain.
17   You said this is an email from you?
18                 (Displayed.)
19       A    This is an email from me to one of my team members,
20   Olivia Cassin.
21       And this was after the phone call with Michael Cohen, and he
22   mentioned that he needs an account opened for Michael Cohen
23   immediately and he wants no address on checks.
24       Q    Was it unusual for Mr. Cohen to request something get
25   done immediately?

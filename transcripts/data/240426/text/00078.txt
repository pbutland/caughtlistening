D. Pecker - Cross/Bove
Page 1408
1                MR. BOVE:  I intend to lay a foundation, Judge,
2       that Mr. Pecker was well aware of events surrounding
3       Mr. Comey.
4                He was well aware of the subsequent investigations
5       at issue and that connection with this investigation,
6       Mr. Comey made emphatically clear that on January 26th,
7       2017, was at Trump Tower with a classified briefing in an
8       individual meeting in a conference room and not at his desk
9       and that there was a very intense conversation.
10                And the point of that cross is to illustrate that
11       the witness has misremembered what he saw that day when he
12       talked about Jim Comey, because there was nothing to talk
13       about regarding Fort Lauderdale.
14                THE COURT:  That's an awful lot of information to
15       bring out just to get to the point that he misremembered
16       something.
17                MR. BOVE:  This witness is a critical witness, and
18       his memory --
19                THE COURT:  I think you are doing a good job with
20       his memory.
21                I don't think you need to go there.
22                (Sidebar concluded.)
23                *******
24                THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.
25                MR. BOVE:  Mr. Bernik, can we just take a look at

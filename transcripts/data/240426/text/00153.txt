1       Q.   I believe you testified on direct examination that
2   sometime later Dylan Howard came back to you because Michael
3   Cohen hadn't delivered on his promise to pay Stormy Daniels off;
4   is that right?
5       A.   That's correct.  That's correct.
6       Q.   And he asked you to reach out to Michael Cohen?
7       A.   Yes, he did.
8       Q.   I believe you testified on direct examination that
9   you, Michael Cohen and Dylan Howard had a three-way call on
10   October 25, 2016, regarding Stormy Daniels; is that right?
11       A.   That's correct.
12       Q.   Can you remind the jury, please, what you discussed on
13   that call?
14       A.   We called Michael Cohen on the Signal.  "We" being
15   Dylan Howard and myself.  And Dylan made a presentation to
16   Michael Cohen.  He was very aggressive over the phone and
17   told Michael:  "These two sources are very important to me.
18   If you don't pay them, you're ruining my reputation.  You
19   promised to wire the money two times and you never did."
20            Then Michael Cohen said to me I should buy it.
21            I said to Michael Cohen: "Absolutely not.  I am not
22   paying for the story.  I told you a number of times, I don't
23   want to be involved with it.  My suggestion to you is, you
24   should buy the story--" you being Michael Cohen -- "should buy
25   the story, because if you don't, and as Dylan just said to us

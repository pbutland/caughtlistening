1   BY MR. BOVE:
2       Q.   Mr. Pecker, before lunch you were asked some questions
3   by Mr. Steinglass about "attack ads;" do you recall those
4   questions?
5       A.   Yes, I do.
6       Q.   The National Enquirer didn't run any attack ads
7   relating to President Trump's opponents, correct?
8       A.   Can you define for me that, what the headlines were?
9       Q.   There were headlines, but not attack ads?
10       A.   That's correct.
11       Q.   We talked about some of those headlines this morning,
12   right?
13       A.   We did.
14       Q.   Do you remember that before lunch Mr. Steinglass
15   referred to Michael Cohen as a "fixer?"
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   And you said repeatedly during your testimony that Mr.
18   Cohen told you he was President Trump's personal attorney?
19       A.   Yes, he did.
20       Q.   You know from your experience that private attorneys
21   can hold fundraisers for campaigns without being a part of the
22   campaign, right?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   That type of fundraiser doesn't make a private attorney
25   some part of the campaign, correct?

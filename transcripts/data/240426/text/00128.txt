1       Q    And I am just going to scroll through all the pages in
2   this exhibit and ask you to keep your eyes out to see if there
3   are any bills for services rendered in the months June, July,
4   August?
5       A    Yes, there were.
6       Q    So I want to direct your attention to page eight.  Do
7   you see a bill for services rendered on August 3rd of 2016?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And does that refresh your recollection which -- well,
10   does that refresh your recollection as to how many hours AMI
11   was billed in connection with outside counsel's review of the
12   Karen McDougal contract?
13       A    It was a half an hour.
14       Q    Half an hour.
15            I am showing you what's in evidence as People's
16   Exhibit 156, and this can be shown to everyone.
17            There is the contract that AMI signed with Karen
18   McDougal, is that right?
19       A    That's correct.
20       Q    And you were asked extensively about this on
21   cross-examination, is that right?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    Just to remind us, what is the effective date of this
24   contract?
25       A    August 5th.

1   had about 40 million unique users in the United States?
2       A    I don't recall that.
3                 MR. BOVE:  Mr. Bernik, can we please bring up a
4        document marked for identification. This is just for the
5        Court, the parties and Mr. Pecker.  It's been marked for
6        identification as A138.
7                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
8        screen and the parties' screens, and the witness reviews
9        the exhibit on his screen.)
10       A    I don't see where it says 40 million.
11                 MR. BOVE:  Can we turn to the next page, please?
12                 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on
13        his screen.)
14       A    Yeah. 40 million unique users.
15                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
16                 Move to strike his answer in terms of the base of
17        his knowledge.
18                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
19                 MR. BOVE:  We can take that down, Mr. Bernik.
20       Q    Did that document refresh your recollection that, in
21   2016, The Guardian had about 40 million unique users on its
22   website?
23                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
24                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
25       A    I --

1       A    Because it would be something the bank would want to
2   know.
3       Q    And if somebody checked "yes," is that something that
4   would require additional review by the bank?
5       A    Yes, it would.
6       Q    All right.
7                MS. MANGOLD:  I think we can take this down.
8       Q    Now, do you recall what happened with the bank account
9   that Mr. Cohen tried to open for Resolution Consultants LLC?
10       A    Yes.  It was -- we did all of our work to establish it,
11   but it was never funded.
12       Q    And what does that mean that "it was never funded?"
13       A    A deposit was never made in the account, so the account
14   never went live.
15       Q    So the account was never actually opened?
16       A    Technically, no.
17       Q    Did Mr. Cohen explain why he didn't fund the account?
18       A    Not until asked, and not until he reached out and
19   stated he wanted to open a different entity instead.
20       Q    But just to be clear, the Resolution Consultants
21   account was never opened?
22       A    It was never opened.
23                  MS. MANGOLD:  Let's pull up People's Exhibit 367
24        in evidence.

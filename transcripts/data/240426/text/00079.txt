9       Q    And, Mr. Pecker, this is testimony that you gave of --
10                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection, Judge.
11                I think this is being displayed -- this is the
12       transcript being displayed to the jury here.
13                THE COURT:  Can you take that down, please.
14                Please approach.

17                THE COURT:  All right.
18                MR. BOVE:  I don't mean to run afoul of your rules;
19       I have done that this morning already.
20                THE COURT:  You did do that this morning already.
21                I found it really unusual.
22                There was no objection, so I allowed it, but there
23       is an objection now.
24                MR. BOVE:  This is evidence, Judge.  This is the
25       transcript.  Why can't I receive it in and display it?

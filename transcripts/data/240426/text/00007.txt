1 prosecutors he is talking about.
2 So, if that’s unclear from the question, I will
3 object, and I just wanted to explain.
4 THE COURT: That's fair, because there was more
5 than one prosecutor’s office involved here.
6 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.
7 Finally, Judge, I just want to bring the Court’s
8 attention to that we caught a reference in People's 174A
9 to a lie detector that was gonna be taken live.
10 I don’t know if your Honor noticed it when we had
11 the witness on the stand.
12 I don't think your Honor precluded reference to
13 the lie detector. Just the results of the lie detector.
14 We’ve taken a broad view of that and have
15 redacted references where we’ve seen them.
16 I notified counsel and swapped out a new version
17 of 174A that contains a redaction just of the word "lie
18 detector".
19 THE COURT: Is that it for the People?
20 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: How about the Defense?
22 MR. BOVE: No, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 We can get the witness, please.
25 COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

Page 1455
1       Q    Can we put up People's Exhibit 182, please, paragraph
2   five, and this can go out to everybody.  Thank you.
3            It is a little hard for me to read it from back here.
4            This is part of the Statement of Admitted Facts that
5   AMI entered into with the Southern District of New York that is
6   appended to the Non-Prosecution Agreement, is that right?
7       A    That's correct.
8       Q    And did you say, or did AMI say in this document that
9   AMI's principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to
10   suppress the model's story so as to prevent it from influencing
11   the election?
12       A    That is correct.
13       Q    Is that true, Mr. Pecker?  Was that your purpose in
14   locking up the Karen McDougal story, to influence the election?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    The provisions about her being on the cover, covers
17   and writing articles that she wasn't even writing, why was that
18   included in the contract?
19       A    It was included in the contract, basically, as a
20   disguise of what the actual purpose of it was.
21       Q    What was the actual purpose of it?
22       A    The actual purpose was to acquire lifetime rights to a
23   story so it doesn't -- so it's not published.  It wouldn't be
24   published by American Media.  It would not be published by any
25   other media source.

D. Pecker - Cross/Bove
Page 1438
1       Q    And if we can now look at the page ending 047.
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And if we zoom in on the first half, please.  And I
4   want you to read this, and then let me know when you are done
5   and I have a question or two.
6            And does that refresh your recollection that paragraph
7   three of the Non-Prosecution Agreement was discussed in this
8   meeting?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    You can see that at the top, right?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And the next entry is a statement by one of your
13   attorneys, correct?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    And does that refresh your recollection that the
16   attorney said in response to a question about paragraph three,
17   I think that may be inaccurate.  I think that came up with the
18   Feds, I have never heard Pecker say that?
19            Does that refresh your recollection that that was said
20   during the meeting?
21       A    No.  And I would like to clarify it, if I can.
22       Q    Okay.
23       A    The only wording here is the word, purchasing, selling
24   stories.
25       Q    Meaning?

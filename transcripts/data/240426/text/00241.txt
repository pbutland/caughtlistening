2       Q    And looking at the questions towards the top third of
3   the page.
4       In the form does it say -- does this have the same question
5   that we saw in the Resolution Consultants form?
6       It says:  "Is the entity associated with political
7   fundraising or political action committee."
8       A    Yes.  This is just the digital form of what was
9   provided earlier, which would be the hard copy.
10       Q    What's the answer to the political fundraising question
11   on the form?
12       A    Is "No."
13       Q    Now, turning to the business narrative portion in the
14   middle of the page.
15       What business narrative is provided for Essential
16   Consultants LLC?
17       A    It's Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants LLC
18   as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for
19   investment consulting work he does for real estate deals.
20       Q    And is that consistent with the description of the LLC
21   that he provided to you on the call earlier that day?
22       A    Yes, it is.
23       Q    Do you have an understanding of how it came to be that
24   DeWitt Hutchins was the one filling out this information when
25   Mr. Cohen called you?

D. Pecker - Cross/Bove
Page 1436
1       you are all being well-compensated to come here and do a
2       great job.  To tell me not to hold it against your youth
3       suggests that I shouldn't enforce the rules of evidence,
4       and I am not going to do that.
5                 I will allow you to ask those two questions and
6       that's it.  Beyond that, it will just get confusing.
7                 MR. BOVE:  So I don't overstep, I can ask if he
8       is aware that his attorneys argued in this meeting that the
9       agreement was inaccurate?
10                 THE COURT:  Now, are you saying that he was
11       there?
12                 MR. BOVE:  Yes.  And I would ask permission, if
13       he doesn't remember, to refresh him.
14                 THE COURT:  Just ask him, and then follow up with
15       the second question.
16                 MR. BOVE:  That to his knowledge this was never
17       conveyed to SDNY?
18                 THE COURT:  Yes, and leave it at that.
19                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you, Judge.
20                      (Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the
21                 following occurred in open court.)
22   BY MR. BOVE:
23       Q    Thank you.
24            Mr. Pecker, so, before the side-bar, we were talking
25   about the October 2019 meeting, right?

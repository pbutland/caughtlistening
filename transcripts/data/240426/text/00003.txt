1   Court.
2            But, the fact that you said you're pretty much on
3   the same page, we're in agreement with who is a
4   co-conspirator in this case: Dylan Howard. We're in
5   agreement that at least some, if not most, of the
6   responses are coming in for some purpose. And we're also
7   in agreement that there will be redactions to that.
8            MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge.
9            Thank you. I appreciate and understand all of
10   that.
11            Just for the record, when you said we're in
12   agreement about who's a co-conspirator, we understand the
13   Court's ruling, and we're abiding by it.
14            Our objection has been noted.
15            And I will confer with Mr. Steinglass and the
16   Government over the weekend about the proposed redactions,
17   and we'll get back to the Court on Tuesday.
18            THE COURT:  Of course.
19            Once you do that, please let me know what you
20   suggest the instruction should be to the jury, what is it
21   they're considering that other language for.
22            MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge.
23            Thank you.
24            THE COURT:  We're going to break today at 12:30
25   to hear the People's motion, motion to compel.

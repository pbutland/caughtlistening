1            I've reviewed Bornholdt and its authorities, and
2   I'll lay a proper foundation.
3            THE COURT:  Thank you.
4            I think that's sufficient to address the issue.
5            MR. STEINGLASS:  Next. Whatever Mr. Bove's
6   intentions were with regard to the questions about prior
7   meetings with the DA's Office and reviewing materials, I
8   think that he left a misleading impression that that
9   contact was somehow improper, and I don't think it would
10   be appropriate to wait until the end of the case to give
11   the CJI instruction on pretrial preparation.

13            The Court has been very reasonable about giving

18            MR. BOVE:  May I have just one moment, Judge?
19            THE COURT:  Sure.
20            (Whereupon, defense counsel confer.)
21            MR. BOVE:  Judge, I think there was an
22   instruction along these lines in your preliminary
23   instructions, so I think the jury is aware of this issue.
24            I'm not sure it's necessary.
25            THE COURT:  There was a brief reference to it. It

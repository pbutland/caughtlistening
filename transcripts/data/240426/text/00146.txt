1                 THE COURT:  Jurors, we will stop now for our
2       lunch break.
3                 I remind you of all the admonitions, including do
4       not discuss this case either amongst yourselves or with
5       anyone else.
6                 Please continue to keep an open mind.
7                 Do not form or express an opinion about the
8       defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is in
9       and I have given you my final instructions on the law.
10                 Enjoy your lunch.
11                 COURT OFFICER:  All rise.
12                      (Jurors are excused.)
13                 THE COURT:  You can step down.
14                      (Witness is excused.)
15                 THE COURT:  Please be seated.
16                 So, I am not going to rush you.  Give me a sense
17       of how much longer you are going to be.
18                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I have Post Its, on Post Its
19       here.  I am going to consolidate over lunch.  I think,
20       maybe, a half hour or less.
21                 THE COURT:  At this point, do you expect to have
22       any re-cross?
23                 MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge.
24                 THE COURT:  All right.  Enjoy your lunch.  See
25       you at 2:15.

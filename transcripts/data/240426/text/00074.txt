8   January 6th, 2017.
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And I think you said that that meeting happened at
11   Trump Tower; right?
12       A    That's correct.
13       Q    And I think you said that the way that the -- the
14   reason that that dates sticks out to you is that there was a
15   very violent incident that day; right?

17       Q    At the Fort Lauderdale Airport?

19       Q    I think five people died that day?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    And then, obviously, there was a lot of coverage of
22   that; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And, so, in your memory, you sort of pegged it, the
25   date of that meeting to that incident; right?

1       Q    And I think that one of the questions was whether this
2   document was set up so that it would disguise the other
3   provisions in the Agreement.
4       Do you remember that question?
5       A    Yes, I do.
6       Q    And I think you said:  "Yes, this paragraph was
7   designed to disguise the other paragraphs;" right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    But there were actually very real paragraphs in this
10   agreement; right?
11       A    Yes.
12                 MR. BOVE:  And you can zoom back out, please,
13        Mr. Bernik.
14       Q    Very real obligations for AMI; correct?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And, in fact, you told the Federal Prosecutors that you
17   believed it was critically important to follow the words of the
18   McDougal Agreement because you did not want any illegal or
19   campaign violations that would open the door to legal action by
20   McDougal?
21                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
22                THE COURT:  Sustained.
23       Q    You told the Federal Prosecutors that the other
24   provisions of this agreement mattered; right?
25       A    Yes, I did.

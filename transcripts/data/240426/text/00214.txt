3       A    Yes.

5   to fill out in order to do that?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    Did Mr. Cohen understand that there was a review
8   process that had to take place by the bank before he opened an
9   account?
10       A    Um, I assume he would be, yes, because he's done it
11   before.

19       Q    Do you understand that you are testifying here today,
20   in addition to other things, as a custodian of records for

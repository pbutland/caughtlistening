1       Q    And now, Mr. Bernik, if you can zoom in on the
2   carry-over paragraph on the second page.
3            And so, this language refers to the time period of the
4   agreement, right?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And so, this agreement is still active, correct?

21   this agreement.
22            And it says the date on which all prosecutions arising

24   agreement are final.  I don't understand.

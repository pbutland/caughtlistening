10 following language, solely for the purpose of settling this

12 merit of the Commission's legal conclusions, Respondent agrees
13 not to contest that AMI's payment to Karen McDougal to purchase
14 a limited life story right, combined with its decision not to
15 publish the story in consultation with an agent of Donald J.
16 Trump, and for the purpose of influencing the election,
17 constituted a prohibitive corporate in—kind contribution in
18 violation of 52 USC Section 30118(a).
19 Does the page that Mr. Bove showed you contain that
20 language?
21 A Yes.
22 Q Was it your understanding when AMI entered into this
23 agreement that AMI was acknowledging that the conduct that it
24 had committed in connection with the Karen McDougal payment
25 violated Federal Election Law?

D. Pecker - Cross/Bove
Page 1439
1       A    Meaning my -- the testimony that I gave, and what I
2   said was, I offered at that meeting that being the eyes and
3   ears and hearing any stories that are there, I would offer --
4   that women would be selling them, and I would be offering them
5   to Michael Cohen.  That's what I said.
6            So, the selling here and purchasing, basically, are
7   synonymous.  Somebody has to buy them.
8       Q    Does that -- my question is a little more
9   straightforward.  I appreciate the clarification.
10            My question is, in response to a question from a
11   prosecutor about the provision in the Non-Prosecution
12   Agreement, did your attorney say, I think that may be
13   inaccurate, I think that came up with the Feds, I have never
14   heard Pecker say that?
15                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
16                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
17       A    Yes.
18                 THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.
19       A    I am sorry.
20       Q    There was a dispute in that meeting about some of the
21   language in the agreement, right?
22                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
23                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
24                 He can answer.
25       A    Yes, it was just the one word.

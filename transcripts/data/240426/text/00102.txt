1   Directors, you reviewed and approved as indicated in the
2   agreement itself, right?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    Can we zoom in on paragraph three, please?
5            Now, you testified earlier this morning about the
6   August 2015 meeting.  Do you remember that testimony?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    Do you remember that you confirmed that during the
9   August 2015 meeting there was no discussion on catch and kill,
10   correct?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And during the August 2015 meeting there was no
13   discussion of a financial component to any agreement with
14   President Trump and Michael Cohen, correct?
15       A    There was a discussion about that I was going to be
16   the eyes and ears of the campaign.  And there was a discussion
17   that I would be notifying Michael Cohen of any women that were
18   in the process of or going to be selling stories.  And I would
19   notify Cohen that they would be available, and they would
20   either have to buy them or take them off the market or kill
21   them in some manner.
22       Q    Are you testifying now that there was a discussion of
23   the kill agreement?
24                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
25                 THE COURT:  Sustained.

10       -- during the FBI investigation, I know what I said
11   yesterday happened, so I can't reconcile what the FBI interview

13       Q    So you can't reconcile because what you said yesterday

15       A    Yes, but I wouldn't be responsible for this report.
16       Q    I understand.
17       And so are you suggesting that the FBI made a mistake

19       A    I know what the truth is.  I'm not -- I can't state

21   exactly what was said to me.
22       Q    And so your testimony yesterday is inconsistent with
23   what's written there?
24                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
25                THE COURT:  Overruled.

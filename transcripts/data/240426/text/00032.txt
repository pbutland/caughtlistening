1   saying the things that Mr. Sajudin was saying, you believed
2   that if those were true, it could be the biggest National
3   Enquirer article ever?
4       A    That is correct.
5       Q    And I think you testified about the Enquirer's
6   coverage of Elvis Presley's death; right?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    I think, if I'm recollecting correctly, there were
9   about 6.5 million sales associated with the National Enquirer's
10   coverage of that death?
11       A    That is correct.
12       Q    And you thought that if this story was true,
13   Mr. Sajudin's claim was true, that it could sell 10 million
14   National Enquirers; right?
15       A    I did.
16       Q    So, if this story was true, you were gonna run it;
17   correct?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Because you had a fiduciary obligation to do that;
20   right?
21       A    That is correct.
22       Q    It would have made business sense, to put it mildly,
23   to run such an article if it was true; correct?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And as soon as you heard the story about Mr. Sajudin,

D. Pecker - Redirect/Steinglass
Page 1462
1                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, I object and ask to be heard at
2       side-bar.
3                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
4                 You want to approach?
5                 MR. BOVE:  Yes, please.
6                      (Discussion is held at side-bar, on the
7                 record.)
8                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, I can clean some of this up on
9       re-cross, but Mr. Pecker did not sign this agreement.  And
10       it's been repeatedly embedded that this is his agreement.
11                 This is AMI's agreement entered into at a time
12       after he left AMI.
13                 And the cover page is a cover letter from the FEC
14       with the agreement, and says that the matter being
15       investigated, as to when Mr. Pecker was dismissed --
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think I clarified this was an
17       agreement that AMI entered into.
18                 In any event, Mr. Bove, is permitted to clarify
19       anything he wants to.
20                 THE COURT:  I think Mr. Steinglass has a right to
21       go back and clear it up.  I think you left the jury with a
22       certain impression.
23                      (Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the
24                 following occurred in open court.)

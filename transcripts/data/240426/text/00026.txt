1       A    Correct.
2       Q    So, it wasn't new information published; correct?
3       A    That's correct.
4       Q    Substantially, everything in the exhibits you were
5   shown in 153A, 153B and 153C, what was going on was the
6   National Enquirer was recycling information from other
7   publications because it was cost effective and made business
8   sense?
9                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
10                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
11                 You can answer.
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    And you talked about the National Enquirer relying on
14   sources; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    There was a source network of sorts; right?
17       A    That's correct.
18       Q    And one of the things that can be valuable to somebody
19   in this industry is cultivating a network of sources; right?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    So the people that work for you can draw on those
22   sources to get sensitive details; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    But, that's not what was happening with respect to the
25   articles we just looked at; right?

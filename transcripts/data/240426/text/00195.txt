1       A    I believe so.
2       Q    And you met with the prosecutor a number of times
3   before testifying here today?
4       A    Yes, I did.
5       Q    And the only reason you're here, testifying today, is
6   because you worked at The Trump Organization; right?
7       A    I believe so.
8       Q    You have nothing personal to add to this; right?
9       A    I can't believe I do, no.
10       Q    You don't want to be here; do you?
11       A    Correct.
12       Q    And lawyers are expensive; aren't they?
13       A    I haven't seen the bills, but I assume they are.
14       Q    And you understand The Trump Organization is paying
15   for the lawyers for all of the employees; right?
16       A    That is my understanding.
17       Q    And that's because they're all only here because --
18                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
19                 THE COURT:  Sustained. Sustained.
20       Q    No one -- is the payment of your legal fees
21   conditioned at all on how you testify?
22       A    No, that's not my understanding.
23       Q    No one from The Trump Organization has told you how to
24   testify; right?
25       A    Absolutely not.

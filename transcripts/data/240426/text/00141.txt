1   meeting at Trump Tower.  Prior to that, did you ever preview
2   with a candidate positive stories about that candidate or
3   negative stories about that candidate's opponents?
4       A    No.
5       Q    Prior to that August of 2015 meeting, did you ever
6   give a candidate the opportunity to accept, reject or make
7   changes to your stories before they ran?
8       A    No.
9       Q    Prior to that arrangement with Mr. Trump from August
10   of 2015, did you ever run attack ads against any candidate's
11   adversaries that corresponded to those adversaries' polling
12   numbers?
13       A    No.
14       Q    Mr. Bove elicited from you that a lot of the articles,
15   the negative attack articles against Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz
16   were recycled, I believe, was the term that he used?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    Notwithstanding the fact that they were recycled at
19   the time that AMI reprinted them, was AMI doing that because
20   those candidates were surging in the polls against Mr. Trump?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And was that done in coordination with Mr. Trump's
23   campaign?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    You testified on cross-examination that even before

1       A    Every time Michael Cohen spoke to me, he gave a sense
2   of urgency.
3       Q    And this is one of those times?
4       A    This is one of those times.
5       Q    All right.
6                MS. MANGOLD:  Can we take this down and show
7       People's Exhibit 368.
8                (Displayed.)
9       Q    So what type of document is this?
10       A    This is our internal Know Your Customer form.
11       Q    And this is the KYC form that you were referring to
12   earlier?
13       A    That's correct.
14       Q    And is the bank required to fill this out for every
15   client and customer?
16       A    Yes, they are.
17       Q    And looking now at the portion below the title of the
18   document where it says, "Created By."
19       A    This was created by DeWitt Hutchins.
20       Q    Who is DeWitt Hutchins?
21       A    DeWitt Hutchins at the time was a preferred banker.  He
22   worked in one of the offices, and the particular office was the
23   one on 56th and Madison.
24       Q    Was that the one across the street from Mr. Cohen's
25   office?

1       Q.   Why did you reach out to Michael Cohen when you learned
2   that Stormy Daniels had a story involving sexual infidelity with
3   Mr. Trump?
4       A.   Based on our mutual agreement back in August 2015, any
5   stories concerning Mr. Trump that would be very embarrassing, I
6   would want to communicate that with Michael Cohen right away.
7            If he heard it from somebody else, he would go
8   ballistic.
9       Q.   Who is "he?"
10       A.   If Michael Cohen heard the story, that he heard it from
11   someone else.  I was referring to Michael Cohen.
12       Q.   And so when you -- withdrawn.
13            When you reached out to Michael Cohen, it was, as you
14   just said, to notify him, as you had promised to do in that
15   August 2015 meeting?
16       A.   That's correct.
17       Q.   When you told Mr. Bove that you wanted nothing to do
18   with it, you weren't going to print it; is that correct?
19       A.   Print it or buy it or be associated with it.
20       Q.   You weren't going to print it, you weren't going to pay
21   for it, you weren't going to be associated?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   You were still going to fulfill your obligation to tell
24   Michael Cohen about it so that the campaign would squash it?
25       A.   Yes.

1   then that would be determined.  That's above my pay grade. That
2   would be determined by our second level of support.
3       Q    Were there any transactions that the bank did not
4   process at all?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    Can you give us some examples?
7       A    Any transaction that would be going to a sanctioned
8   country, any transaction that would be going to someone who
9   would be considered on a person-of-interest list, potential
10   terrorist, something along those lines, we would not process
11   that transaction.
12       Then there's also lines of business that we just decide as
13   an institution that we will not do business with.
14       Q    Can you give some examples of those?
15       A    We didn't do gambling. We wouldn't do anything in the
16   adult entertainment. We wouldn't do anything that involved
17   check cashing.
18       Those are a couple of examples.
19       Q    Can you describe what you mean when you say "adult
20   entertainment"?
21       A    Porno. Um, I guess you would consider them strip
22   clubs, or anything along those lines.
23       Q    So, the bank wouldn't do business in the adult film
24   industry, in other words?
25       A    No.

1       Q    Do you know someone named Michael Cohen?
2       A    Yes, I do.
3       Q    How do you know him?
4       A    Michael Cohen was assigned to me after a colleague
5   left as a client in 2015.
6       Q    Do you know how long Michael Cohen had been a client
7   of the bank when he was assigned to you in 2015?
8       A    I do not know exactly.
9       Q    Had he been a client of the bank for some time by the
10   time you took over the client relationship?
11       A    Definitely a couple of years or so. I'm not sure
12   exactly how much time, though.
13       Q    Do you know why you were selected to take over the
14   Michael Cohen relationship?
15       A    I can only tell you what I was told, um, that I was
16   selected because of my knowledge and my ability to handle, um,
17   individuals that may be a little challenging.
18       Q    How long did you work with Michael Cohen?
19       A    Um, from 2015 until I believe it was 2018 or '19. I'm
20   not exactly sure of the end date.
21       Q    And in those several years where you worked with him,
22   did you have frequent interactions with him?
23       A    Not frequent, no.
24       Michael did a lot of his own business. And, frankly, I
25   didn't find him that difficult. He did a lot of his own

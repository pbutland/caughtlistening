15       can act jointly to commit a crime, and that in certain
16       circumstances, each can be held criminally liable for the
17       acts of the others.  In that situation, those persons can
18       be said to be, acting in concert with each other.
19                 Our law defines the circumstance under which one
20       person may be criminally liable for the conduct of another.

22                 When one person engages in conduct which
23       constitutes an offense, another is criminally liable for
24       such conduct when, acting with the state of mind required
25       for the commission of that offense, he or she solicits,
    commission of the crime.

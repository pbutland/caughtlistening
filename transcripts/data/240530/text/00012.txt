5 evidence that any of the assertions in the articles are

13 the limited purpose of demonstrating that the articles were
14 published and the document created.
15 There were also some text messages that were
16 accepted with a similar limitation.
17 For example, People’s Exhibit 171—A with respect
18 to Gina Rodriguez's texts and 257 with respect to Chris
19 Cuomo’s texts, those text messages were accepted for the
20 limited purpose of providing context for the responses by
21 Dylan Howard and Michael Cohen.
22 The exhibits which were accepted into evidence
23 with a limiting instruction are 152, 153—A, 153—B, 153—C,
24 161, 171—A, 180, 181 and 257.

Jury Deliberation — Re—charge
4918
1 it is not raining, and when you wake up in the morning, you
2 look out your window. You do not see rain, but you see
3 that the street and sidewalk are wet, and that people are
4 wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. Under those
5 circumstances, it may be reasonable to infer, that is
6 conclude, that it rained during the night.
7 In other words, the fact of it having rained
8 while you were asleep is an inference that might be drawn
9 from the proven facts of the presence of the water on the
10 street and sidewalk, and people in raincoats and carrying
11 umbrellas.
12 An inference must only by drawn from a proven
13 fact or facts, and then, only if the inference flows
14 naturally, reasonably and logically from the proven fact or
15 facts, not if it is speculative.
16 Therefore, in deciding whether to draw an
17 inference, you must look at and consider all the facts in
18 light of reason, common sense and experience.
19 As you know, certain exhibits were admitted into
20 evidence with some portions blacked out or redacted. Those
21 redactions were made to remove personal identifying
22 information and to ensure that only relevant admissible
23 evidence was put before you.
24 You may not speculate as to what material was
25 redacted or why, and you may not draw any inference,

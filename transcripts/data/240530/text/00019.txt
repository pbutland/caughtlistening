1 You may consider whether a witness has been
2 convicted of a crime or has engaged in criminal conduct,

6 witness who has been convicted of a crime or who has
7 engaged in criminal conduct, or to accept the testimony of

9 You may, however, consider whether a witness’s
10 criminal conviction or conduct has affected the
11 truthfulness of the witness’s testimony.
12 You may consider whether a witness made
13 statements at this trial that are inconsistent with each
14 other.
15 You may consider whether a witness made previous
16 statements that are inconsistent with his or her testimony
17 at trial.
18 You may consider whether a witness testified to a
19 fact here at trial that the witness omitted to state at a
20 prior time, when it would have been reasonable and logical
21 for the witness to have stated that fact. In determining
22 whether it would have been reasonable and logical for the
23 witness to have stated the omitted fact, you may consider
24 whether the witness’s attention was called to the matter,
25 and whether the witness was specifically asked about it.

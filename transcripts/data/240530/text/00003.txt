Jury Deliberation — Re—charge

1 MR. STEINGLASS: Do you want to start on Page 6?
2 MR. BLANCHE: I guess the only question is

8 And then there was a second request:

10 with a 3.5 MM input jack for use with the evidence laptop.
11 I confirmed that we can provide them with such
12 headphones, and I am also told that we can provide them

17 MR. BLANCHE: Agreed.

19 Okay. If there is nothing else to clarify, let's

21 MR. STEINGLASS: I don’t think the Court
22 Reporters have the last thing added this morning. I just

25 So, we are adding Page 1481, Line 4 through Page

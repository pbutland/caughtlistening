1 THE COURT: Thank you.
2 Jurors, I want to thank you very much for your
3 service in this case.
4 We started picking a jury here on April 15th. We
5 had opening statements on April 22nd. And we didn't have
6 summations until May 21st. That's a long time. That's a
7 long time you were away from your jobs, your families,
8 your other responsibilities.
9 But, not only that, you were engaged in a very
lO stressful and difficult task.
11 I want you to know that I really admire your
12 dedication and your hard work.
13 I observed you. As I said before, I observed you
14 during the course of the trial, and I could see how
15 involved you were, how engaged you were, how invested you
16 were in this process. And you gave this matter the
17 attention it deserved. I want to thank you for that.
18 I want to thank the alternate jurors, as well.
19 We couldn't do this without you.
20 I've had plenty of trials where I've had to use
21 one or all of my alternate jurors. Without service of the
22 alternate jurors, I would not have completed those trials.
23 Thank you very much.
24 Jurors, you'll remember, during the course of the
25 trial I gave you certain admonitions many, many times.

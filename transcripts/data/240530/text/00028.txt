3                 Section 17-152 of the New York Election Law
4       provides that any two or more than persons who conspire to
5       promote or prevent the election of any person to a public
6       office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon

12       office by unlawful means, he or she agrees with one or more

20                 Thus, a person acts with the intent that conduct
21       be performed that would promote or prevent the election of
22       a person to public office by unlawful means when his or her
23       conscious objective or purpose is that such conduct be
24       performed.

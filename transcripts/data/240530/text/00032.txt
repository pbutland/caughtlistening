2       which I will define for you now, is a violation of tax
3       laws.
4                 Under New York State and New York City law, it is
5       unlawful to knowingly supply or submit materially false or
6       fraudulent information in connection with any tax return.
7                 Likewise, under Federal law it is unlawful for a
8       person to willfully make any tax return, statement, or
9       other document that is fraudulent or false as to any
10       material matter or, that the person does not believe to be
11       true and correct as to every material matter.
12                 Under these Federal State and Local laws, such
13       conduct is unlawful, even if it does not result in the
14       underpayment of taxes.
15                 In order for you to find the Defendant guilty of
16       the crime of Falsifying Business Records in the First
17       Degree under Count 1, the People are required to prove,
18       from all of the evidence in the case, beyond a reasonable
19       doubt, each of the following two elements:

23       persons, made or caused a false entry in the business
24       records of an enterprise, specifically, an invoice from
25       Michael Cohen dated February 14, 2017, marked as a record
              The People's third theory of unlawful means,

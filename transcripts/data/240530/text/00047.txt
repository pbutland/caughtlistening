1 this time?
2 MR. BLANCHE: Yes .
3 We move for a Judgment of Acquittal and to set
4 aside the verdict for the reasons we previously stated.
5 Just to emphasize a few significant reasons that
6 came out since we made it: There's no basis and there's
7 no way this jury could have reached a verdict without
8 accepting the testimony of Mr. Cohen; and we believe
9 unequivocally that that testimony, even though it would
10 stand in this courtroom, that he lied, there was perjury
11 committed.
12 And there is no reason that the Court should
13 allow a verdict, knowing that one of the witnesses that,
14 necessarily, had to be part of the crime that was
15 committed and the offense should be used to convict
16 President Trump.
17 And so, for that reason, combined with the fact
18 that there was no evidence, certainly limited evidence
19 that had any —— any connection between the charged conduct
20 and President Trump, and the limited connection was
21 Michael Cohen, we believe in light of that fact, which I
22 don't think is in dispute, the Court should enter a
23 Judgment of Acquittal, notwithstanding the verdict.
24 THE COURT: I'm sure you misspoke when you said
25 "knowing".

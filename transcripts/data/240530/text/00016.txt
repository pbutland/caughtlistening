2                 If you are not convinced beyond a reasonable
3       doubt that the Defendant is guilty of a charged crime, you
4       must find the Defendant not guilty of that crime, and if
5       you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the
6       Defendant is guilty of a charged crime, you must find the
7       Defendant guilty of that crime.
8                 As judges of the facts, you alone determine the
9       truthfulness and accuracy of the testimony of each witness.
10                 You must decide whether a witness told the truth
11       and was accurate, or instead, testified falsely or was
12       mistaken.
13                 You must also decide what importance to give to
14       the testimony you accept as truthful and accurate.
15                 It is the quality of the testimony that is
16       controlling, not the number of witnesses who testified.
17                 If you find that any witness has intentionally
18       testified falsely as to any material fact, you may
19       disregard that witness's entire testimony, or you may
20       disregard so much of it as you find was untruthful and
21       accept so much of it as you find to have been truthful and
22       accurate.
23                 There is no particular formula for evaluating the
24       truthfulness and accuracy of another person's statements or
25       testimony.  You bring to this process all of your varied
    duty.

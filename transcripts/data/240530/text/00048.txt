1 Youâ€™re not suggesting that I "know" anybody
2 committed perjury; right?
3 MR. BLANCHE: Correct.
4 THE COURT: People?
5 MR. STEINGLASS: Very briefly, we, of course,
6 disagree with Mr. Blanche's characterization of Michael
7 Cohen's testimony.
8 For all the reasons set forth in the summation
9 and the entire trial record, there's more than enough
10 evidence in this case for a reasonable jury to have
11 reached the verdict that it did.
12 So, we urge your Honor to reject the Defense
13 motion.
14 THE COURT: Your motion is denied.
15 Any other motions or applications before we
16 adjourn the matter?
17 MR. BLANCHE: May we approach, briefly, your
18 Honor?
19 THE COURT: On the record.
20 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
21 at sidebarz)
22 MR. BLANCHE: I just wanted to ask about the
23 sentencing date and be heard on the date.
24 I didn't know what the Court's practice was.
25 THE COURT: Sure.

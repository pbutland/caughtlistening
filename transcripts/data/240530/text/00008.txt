Jury Deliberation - Re-charge
4917
1                 The testimony of the witnesses, the exhibits that
2       were received in evidence, and the stipulations agreed to
3       by the parties.
4                 Remember, a stipulation is information the
5       parties have agreed to present to the jury as evidence,
6       without calling a witness to testify.
7                 Testimony which was stricken from the record or
8       to which an objection was sustained must be disregarded by
9       you.
10                 Exhibits that were received in evidence are
11       available, upon your request, for your inspection and
12       consideration.
13                 Exhibits that were just seen during the trial, or
14       marked for identification but not received in evidence, are
15       not evidence, and are thus not available for your
16       inspection and consideration.
17                 Testimony based upon those exhibits that were not
18       received in evidence may be considered by you.
19                 In evaluating the evidence, you may consider any
20       fact that is proven and any inference which may be drawn
21       from such fact.
22                 To draw an inference means to infer, find,
23       conclude that a fact exists or does not exist based upon
24       proof of some other fact or facts.

1 clarification as to which exhibits were accepted into
2 evidence with limitations, just send me a note with your
3 question, and I will be happy to clarify.
4 We now turn to the fundamental principles of our
5 law that apply in all criminal trials: The presumption of
6 innocence, the burden of proof, and the requirement of
7 proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
8 Throughout these proceedings, the Defendant is
9 presumed to be innocent. As a result, you must find the
10 Defendant not guilty, unless, on the evidence presented at
11 this trial, you conclude that the People have proven the
12 Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
13 In determining whether the People have satisfied
14 their burden of proving the Defendant's guilt beyond a
15 reasonable doubt, you may consider all of the evidence
16 presented, whether by the People or by the Defendant.
17 In doing so, however, remember that even though
18 the Defendant introduced evidence, the burden of proof
19 remains on the People.
20 The fact that the Defendant did not testify is
21 not a factor from which any inference unfavorable to the
22 Defendant may be drawn.
23 The Defendant is not required to prove that he is
24 not guilty. In fact, the Defendant is not required to
25 prove or disprove anything.

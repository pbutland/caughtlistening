Jury Deliberation — Re—charge
4915
1 Okay. We have located that testimony, and we are
2 ready to read it back to you in just one moment.
3 You also sent us another note which was signed by
4 the Jury Foreperson at 3:51. It was marked as Court
5 Exhibit 5.
6 It says:
7 We, the jury, request to re—hear Judge's
8 instructions.
9 I then asked if you wanted to hear the entire set
10 of instruction or just a portion of it.
11 And this morning you gave us another note. That
12 note has been marked as Court Exhibit Number 6, and it is
13 signed by the Jury Foreperson at 9:32. And it says:
14 We, the jury, request that the read back of the
15 instructions begin with the description of how the jury
16 considers the evidence and what inferences can be drawn
17 from the facts, for example, the rain metaphor, through the
18 description of the law with respect to Count 1.
19 Did I read that correctly, Mr. Foreperson?
20 JURY FOREPERSON: Yes, sir.
21 THE COURT: So, Mr. Foreperson, should I assume
22 that you no longer need to deal with Court Exhibit Number
23 5, that this replaces Court Exhibit Number 5?
24 JURY FOREPERSON: Yes.
25 THE COURT: There was a second request on this

Jury Deliberation - Re-charge
4916
1       note, and that is:
2                 Whether or not we can be provided with headphones
3       with a 3.5 MM input jack for use of the evidence laptop.
4                 Did I read that correctly, Mr. Foreperson?
5                 JURY FOREPERSON:  Yes.
6                 THE COURT:  I am told that, yes, you can be
7       provided with such a headphone, but I am also told that you
8       can be provided with speakers that can be connected to the
9       laptop so that more than one person can listen to it at a
10       time.
11                 The choice is yours.  I am letting you know you
12       have the choice to make.  And just let me know later, send
13       me another note, you don't have to come back out, let me
14       know if you want the headphones or the speakers.
15                 Ordinarily, I read the notes in the order in
16       which they come out.  But I wanted to ask whether you
17       wanted the instructions read back first or you wanted the
18       read-back first?
19                 JURY FOREPERSON:  The instructions first, please,
20       your Honor.
21                 THE COURT:  Okay.
22                 So, the instructions will be Pages 6 through 35.
23                 When you judge the facts, you are to consider
24       only the evidence.
25                 The evidence in this case includes:

3 Intent means conscious objective or purpose.
4 Thus, a person acts with intent to defraud when
5 his or her conscious objective or purpose is to do so.
6 Intent does not require premeditation. In other
7 words, intent does not require advance planning. Nor is it
8 necessary that the intent be in a person’s mind for any
9 particular period of time.
10 The intent can be formed, and need only exist, at
11 the very moment the person engages in prohibited conduct or
12 acts to cause the prohibited result and not at any earlier
13 time.
14 The question naturally arises as to how to
15 determine whether a defendant had the intent required for
16 the commission of a crime.
17 To make that determination in this case, you must
18 decide if the required intent can be inferred beyond a
19 reasonable doubt from the proven facts.
20 In doing so, you may consider the person’s
21 conduct and all of the circumstances surrounding that
22 conduct, including, but not limited to, to the following:
23 What, if anything, did the person do or say?
24 What result, if any, followed the person’s
25 conduct?

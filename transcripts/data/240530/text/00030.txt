5       expenditure made in cooperation, consultation, or concert
6       with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or his
7       agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to such

10       anything of value, including, any purchase, payment, loan,
11       or advance, made by any person for the purpose of
12       influencing any election for Federal office.
13                 Under Federal law, a third party's payment of a
14       candidate's expenses is deemed to be a contribution to the
15       candidate unless the payment would have been made
16       irrespective of the candidacy.
17                 If the payment would have been made even in the
18       absence of the candidacy, the payment should not be treated
19       as a contribution.

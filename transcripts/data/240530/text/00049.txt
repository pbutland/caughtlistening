1            We can do that in open court.
2            MR. BLANCHE:  I didn't know the process.
3            THE COURT:  We can do that in open court.
4            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
5   in open court:)
6            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Blanche?
7            MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, we would ask for a date
8   for sentencing on some date in mid to late July.
9            The reason for that is, as the Court is aware,
10   President Trump faces other charges in other
11   jurisdictions.
12            In the case in Florida, there is a three-day
13   hearing scheduled for late June; and the work ahead of
14   that hearing requires Counsel to be in Florida, inside a
15   SCIF, for much of the time between now and the date of
16   hearing and, also, the date of the hearing itself, which
17   will require us to just not be able to focus on this
18   matter.
19            So, we, respectfully, request a date at some
20   point in mid to late July for sentence.
21            MR. STEINGLASS:  Judge, the standard adjournment
22   for an out I and S is six weeks.
23            So, we don't oppose a date in mid-July.
24            THE COURT:  We will adjourn this matter for
25   sentence to July 11th.

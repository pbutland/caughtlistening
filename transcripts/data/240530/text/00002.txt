Jury Deliberation — Re—charge
4911
1 Subsequent to that, I received another email
2 suggesting that if I was going to include one section, that
3 I should include another; and my position is that you
4 should as well.
5 Anything that either one of you would like to put
6 on the record regarding that?
7 MR. STEINGLASS: No thank you, Judge.
8 MR. BLANCHE: No, your Honor.
9 THE COURT: So, I think we are ready for the read
10 back.
11 We did receive another note that I would like to
12 put on the record. It's marked as Court Exhibit Number 6,
13 signed by the Jury Foreperson at 9:32 this morning, and it
14 says:
15 We, the jury, request:
16 First, that the read—back of the instructions
17 begin with the description of how the jury considers the
18 evidence and what inferences can be drawn from the facts,
19 example, rain metaphor, through the description of the law
20 with respect to Count 1.
21 As I see it, what they are asking then is for me
22 to begin on Page 7 and continue to Page 35.
23 MR. BLANCHE: We agree.
24 THE COURT: You agree?
25 MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

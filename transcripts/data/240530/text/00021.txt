2                 You have also heard testimony that a witness read
3       or reviewed certain materials pertaining to this case
4       before the witness testified at trial.  The law permits a
5       witness to do so.
6                 Speaking to a witness about his or her testimony
7       and permitting the witness to review materials pertaining
8       to the case before the witness testifies is a normal part
9       of preparing for trial.
10                 It is not improper as long as it is not suggested
11       that the witness depart from the truth.
12                 The People have the burden of proving beyond a
13       reasonable doubt, not only that a charged crime was
14       committed, but that the Defendant is the person who
15       committed that crime.
16                 Thus, even if you are convinced beyond a
17       reasonable doubt that a charged crime was committed by
18       someone, you cannot convict the Defendant of that crime
19       unless you are also convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
20       that he is the person who committed that crime.
21                 Under our law, Michael Cohen is an accomplice
22       because there is evidence that he participated in a crime
23       based upon conduct involved in the allegations here against
24       the Defendant.
25                 Our law is especially concerned about the
    be asked on cross-examination.

Jury Deliberation - Re-charge

1       favorable or unfavorable against either party, from the
2       fact that certain material has been redacted.
3                 You may recall that I instructed you several
4       times during the trial that certain exhibits were being
5       accepted into evidence for a limited purpose only, and that
6       you were not to consider that evidence for any other
7       purpose.
8                 Under the law we refer to that as a limiting
9       instruction.  I will now remind you of some of the limiting
10       instructions that you were given during the course of the
11       trial.
12                 You will recall that you heard testimony that
13       while David Pecker was an executive at AMI, AMI entered
14       into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Federal prosecutors,
15       as well as the Conciliation Agreement with the Federal
16       Election Commission, the FEC.  I remind you that evidence
17       was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David
18       Pecker's credibility and to help provide context for some
19       of the surrounding events.  You may consider that testimony
20       for those purposes only.
21                 Neither the Non-Prosecution Agreement, nor the
22       Conciliation Agreement is evidence of the Defendant's
23       guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether
24       the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged
25       crimes.

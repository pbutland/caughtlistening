3                 Under that definition, mere presence at the scene
4       of a crime, even with knowledge that the crime was taking
5       place, or mere association with a perpetrator of a crime,
6       does not by itself make a defendant criminally liable for
7       that crime.
8                 In order for the Defendant to be held criminally

23       Defendant, personally, had committed every act constituting
24       that crime.

1            We will order a Probation Report.
2            Mr. Blanche, the clerk of the court will give you
3   instructions on how to go about scheduling that Probation
4   interview and getting that Probation Report.
5            This will be July 11th, at 10:00 AM.
6            If there are going to be any motions filed, I
7   direct the Defense to file their motions no later than
8   June 13th. That would be two weeks from today.
9            If any motions are filed by that date, the People
10   are directed to respond by June 27th.
11            And that's the parameter of time that the Court
12   would have to decide any motions.
13            If there's nothing else, you're excused.
14            Thank you very much.
15            MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
16            THE COURT:  What is the current bail status?
17            MR. STEINGLASS:  There is no bail.
18            THE COURT:  Mr. Trump remains ROR'd.
19            (Whereupon, the case is adjourned for sentence to
20   July 11th, 2024 at 10:00 A.M.)

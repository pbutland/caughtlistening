5                 Therefore, our law provides that a defendant may
6       not be convicted of any crime upon the testimony of an

11       Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the

13       that it was corroborated by other evidence tending to
14       connect the Defendant with the commission of the crime.
15                 The corroborative evidence need not, by itself,
16       prove that a crime was committed or that the Defendant is
17       guilty.  What the law requires is that there be evidence
18       that tends to connect the Defendant with the commission of
19       the crime charged in such a way as may reasonably satisfy
20       you that the accomplice is telling the truth about the
21       Defendant's participation in that crime.

23       corroboration, you may consider whether there is material,
24       believable evidence, apart from the testimony of Michael
25       Cohen, which itself tends to connect the Defendant to the
    testimony of an accomplice who implicates another in the

1 I want you to know that those admonitions no
2 longer apply.
3 You are free to discuss the case with anyone you
4 would like to discuss it with, but you're also free not
5 to. No one can make you do anything that you don't want to
6 do. The choice is yours.
7 In a few minutes, if it's okay with you, I would
8 like to meet with you in the jury room, just to thank you
9 personally for your work.
10 Bear in mind, I'm not allowed to discuss the
11 facts of the case. I'm also not permitted to discuss your
12 deliberations.
13 But, I do want to personally thank you for your
14 service, and I'd also like to get your feedback, get a
15 sense of what we did right, what we did wrong.
16 There are a couple of matters I need to take care
17 of here. I'll do that quickly so I can join you in the
18 back.
19 At this time, 1 thank you very much.
20 You're excused with the gratitude of the Court.
21 (Whereupon, the jurors are excused and discharged
22 at 5:11 PM and exit the courtroom, and the alternate
23 jurors are excused and discharged and exit the courtroom.)
24 THE COURT: You may be seated.
25 Any motions, applications, anything to go over at

3 all of which were processed through the defendant's company,
4 the Trump Organization, and they disguised what the payments
5 were for.
6 The defendant said in his business records that he
7 was paying Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer
8 agreement.
9 But, those were lies. There was no retainer
10 agreement.
11 Cohen was not being paid for legal services. The
12 defendant was paying him back for an illegal payment to
13 Stormy Daniels on the eve of the election.
14 The defendant falsified those business records
15 because he wanted to conceal his and others' criminal
16 conduct.
17 In total, the defendant falsified 34 business
18 records to cover up that criminal conspiracy.
19 As a result of his conduct, the defendant was
20 indicted by a Grand Jury in Manhattan on 34 counts of
21 falsifying business records.
22 And the first count of that indictment reads:
23 The Grand Jury of the County of New York, by this
24 indictment, accuses the defendant of the crime of Falsifying
25 Business Records in the First Degree in violation of Penal

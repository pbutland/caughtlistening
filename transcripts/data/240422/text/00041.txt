Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo

1    then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his
2   New York business records over and over and over again.
3            In June of 2015, Donald Trump announced his
4   candidacy for president in the 2016 election; a few months
5   later this conspiracy began.
6            He invited his friend, David Pecker, to a meeting
7   at Trump Tower here in Manhattan.
8            Mr. Pecker was the CEO of a media company that,
9   among other things, owned and published the National
10   Enquirer tabloid.
11            Michael Cohen was also at that meeting.  He worked
12   for the defendant as the defendant's special counsel at his
13   company, the Trump Organization.
14            And those three men formed a conspiracy at that
15   meeting to influence the presidential election by concealing
16   negative information about Mr. Trump in order to help him
17   get elected.
18            As one part of that agreement, Michael Cohen paid
19   $130,000 to an adult film actress named Stormy Daniels just
20   a couple of weeks before the 2016 election to silence her
21   and to make sure the public did not learn of the sexual
22   encounter with the defendant.
23            Cohen made that payment at the defendant's
24   direction, and he did it to influence the presidential
25   election.

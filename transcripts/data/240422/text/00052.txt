Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 869
1   publicize her accounts of her affair with Trump before the
2   2016 election.
3            David Pecker will also testify that $150,000 was
4   way more than AMI would ordinarily pay for this type of
5   story.
6            But he discussed it directly with Donald Trump and
7   he discussed it with Michael Cohen, and he agreed to the
8   deal on the understanding that Trump was going to find a way
9   to pay AMI back.
10            You will hear David Pecker testify about his
11   conversations with Donald Trump about the McDougal payoff.
12             And three months before Election Day, AMI and
13   McDougal signed that deal.
14            But as the weeks dragged on and the defendant
15   hadn't yet made good on his agreement to pay AMI back,
16   Pecker started getting antsy, and he was frustrated, and he
17   said so to Michael Cohen.
18            So to show Pecker that Trump really did plan to pay
19   AMI back for the McDougal payoff, Cohen used his cell phone
20   to record a conversation with Donald Trump in September of
21   2016.
22            You will get a chance to hear that recording during
23   this trial.
24            On that tape, Cohen tells the defendant that he
25   will create a company to buy up McDougal's story from AMI.

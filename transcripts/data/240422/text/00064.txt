Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo

1   described, showing how they converted the $130,000 payoff
2   amount to the 420 grand that Cohen was going to get paid
3   back, as a grossed up way to disguise it, not as a
4   reimbursement, but as income.
5            Cohen and Weisselberg then met with Trump, who
6   approved that repayment amount of 420 grand on the $130,000
7   Stormy Daniels payment and a few others expenses.
8            Now, you will see evidence at trial that Donald
9   Trump was a very frugal businessman.  He believed in
10   pinching pennies.  He believed in watching every dollar. He
11   believed in negotiating every bill.
12            It's all over all of the books he has written.
13            He ran the Trump Organization with total control.
14             You will hear testimony about his relentless focus
15   on the bottom line.
16            But when it came time to pay Michael Cohen back for
17   the catch-and-kill deal, you will see that he didn't
18   negotiate the price down; he doubled it.
19            And he doubled it so they could disguise it as
20   income.
21            And you will hear evidence that the Trump
22   Organization was not in the practice of paying people twice
23   what they owed for anything.
24            This might be the only time that ever happened.
25             And Donald Trump's willingness to do so here shows

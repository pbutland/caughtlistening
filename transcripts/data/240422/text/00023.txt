1                 In determining whether the People have proven the
2       defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you should be
3       guided solely by a full and fair evaluation of the
4       evidence.
5                 After carefully evaluating the evidence, each of
6       you must decide whether that evidence convinces you beyond
7       a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt.
8                 Whatever your verdict may be, it must not rest on
9       baseless speculation nor may it by influenced in any way by
10       bias, prejudice, sympathy or by a desire to bring an end to
11       your deliberations or to avoid an unpleasant duty.

13       reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the
14       charged crime, you must find the defendant not guilty of
15       the crime.  And if you are convinced beyond a reasonable
16       doubt that the defendant is guilty of a charged crime, you
17       must find the defendant guilty of that crime.

19       first examined, that is they are asked questions by the
20       lawyer who calls the witness to testify, that is called
21       direct examination.
22                 When the direct examination is completed, the
23       other lawyer is permitted to ask questions of the witness
24       and that is called cross-examination.

1       everything on the record.
2                 I understand that you called on Friday to express
3       some concerns.
4                 Do you want to talk about this?
5                 SWORN JUROR:  Yeah, I calmed down now.  It was as
6       soon as I left on Thursday people were figuring out it was
7       me based on what was released.
8                 I was a little concerned that it was posted that
9       I live by myself.  I am a girl that lives by myself.  So I

18                 SWORN JUROR:  I feel better today.  I feel
19       grounded.  I, obviously, the gravity kind of set in and I
20       just hope that I can continue to stay as anonymous as
21       possible.
22                 I live by myself.  It was posted that I live by
23       myself.  I had concerns if my name were ever to get out
24       there, obviously, that poses a safety risk to me and that
25       was really my biggest concern, if anyone ever figured out

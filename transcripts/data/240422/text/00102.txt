1 Q. And without giving us the beginning portion of those
2 email addresses, did they end with the domain name AMIlink.com?
3 A. Yes, they did.
4 Q. Now, why did you have two separate email addresses at
5 AMIlink.com?
6 A. Well, the reason being, I would receive hundreds of
7 emails a day and I had my assistants look at all of my emails
8 to vet out which ones I should look at right away, which ones
9 were important or not.
10 I also had a second email address which was private
11 because I would receive emails from the Human Resources
12 Department on salaries and raises and compensation, or sometimes
13 other sensitive issues which I didn't want my assistants to see,
14 so I had two.
15 Q. So without giving us the exact name of those email
16 addresses, is it fair to say you had one kind for general
17 purposes and one for purposes that you didn't want other people
18 to have access to?
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. And in addition to H.R. matters, like salary, did you
21 also sometimes use the more restrictive email address when you
22 were dealing with sensitive subjects or sources?
23 A. Yes, for confidential I would.
24 Q. Are you here today pursuant to a subpoena?
25 A. Yes, I am.

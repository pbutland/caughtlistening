Jury Instructions - the Court
Page 852
1   from experience I know delays are inevitable for a multitude
2   of reasons, through no one's deliberate fault.
3            When those delays occur, I ask for your
4   understanding and your patience.
5            I assure you your time is important to me.  I never
6   take it for granted, and I never want to waste it.
7            I request that you please be here at the times I
8   set so that the absence or lateness of a juror is not the
9   occasion for delay.
10            If an emergency arises that may make you late or
11   prevent you from attending, please call the Court, leave a
12   number where you can be reached and explain the problem so
13   we can minimize everyone's inconvenience.
14            In this case, we have six alternate jurors.
15            An alternate juror is expected to pay the same
16   close attention to the case as any one of the first 12
17   jurors.
18            The only difference between an alternate juror and
19   one of the first 12 jurors is that the alternate juror does
20   not know whether that juror will be called upon at some
21   point during the trial to substitute for one of the 12
22   jurors.
23            That substitution could take place only if some
24   presently unforeseen extraordinary emergency arises that
25   makes it totally impossible for one of the first 12 jurors

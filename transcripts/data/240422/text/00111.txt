1        come up during the testimony of Mr. Pecker.  We thought we
2        could raise them now if the Court has the time.
3                 THE COURT:  Sure.
4                 MR. BOVE:  One relates to the issue with the
5        limiting instruction that the Court distributed this
6        morning relating to Mr. Cohen.  I think it's likely a
7        similar issue will present itself during the testimony of
8        Mr. Pecker, and in particular with respect to AMI's
9        resolution with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
10        District of New York.  We think the same limiting
11        instruction, you know, modified to change out Mr. Cohen and
12        to add AMI is appropriate.  We will ask for that at the
13        right time.
14                 MR. STEINGLASS:  That's reasonable.
15                 THE COURT:  Is the email instruction that I
16        drafted, is that acceptable?
17                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, we think it would need to be
18        modified slightly.  If we can take some time this afternoon
19        to make a proposal to the Court.
20                 THE COURT:  I would ask both sides to submit new
21        proposals.  Please get it to me by this afternoon.
22                 MR. BOVE:  The next issue relates to the potential
23        for testimony about polygraphs administered to Mr. Sajudin.
24        I think he may be the only one.  The Court ruled in limine
25        that evidence relating to the polygraph administered to

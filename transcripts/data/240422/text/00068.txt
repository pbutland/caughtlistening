Opening Statement â€” Mr. Colangelo

1 get you to reject his testimony precisely because it is so
2 damming.
3 You will learn, and we will be very upfront about
4 it, the fact that Michael Cohen, like other witnesses in
5 this trial, has made mistakes in his past.
6 For example, Cohen will tell you that when the
7 truth about the payoff to Stormy Daniels first began to come
8 to light in 2018, he lied.
9 He lied about it to protect his boss.
10 You will also learn that Michael Cohen has a
11 criminal record.
12 He will testify that in April 2018, the FBI raided
13 his residences and his office as part of an investigation
14 that included potential violations of federal campaign
15 finance law.
16 Cohen will also testify in this trial that he
17 ultimately pled guilty and went to jail for causing an
18 unlawful corporate contribution in connection with the Karen
19 McDougal payments and for making an excessive campaign
20 contribution in connection with the Stormy Daniels payoff.

2                 After the People have completed the presentation
3       of their evidence, the defendant may, but is not required,
4       to present evidence.
5                 I remind you that throughout these proceedings
6       the defendant is presumed to be innocent.  As a result, you
7       must find the defendant not guilty unless on the evidence
8       presented at this trial you conclude that the People have
9       proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
10                 That a defendant does not testify as a witness is
11       not a fact from which any inference unfavorable to the

13       prove that he is not guilty.  In fact, the defendant is not
14       required to prove or disprove anything.
15                 To the contrary, the People have the burden of
16       proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
17       That means before you can find the defendant guilty of a
18       crime, the People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
19       every element of the crime, including that the defendant is
20       the person who committed that crime.
21                 The burden of proof never shifts from the People
22       to the defendant.
23                 If the People fail to satisfy their burden of
24       proof, you must find the defendant not guilty, and if the
25       People satisfy their burden of proof, you must find the

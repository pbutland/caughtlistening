1   description of a retainer.
2            The accounting staff then prepared checks that each
3   included the description retainer.
4            The checks were stapled to the bogus invoices for
5   approval and signature.
6            The first two checks were paid from a trust the
7   defendant had created called the Donald J. Trump Revocable
8   Trust, which held all of the Trump Organization's assets
9   after he became president.
10            The defendant was the beneficiary of that trust.
11             Each of the remaining checks that were issued over
12   the course of 2017 were paid from the defendant's own bank
13   accounts.
14            And the defendant signed those checks, each of them
15   himself, while he was president.
16            And the Trump Organization maintained all of those
17   records, the false invoices, the vouchers with false
18   entries, the checks with check stubs with false entries at
19   Trump Tower here in Manhattan.
20            And with the final payment in December of 2017,
21   the defendant had repaid Cohen the full $420,000 they had
22   agreed upon, and the monthly payments stopped.
23            Now, during this trial you will hear a lot about
24   Michael Cohen.
25            I suspect the defense will go to great lengths to

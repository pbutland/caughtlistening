Jury Instructions - the Court
Page 851
1   Justice requires no less.
2            Under our law, Juror Number 1 will serve as the
3   jury's foreperson.
4            During the trial, the foreperson has the same
5   responsibilities as any other juror.
6            During deliberations, the foreperson will sign any
7   note that the jury sends to me, including that the jury has
8   reached a verdict.  The foreperson will announce the jury's
9   verdict.
10            Thus, in sum, the stages of the criminal trial are
11   the opening statements, the presentation of evidence,
12   summations, the final instructions of the Court to the jury
13   on the law, and the deliberation of the jury and the
14   verdict.
15            During the trial, if you need to speak with me
16   about something relating to your jury service or the trial,
17   please tell a court officer that you need to speak to me.
18            I will then arrange a meeting with the parties, in
19   the courtroom or in my robing room.
20            Do not discuss with your fellow jurors whatever you
21   feel necessary to bring to my attention.
22            And after we have had our conversation, do not
23   discuss with your fellow jurors whatever it is that we
24   discussed.
25            During the trial we do our best to avoid delay, but

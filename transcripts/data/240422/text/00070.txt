Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 887
1   conceal that illegal election fraud.
2            At the end of the case, we are confident that you
3   will have no reasonable doubt that Donald Trump is guilty
4   of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal
5   an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a
6   presidential election.
7            And as you credit all of the evidence the People
8   will present, we ask you to use your common sense, look
9   past any distractions, look past any irrelevant sideshows
10   that may pop up during this trial. Tune out the noise.
11   Focus on the facts. Focus on the logical inferences that
12   follow from those facts. Focus on the evidence. Listen to
13   the testimony. Read the documents, the emails, the text
14   messages, the bank statements, the handwritten notes, all
15   of it.
16            And, after all of that evidence is in, we'll have
17   a chance to speak to you again during closing arguments.
18   My colleague, Joshua Steinglass, will go through all of
19   that evidence and explain that it, inescapably, leads to
20   only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts
21   of falsifying business records in the first degree.
22            THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Colangelo.
23            Counsel.
24            MR. BLANCHE:  Good morning.
25            Good morning, Your Honor.

1   are made; they take place at every trial.
2            A lawyer may object before a witness answers a
3   question or after a witness answers a question.
4            When an objection is made to a question before the
5   witness answers, if I overrule the objection, the witness
6   will be permitted to answer.
7            If I sustain the objection, there is no answer and,
8   therefore, no evidence.
9            Remember, a question alone is not evidence.
10            If a lawyer objects after the witness has answered
11   the question and I overrule the objection, the answer stands
12   as evidence.
13            If I explain the objection, the answer is not
14   evidence.
15            The question and answer is stricken from the
16   record, and you are to completely disregard that answer as
17   though it were never said.
18            Also, the Court has an obligation under the laws
19   of New York to make sure that fundamental rules are
20   followed, even if one of the lawyers does not actually voice
21   an objection.
22            So, on occasion, you may hear me say sustained or
23   words to that effect, even though no one has actually
24   objected.

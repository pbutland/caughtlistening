1   evidence will show turned the rest of the presidential

3            On October 7th, 2016, The Post published a video of
4   Donald Trump, caught on a hot mic on the set of a television
5   show called Access Hollywood.
6            He didn't know he was being taped.
7            And you will see an email that the Washington Post
8   reporter emailed to the campaign's press secretary, Hope
9   Hicks, a few hours before the story ran.
10            And they sent her a transcript of the Access
11   Hollywood tape.
12            And the transcript depicts Donald Trump bragging
13   about sexual assault.
14            It shows, it depicts, and I'm quoting the
15   defendant's words from the transcript that you will see in

18   magnet, just kiss, I don't even wait, when you are a star
19   they let you do it, you can do anything, grab them by the
20   pussy, you can do anything."  End quote.

22   released one month before Election Day.
23            And the impact of that tape on the campaign was
24   immediate and explosive.

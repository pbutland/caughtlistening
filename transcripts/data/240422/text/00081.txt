1            Again, entering into an agreement with another
2   individual -- you'll hear this agreement was negotiated by
3   lawyers.
4            MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
5            THE COURT:  Please approach.
6            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
7   at sidebar:)
8            THE COURT:  Tell me what the objection is.
9            MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor specifically excluded
10   presence of counsel defense.
11            MR. BLANCHE:  Sorry, Your Honor.
12            There will be testimony from Mr. Cohen that he
13   was a lawyer, and there will be testimony he was working
14   with Mr. Davidson, also a lawyer.
15            THE COURT:  I'll direct you stay away from it.
16            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
17            So, it is true that in their opening, the People
18   talked about how Mr. Pecker is going to talk about his
19   communications with the General Counsel as well, which is
20   also the same issue.
21            THE COURT:  Mr. Pecker is not on trial here.
22            MR. BLANCHE:  I understand.
23            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
24   in open court:)
25            THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.

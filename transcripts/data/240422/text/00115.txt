1 MR. STEINGLASS: This is a short issue. We can
2 address evidentiary issues when they arise, but I don't
3 believe there is a requirement that in order to be a
4 business record that the witness be a party to the
5 communications. So, like I said, we could address these
6 issues when they arise.
7 MR. BOVE: Just to clarify the issue, the
8 government can lay a foundation that a text message between
9 Mr. Howard and a third party comes in as a business record.
10 That text message communication is a business record.
11 There's still an embedded hearsay issue with respect to the
12 factual assertions in the text messages coming in for the
13 truth or not. That is the issue that is more tricky and
14 requires more analysis. The business record foundation
15 doesn't alleviate that issue.
16 My point is, when Mr. Pecker is on the stand, if
17 all that is going to be happening, communications are going
18 to be coming into evidence based on the business records
19 foundation, and some would be displayed to the jury when
20 Mr. Pecker is a party, I don't think that is complicated.
21 On the other hand, if the government contemplates
22 putting in text messages from Mr. Howard to third parties
23 who have not testified yet and may not testify, and to
24 display them to illustrate a narrative during the
25 testimony of Mr. Pecker, that would be much more

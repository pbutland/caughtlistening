7 Q. And forgive me for asking this question, I know it's a

9 A. Yes.
10 As an editor of a tabloid magazine, you develop over
11 the years a group of sources, and the sources might be people
12 who work in hotels, people who work for lawyers, people who
13 work for various different aspects of a celebrity. A celebrity
14 might be using like, for example, a limousine service. We
15 develop sources. And that's really what makes a celebrity
16 reporter or celebrity editor or celebrity Editor—in—Chief. It's
17 important how valid their sources are, and they build this
18 entire source network.

Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche
Page 908
1 couple of days —— well, listen to the whole trial, but
2 certainly over the next couple of days when you hear
3 Mr. Pecker testify about this supposed catch and kill.
4 Listen to what he says about his motivation to sell
5 magazines, not surprising, and whether it really is a
6 catch and kill, and whether what the People just told you
7 lines up with what the witness is going to say on that
8 stand.
9 So, I’m going to sit down.
10 Before I do, I am going to say the same thing
11 that the People said to you. Please listen to the
12 evidence. Listen to the testimony. Listen to the testimony
13 of Michael Cohen. Listen to the communications that folks
14 had, the meetings that people had, 2015, 2016, 2017, years
15 and years ago. And think about whether it rings true that
16 what they're saying is accurate and lines up with the
17 other evidence that you hear.
18 Listen to the folks that still work at Trump
19 Tower, some of them, about what they did when they got
20 those various documents that make up the 34 counts. Listen
21 about whether that has anything to do with President Trump
22 or anything to do with AMI or a catch and kill scheme or
23 the 2016 election.
24 If you do that, I submit that you will reach the
25 conclusion that it does not.

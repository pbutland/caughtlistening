1        referring to, consult with the prosecution, see what you
2        can sort out, and then come to me with anything that you
3        can't come to an agreement on.
4                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you.  And we will.
5                 Just on the timing issue, we want to use your
6        Honor's time efficiently, but, I think, as the Court is
7        aware, we learned that Mr. Pecker would be called as a
8        witness yesterday at about 3.
9                 THE COURT:  I am not aware of what time it was.
10                 MR. BOVE:  That's the first time the government
11        told us about it.
12                 THE COURT:  Anything else from the defense?
13                 MR. BOVE:  No, your Honor.
14                 Thank you.
15                 THE COURT:  From the People?
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  No.  Thank you, Judge.
17                 THE COURT:  Is there anything else that you would
18        like to submit or you would like me to consider before we
19        have our hearing tomorrow at 9:30?
20                 MR. BOVE:  Just on the contempt motion?
21                 THE COURT:  Yes.
22                 MR. BOVE:  No, your Honor.
23                 Thank you.
24                 MR. CONROY:  Nothing additional at this point.
25        Can we approach for a moment on that?

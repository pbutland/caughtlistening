Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 870
1              Cohen tells the defendant that he spoke to Allen
2   Weisselberg, who is the Trump Organization Chief Financial
3   Officer, about how to set the whole thing up.
4            And on that recording, you will hear the defendant
5   in his own voice.
6            You will hear him ask Cohen:  So what do we got to
7   the pay for this?  One-fifty?
8            You will even hear Mr. Trump suggest in his own
9   voice, you will hear him suggest paying in cash.
10            After that conversation, Cohen then proceeded to
11   set up a shell company for the transfer.
12            It was less than six weeks to Election Day, and
13   Cohen then worked out a deal with David Pecker for AMI to
14   sell its rights to the McDougal story to Cohen's shell
15   company.  That way AMI could get paid back and Trump would
16   then own the rights to the McDougal story.
17            Just as Cohen was doing, Pecker also used a
18   middleman to hide the true nature of the transaction.
19            He agreed to have another company put together a
20   fake invoice billing Cohen's shell company for so-called
21   advisory services.
22            Trump would become the new owner of Ms. McDougal's
23   story, but to any observer looking at those records neither
24   Pecker nor Trump would even appear as parties to the
25   transaction.

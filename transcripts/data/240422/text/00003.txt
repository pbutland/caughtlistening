1                 We can either -- we can do it in my chambers.  I
2       am sorry, in my robing room and I will ask the court
3       reporter to come in.
4                 Your client has waived Antommarchi, right?
5                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
6                 THE COURT:  If possible, I would ask that not
7       every single one of your colleagues come in with us, just
8       one or two, find out what the issue is and see if this
9       juror can continue to serve.
10                 (THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN JUDGE
11       MERCHAN'S ROBING ROOM.)
12                 THE COURT:  Let the record reflect, we are in the
13       robing room.  Mr. Bove, Ms. Necheles, Ms. Hoffinger, Mr.
14       Steinglass and Mr. Blanche are present.
15                 I would ask those of you who can sit, please sit,

17       another chair here, maybe Mr. Bove can sit in that chair
18       there and then we can bring the juror in and she can stand.
19                 SERGEANT:  Would like me to shut the door?
20                 THE COURT:  When she comes in, yes.
21                 SERGEANT:  Juror entering.
22                      (Whereupon, juror number nine entered the
23                 robing room.)
24                 THE COURT:  Good morning.
25                 I apologize for all of this.  We need to do

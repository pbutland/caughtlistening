Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 857
1            We tried to contact all of you to let you know that
2   we would be working through lunch today and ending at 2:00,
3   so that you wouldn't be surprised when you got here.
4            There is a slight change today, and we are only
5   going to be working until 12:30 only today.
6            Tomorrow we are going to start at 11.  Once again,
7   we are going to work through lunch, and we will end the day
8   at 2:00.
9            Wednesday is my calendar day, so we cannot meet on
10   Wednesdays.
11            We will work all day Thursday, Friday.
12            And then Monday and Tuesday next week we will be
13   back to working through lunch until 2:00 because of the
14   holiday.
15            After that, we should settle into a much more
16   normal routine of 9:30 to 4:30.
17            Having concluded my preliminary instructions, I
18   will now ask the People to deliver their opening statement.
19             People.
20            MR. COLANGELO:  Good morning, your Honor, counsel,
21   members of the jury.
22            This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a
23   cover-up.
24            The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a
25   criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election;

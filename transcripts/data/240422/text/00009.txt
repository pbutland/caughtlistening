Jury Trial - Preliminaries/Sandoval Ruling
Page 826
1                 The Court has considered many relevant factors
2       and balanced the prejudice to the defendant against his
3       willingness to advance his own self interest in reaching
4       the Sandoval compromise.
5                 The operative standard is familiar and,
6       therefore, briefly repeated.  It is well settled that the
7       scope and content of cross-examination rests within the
8       sound discretion of the trial judge.  That's People v.
9       Sandoval, 34 New York 2d 371, 1974.
10                 The Court in exercising its discretion prior to
11       trial may limit the People's use of the defendant's history
12       of criminal, vicious and immoral acts to impeach the
13       defendant with cross-examination.  Sandoval at 373.
14                 The Judge balances the act's probative value on
15       questioning the defendant's credibility against the risk of
16       unfair prejudice resulting from their admission.  Sandoval
17       at 375.
18                 There is no precise formula in determining which
19       prior acts are appropriate impeachment material.  People v
20       Walker, 83 New York 2d 455, 1994.
21                 The trial court's analysis is not bound by the
22       age, nature or number of defendant's prior crimes.  People
23       v. Gray, 84 New York 2d 713.
24                 A defendant can even be impeached with prior acts
25       or prior bad acts that did not result in a criminal charge

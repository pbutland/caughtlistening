1       the prosecutor will proceed with the presentation of
2       evidence.
3                 I remind you that the indictment is not evidence.
4       It is simply a document that contains an accusation.  The
5       defendant has pled not guilty to those accusations and a
6       trial is for you to hear the evidence and decide whether
7       the defendant is guilty, or not guilty.
8                 I remind you also that evidence is the testimony
9       of witnesses, the stipulations, if any, that are agreed to
10       by the parties and documents or other physical objects
11       which are received in evidence.  Testimony is, of course,

14       the Court.
15                 A question by itself is not evidence.  It is the
16       question with the answer that is evidence.
17                 Sometimes a question will assume, for example,
18       sometimes a question will assume something to be true.
19                 You are not, however, to conclude that an
20       assumption in a question is true unless the answer in your
21       judgment confirms it to be true.  So you must consider the
22       question and the witness' answer and decide whether you
23       find the answer believable and accurate.  Because, again,
24       it is the question with the answer that is the evidence.

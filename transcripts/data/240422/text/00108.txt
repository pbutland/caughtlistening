5 THE COURT: All right.
6 As you know, tomorrow morning we're going to have
7 our hearing at 9:30. If for some reason we're not done by
8 11, I expect that we will be, we'll pause it at that point
9 and we'll deal with the jury and then pick it back up after
10 that.
11 MR. STETNGLASS: Can we approach on scheduling
12 matters?
13 (whereupon, a sidebar took place between the court
14 and counsel:)
15 MR. STETNGLASS: So I think you told the jury that
16 we were working on Monday, but I thought the Court had
17 asked ——
18 THE COURT: Yes, I will correct that.
19 MR. STETNGLASS: That was number one.
20 Number two, I think you might have also said we
21 were breaking early on Tuesday, the 30th. I am not sure
22 that anyone is asking for that. My understanding is Mr.
23 Stern isn't coming in that day at all.
24 MS. NECHELES: There is no seder.
25 THE COURT: We can work all day. I will advise

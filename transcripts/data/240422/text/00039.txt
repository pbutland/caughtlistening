1 the evidence, in light of what you see, you become a
2 witness, not a juror.

7 listen to any news accounts or posts of the case and that
8 you not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related
9 to the case.
10 Your decision must be based solely on the testimony
11 and other evidence presented in this courtroom.
12 It would not be fair to the parties for you to base
13 your decision on a reporter's view or opinion or upon
14 information that you acquire out of the courtroom.
15 These rules are designed to help guarantee a fair
16 trial, and a violation of any of these rules can jeopardize
17 the integrity of these proceedings.
18 Accordingly, our law sets forth serious
19 consequences if the rules are not followed.
20 I trust you understand and appreciate the
21 importance of following these rules.
22 And in accordance with your ultimate promise, I
23 know you promise to do so.
24 Before we begin with the opening statement, I know
25 we briefly discussed scheduling.

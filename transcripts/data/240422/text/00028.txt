2            THE COURT:  With some exceptions, what a witness
3   may have been thinking when something has taken place is not
4   relevant evidence.
5            Finally, a witness is often not permitted to
6   testify to hearsay, meaning generally that a witness cannot
7   testify to what the witness may have said before the trial,
8   or what another person may have said to that witness before
9   the trial.
10            But there are many exceptions to the hearsay rule
11   for a variety of sound reasons, too numerous to go into at
12   this time.
13            I will, however, explain a couple of exceptions
14   that frequently arise during a trial.
15            Sometimes, a witness will be permitted to testify
16   that the witness did something because of what someone said
17   in that circumstance.
18            It does not matter who uttered the statement or how
19   the speaker gathered the information for the statement, or
20   even whether the statement is truthful and accurate.
21            It matters only that someone uttered the words and
22   the witness did something upon hearing those words.
23            So in that instance you may not consider what the
24   witness was told for the truth of the words said to the
25   witness.  You may consider the words only for the reason

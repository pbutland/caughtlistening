1       A.   The same title, Chairman, President and CEO.
2       Q.   And can you describe a little bit for the jury what
3   your responsibilities were in those titles?
4       A.   In a publishing environment you have multiple different
5   departments.
6            On the editorial side, you have Editor-in-Chief, and
7   you have the staff, managing editors, freelancers, reporters.
8            And an on the operations side, you have various
9   different departments; accounting department, finance
10   department, and you have a legal department, Human Resources
11   Administration.  All those departments reported to the directors
12   of each of those units that I just mentioned, and that is the
13   leadership team.
14            And everybody, all those people, reported directly to
15   me.
16       Q.   So as CEO and President and Chairman, did you have the
17   final say over publishing decisions, including which stories
18   would get published and which stories would not get published?
19       A.   Yes, I had the final say.
20            On the celebrity side of the magazine industry, at
21   least on the tabloid side, we used checkbook journalism and we
22   pay for stories.  So I gave a number to the editors that they
23   could not spend more than $10,000 to investigate or produce or
24   publish a story.  So anything over $10,000 that they would spend
25   on a story, that would have to be vetted and brought up to me if

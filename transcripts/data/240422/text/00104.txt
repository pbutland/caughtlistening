1 what Dylan Howard's roles were in each of those two jobs. I
2 know you said he had a lot of jobs, but the two that I'm asking
3 about in particular, being Editor—in—Chief of the National
4 Enquirer and kind of being the Editor—in—Chief of all the AMI
5 publications, the Chief Content Officer?
6 A. The difference about celebrity magazines versus other
7 magazines, these celebrity or tabloids are all weekly. So
8 they're all weeklies. The editor, as Dylan, would receive, as I
9 call it, his report card every week based on what the sales
10 would be. So you would know immediately whatever decision Dylan
11 made or we made for the cover of the magazine, you would
12 immediately see what the sales were. If it was a mistake, you
13 didn't do it again. That's one.
14 The other piece, the other portion of the job is, all
15 of the sources, freelancers, editors, photographers, writers,
16 all reported up to different department heads, but they all
17 ended up reporting to Dylan.
18 Q. As Chief Content Officer?
19 A. As Chief Content Officer.
20 Q. Now —— withdrawn.
21 So is it fair to say that Dylan Howard kind of ran the
22 network of sources for AMI, all of AMI's publications?
23 A. Yes, because his job was to make sure that we would
24 have the most exclusive and current content.
25 Q. Now, when it came to —— I don't know how to say this,

Opening Statement â€” Mr. Colangelo

1 But, as Judge Merchan told you, the indictment is
2 not evidence.
3 So, let's talk about what the evidence will be.
4 It starts with that August 2015 meeting in Trump
5 Tower.
6 The defendant had just announced that he was
7 running for president.
8 And he asked David Pecker to come to Trump Tower to
9 talk.
10 At the time, David Pecker was the chairman and CEO
11 of a major media company called American Media, Incorporated
12 or AMI.
13 AMI owned and published celebrity magazines, health
14 and fitness magazines, and supermarket tabloids like the
15 National Enquirer.
16 As the man in charge of AMI, Pecker had the
17 ultimate say over publication decisions. He had the say
18 over what stories to publish or not publish in any of AMI's
19 magazines or tabloids.
20 And Trump and Pecker were joined at that meeting by
21 Michael Cohen, who, as I mentioned, worked for the defendant
22 at the Trump Organization and served as special counsel to
23 the defendant.
24 Now, Cohen's job, really, was to take care of
25 problems for the defendant.

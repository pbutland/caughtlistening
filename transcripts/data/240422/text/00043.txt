1   Law Section 175.10, committed as follows:
2            The defendant, in the County of New York and
3   elsewhere, on or about February 14th, 2017, with intent to
4   defraud and intent to commit or conceal another crime and to
5   aid and conceal the commission thereof, made and caused a
6   false entry in the business records of an enterprise, to
7   wit: An invoice from Michael Cohen, dated February 14th,
8   2017, marked as a record of the Donald J. Trump Revocable
9   Trust and kept and maintained by the Trump Organization.
10            Now, the remaining 33 counts in this indictment
11   detail the rest of the false business records charges for
12   each monthly payment.
13            The fraudulent cover-up scheme involved falsifying
14   three different types of business records:  An invoice,
15   falsely describing a request for payment for legal services
16   rendered in a given month; a voucher entry in the Trump
17   Organization's general ledger system falsely describing the
18   payment as one for legal services; and payment checks with
19   check stubs that also falsely describe the nature and
20   payments.
21            All in all, the defendant disguised his payments to
22   Michael Cohen through 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified
23   ledger entries and 11 falsified checks for a total of 34
24   false business records in the books and records of his
25   company, the Trump Organization.

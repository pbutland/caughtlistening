Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 874
1   Editor-in-Chief, told David Pecker that another woman had
2   come forward with the claim of a sexual encounter that she
3   had had with the defendant while he was married.
4            That woman was an adult film actress, a porn star
5   named Stormy Daniels.
6            As Pecker had promised and as they had done for the
7   last year, Howard got in touch with Michael Cohen at the
8   Trump Organization immediately.
9            Howard told Cohen about the story.
10            He connected him with Stormy Daniels' lawyer,
11   Keith Davidson, the same lawyer who had represented Karen
12   McDougal.
13            And Cohen then discussed the situation with Trump,
14   who was adamant that he did not want the story to come out.
15   Another story about sexual infidelity, especially with a
16   porn star, on the heels of the Access Hollywood tape could
17   have been devastating to his campaign.
18            So at Trump's direction, Cohen negotiated a deal
19   to buy Ms. Daniels' story in order to prevent American
20   voters from learning that information before Election Day.
21             Under that deal, another non-disclosure agreement,
22   Daniels agreed that she would not disclose the sexual
23   encounter in exchange for a payment of $130,000.
24            But Trump directed Cohen to try to delay finalizing
25   the deal, to delay making any payment as long as possible;

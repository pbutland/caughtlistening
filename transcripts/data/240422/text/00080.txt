Opening Statement - Mr. Blanche
Page 897
1   who are wealthy, people who are famous enter into
2   non-disclosure agreements regularly, and there's nothing
3   illegal about it.
4            I expect that you will learn that when
5   Ms. Daniels threatened to go public with her false claim
6   of a sexual encounter with President Trump back in 2008
7   [sic], that it was, as the People just said, very close
8   to the election. And it was almost an attempt by
9   Ms. Clifford/Ms. Daniels to extort President Trump.
10            MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
11            THE COURT:  Sustained.
12            MR. BLANCHE:  It was sinister. And it was an
13   attempt to try to embarrass President Trump, to embarrass
14   his family.
15            Because, as the People alluded to, at that time
16   there were all kinds of salacious allegations going out,
17   going around about President Trump, and it was damaging to
18   him and damaging to his family.
19            And you heard and you will hear during this trial
20   that President Trump fought back, like he always does and
21   like he's entitled to do, to protect his family, his
22   reputation and his brand. And that is not a crime.
23            You heard the People talk about this term "hush
24   money payments", and I expect you'll hear that term used
25   during the trial.

1 is kind of a detailed analysis, and I am glad to hear about
2 it now, although it would have been better if we heard
3 about it a months ago when we provided those exhibits and
4 we could have hashed some of these things out in motions in
5 limine, which we have passed the motions in limine
6 deadline. That being said —— in order to get an advanced
7 ruling.
8 That being said, I understand what Mr. Bove is
9 saying, and I think there are certain portions of some of
10 the emails or texts that would come in but not for the
11 truth. I do think that is kind of a case—by—case analysis.
12 My suggestion is that Mr. Bove give us the proposed
13 portions of these emails and texts that he believes should
14 not be coming in for the truth. We can see if we agree
15 about some of them. For example, the one that Mr. Bove
16 just mentioned, which would be People's Exhibit 163, there
17 is a portion of that email chain in which there is a
18 detailed recitation of the Dino Sajudin story. Although
19 that should come in because it informs what happened
20 afterwards, we're not intending to argue that that is
21 coming in for the truth of the matter asserted. So that is
22 an example where I think we could agree, and there are
23 probably many others.
24 THE COURT: Mr. Bove, what I would ask you to do
25 is identify the email or the email threads that you are

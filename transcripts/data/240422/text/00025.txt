1                 Any notes a juror takes are only for that juror's
2       own personal use in refreshing his or her recollection.
3                 Thus, jurors who chose not to take notes must
4       rely on their own independent recollection and must not be
5       influenced by any notes another juror may have taken.
6                 Also, a juror's notes are not a substitute for
7       the recorded transcript of the testimony or for any exhibit
8       received into evidence.
9                 If during your deliberations there is a
10       discrepancy between a juror's recollection and his or her
11       notes regarding the evidence, you should ask to have the
12       relevant testimony read back or the exhibit produced for
13       your inspection.
14                 At the end of each day, you will leave your notes
15       on your chair.  They will be collected and safeguarded here
16       and at the end of trial they will be destroyed.
17                 As judge's of the fact, you alone determine the
18       truthfulness and accuracy of each witness.  You must decide
19       whether a witness tells the truth and was accurate or
20       instead testified falsely or was mistaken.
21                 You must also decide what importance to give to
22       the testimony you accept as truthful and accurate.  It is
23       the quality of the testimony that is controlling, not the
24       number of witnesses who testified.

1        Stormy Daniels was inadmissible.  We think that the logic
2        of the ruling should apply with equal force to any
3        testimony from Mr. Pecker regarding the polygraph to Mr.
4        Sajudin.
5                 MR. STEINGLASS:  We're not intending to elicit
6        that.
7                 THE COURT:  There you are.
8                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you.
9                 Next, we think it's likely that the government
10        will offer evidence of some newspaper articles during the
11        testimony of Mr. Pecker.  Some from the National Enquirer.
12        Also, at least one, maybe two, from the Wall Street
13        Journal.  When those are offered, we would ask that the
14        limiting instruction be provided, that they're not being
15        offered for the truth, and to explain to the jury the
16        admissibility purposes for which they're being used at
17        trial.
18                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I'm not sure that is the
19        appropriate time to give that instruction.  I would like
20        to think about that.
21                 But, obviously, they're not being admitted for
22        their truth, and so it may be appropriate at some point to
23        inform the jury of that.
24                 THE COURT:  If you could give me a sense of what
25        these articles would be.

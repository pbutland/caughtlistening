1            THE COURT:  Sustained.
2            MR. BLANCHE:  He walked -- he has walked into a
3   courtroom very near here, raised his right hand, and swore
4   to tell the truth. And now he will tell you, I expect,
5   that he was lying.
6            MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
7            THE COURT:  Sustained.
8            Please approach.
9            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
10   at sidebar:)
11            MR. COLANGELO:  There is no showing that
12   Mr. Cohen testified falsely in any of the proceedings
13   that Mr. Blanche is referring to.
14            MR. BLANCHE:  What I just said is that he
15   testified that he testified falsely. He will testify that
16   when he pled guilty in front of Judge Pauley, he lied.
17            MS. HOFFINGER:  That's not what he said.
18            MR. BLANCHE:  That's what he said. He did say
19   that.
20            THE COURT:  That's not what is standing.
21            I don't know what you're testifying about from
22   the podium.
23            We'll hear it from the witness stand.
24            MR. BLANCHE:  They can use it against me.
25            THE COURT:  That's in dispute.  I read it's in

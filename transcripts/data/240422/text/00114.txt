1        intended purpose is for so I could read it to the jurors.
2                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you, Judge.  We will do that.
3                 The last issue relates to some records that I
4        think will be offered through the testimony of Mr. Pecker
5        or through a subsequent custodian from AMI.  They fit into
6        two categories, as I understand it, a set of emails and a
7        set of text messages.
8                 Without prejudging the testimony, I would not be
9        shocked if Mr. Pecker can lay a business records foundation
10        for some or all of those materials.  Certainly if he can't,
11        I would be shocked if the custodian couldn't achieve that.
12                 Especially in light of Mr. Howard's absence at
13        this trial, there are some complicated and embedded hearsay
14        issues in the documents.  Mr. Pecker is participating in
15        some of the text message exchanges.  He is also
16        participating in some of the emails.  Those are not
17        complicated.
18                 The ones where he is not a participant, there is
19        embedded hearsay issues that will need to be addressed.
20        We don't want to necessarily slow down the witness's
21        testimony when those come in as business records in front
22        of the jury, but at some point, particularly with respect
23        to communications that Mr. Pecker is not a party to, we
24        would like to be heard on the other hearsay issues they
25        raise.

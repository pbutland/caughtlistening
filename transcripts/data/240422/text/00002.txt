Jury Trial - Preliminaries/Sandoval Ruling

1       break a little bit earlier or a lot earlier than I
2       anticipated.
3                 We were informed this morning by juror number
4       620, who is alternate number six, you may recall that she
5       had a toothache last week.  She was able to make an
6       emergency appointment today at three o'clock.  Perhaps
7       because of the holiday, I don't know why, that appointment
8       was moved up to 1:20.
9                 So, I told her that we can break at 12:30 and I
10       think that's just something we have to do to make sure we
11       don't lose an alternate.
12                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Can I just ask you a quick
13       question, Judge?
14                 Would it be okay, for logistical and bathroom
15       purposes, if after the opening we take a short break to get
16       our witnesses upstairs and to go the bathroom?
17                 THE COURT:  Sure, of course.
18                 The other issue is, we received a call on Friday
19       from juror number nine, who was juror number 423, and I did
20       not speak with the juror, but my understanding is that the
21       juror was concerned about the media attention and wasn't a
22       hundred percent sure that she wanted to be here.
23                 The juror is here today.  I think that we should
24       speak with the juror.  I see we have a courtroom full of
25       people.

1        the jury of that.
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Great.
3                 MS. NECHELES:  Thank you.
4                 THE COURT:  We do have one juror -- I believe we
5        have one juror who observes the holiday.  We can find out
6        from her if she needs to leave at 2.
7                 MR. STEINGLASS:  My understanding is, I think I

19                 MR. BOVE:  First of all, during the testimony this
20        morning, being mindful of the Court's practice and ruling
21        about not speaking objections, we objected to some
22        testimony from Mr. Pecker about the whereabouts of Dylan
23        Howard.
24                 I wanted to amplify that objection and move to

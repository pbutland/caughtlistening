Court’s Opening
Page 834
1 Court, say something to the effect of, let the record
2 reflect that the witness is indicating about a foot.
3 We do that because sometimes it becomes necessary
4 to have the court reporter read back what a witness has
5 said or what a witness is indicating. If somebody does not
6 say orally for the record that the witness is indicating
7 with his or her hands, when that portion of the record is
8 read back we may not remember what the witnesses indicated.
9 You, of course, will be able to see with your own
10 eyes and you can make your own judgment.
11 The trial formally begins with what the law calls
12 an opening statement by the prosecutor. The law requires
13 the prosecutor to make an opening statement.
14 The law, however, does not require the defendant
15 to make an opening statement.
16 If the defendant does not make an opening
17 statement, that is not a factor from which you may draw any
18 inference unfavorable to him. Remember, what the lawyers
19 say in an opening statement, or at any time thereafter, is
20 not evidence. The lawyers are not witnesses. What I say
21 is not evidence. I am not a witness.
22 You must decide this case on the evidence and
23 remember at all times that what the lawyers say at any time
24 is not evidence.
25 After the completion of the opening statements,

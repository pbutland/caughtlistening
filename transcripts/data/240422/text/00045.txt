12   information to Cohen, so Donald Trump would then prevent the
13   information from becoming public.
14            Second, they agreed that AMI would use its tabloids
15   and magazines to publish flattering stories about the
16   defendant.
17            And, third, they agreed that AMI would use those
18   same publications to attack Mr. Trump's political opponents.
19             After the meeting, David Pecker told the National
20   Enquirer's Editor-in-Chief, a man named Dylan Howard, to
21   report directly to Pecker about this Trump Organization
22   conspiracy and he enlisted his help in carrying it out.
23            And, together, those coconspirators then followed
24   through on every aspect of this scheme I just described.
25             So, for example, the National Enquirer ran headline

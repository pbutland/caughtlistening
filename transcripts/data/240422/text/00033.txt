2 Some of those unconscious views may come from
3 stereotypes and attitudes about people or about groups of
4 people that may impact on a person's thinking and
5 decision—making without that person even knowing it.
6 As a juror, you are asked to make a very important
7 decision about another member of the community.
8 I know you would not want to make that decision
9 based on such stereotypes or attitudes, that is, on implicit
10 biases.
11 And it would be wrong for you to do so.
12 A fair juror must guard against the impact of such
13 stereotypes or attitudes.
14 You can do this by asking yourself during your
15 deliberations whether your views and conclusions would be
16 different if the defendant, witnesses or others that you
17 have heard about or seen in court were of a different race,
18 color, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity
19 or expression, religious practice, age, political
20 affiliation or sexual orientation or if they did not have a
21 disability.
22 If the answer is yes, then in keeping with your
23 promise to be fair, reconsider your views and conclusions
24 along with the other jurors, and make sure your decision is
25 based on the evidence and not on stereotypes or attitudes.

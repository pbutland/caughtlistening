11       untrue, disparaging and personally identifying post about
12       the Court's Principal Law Clerk from the website, Donald J.
13       Trump dot com.  The Court fined the defendant $5,000.

15       document number 1598, the Court will allow the People to
16       elicit that on October 25, 2023, the defendant was found to
17       have intentionally violated a court order by making public
18       attacks on the Judge's law clerk, despite two prior court
19       orders not to do so.  The Court fined the defendant
20       $10,000.
21                 Moving on to the next proceeding, and that would
22       be Carroll v. Trump, 22, CV, 7311, and that would be ECF
23       number 214.  The Court will allow the People to elicit that
24       on September 6, 2023, the defendant was found to have
25       defamed E. Jean Carroll in public statements in 2019 by

Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 878
1            And about a month after the election, Pecker then
2   authorized AMI to release both Sajudin and McDougal from
3   their non-disclosure agreements.
4            So, having paid for the stories in order to keep
5   them from the public before Election Day, Pecker and AMI
6   then told both McDougal and Sajudin a month after the
7   election that they were no longer bound by the
8   non-disclosure agreements.
9            In January 2017, Pecker met again with Donald
10   Trump.  This was before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. He was
11   still working primarily from Trump Tower here in Manhattan,
12   and they met privately in Trump's office.  The defendant
13   thanked Pecker for handling the McDougal and Sajudin
14   stories, and he invited him to the inauguration.
15            And that summer, the defendant invited Pecker to
16   the White House.
17            Pecker brought his eyes and ears, Dylan Howard from
18   the National Enquirer, to that dinner.
19            And the defendant hosted a thank you dinner to
20   thank Pecker and AMI for their contributions to his
21   campaign.
22            There were a few other loose ends to deal with
23   after the election.
24            One was figuring out how Michael Cohen was going to
25   get paid back for the Stormy Daniels payoff.

1   J. Trump". You will hear that he told people that he
2   served as President Trump's personal attorney. You will
3   hear that he did legal work for President Trump and the
4   First Lady as his personal attorney.
5            Now, the People talk about the ledger. I
6   mentioned the ledger a few times.
7            Listen, the ledger is just a fancy way of
8   describing how folks at Trump Tower, employees that work
9   for President Trump kept track of the money that came in
10   and the money that went out. There's nothing fancy about a
11   ledger. It's something, I suppose, like a checkbook, where
12   you keep track of what you're spending money on.
13            And I expect that you will learn that the record,
14   the ledger that was used in this case that President Trump
15   is charged in part with, that the information that was
16   placed in that ledger was done by someone named Deb
17   Tarasoff. I expect she will testify.
18            You will hear that she's a woman who has worked
19   for President Trump for decades.
20            Nobody is going to say she did anything wrong. I
21   don't expect the People will say she is part of this
22   scheme.
23            What she will tell you is she had a conversation
24   with another boss, someone who she worked for, another
25   accountant, someone who has nothing to do with this; and

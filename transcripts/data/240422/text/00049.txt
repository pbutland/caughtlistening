Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 866
1            And they knew that public disclosure of Sajudin's
2   information would hurt that campaign.
3            Michael Cohen even coordinated with AMI throughout
4   the whole process and insisted that AMI amend the agreement
5   with Mr. Sajudin after it was signed, to add a $1 million
6   damages penalty fee if Sajudin violated the confidential
7   agreement.
8            So you have the candidate's fixer actively
9   colluding with a catch-and-kill deal with the media
10   enterprise by adding deal terms to lock up the negative
11   information even tighter to keep it from coming out before
12   the election.
13            And when AMI later determined that Mr. Sajudin's
14   allegations weren't even true, Cohen told Pecker not to
15   release Sajudin, not to release him from his NDA until after
16   the presidential election.
17            And because of the agreement they he had reached,
18   Pecker did what Cohen said.
19            Pecker deliberately delayed releasing Sajudin from
20   his non-disclosure agreement with AMI until after the
21   November 2016 election, when it could no longer hurt Trump's
22   candidacy.
23            So that was just the first of the three
24   catch-and-kill deals that I mentioned that came out of the
25   Trump Tower conspiracy.

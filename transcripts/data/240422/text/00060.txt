1            Cohen made that payment at Donald Trump's direction
2   and for his benefit, and he did it with a specific goal of

4            Now, look, no politician wants bad press, but the
5   evidence at trial will show that this was not spin or
6   communication strategy; this was a planned, coordinated
7   long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to
8   help Donald Trump get elected, through illegal expenditures,
9   to silence people who had something bad to say about his
10   behavior, using doctored corporate records and bank forms to
11   conceal those payments along the way.
12            It was election fraud.  Pure and simple.
13            We will never know, and it doesn't matter, if this
14   conspiracy was the difference-maker in a close election, but
15   you will see evidence in the defendant's own words from his
16   social media posts, from his speeches at campaign rallies
17   and other events, you will see in his own words, making
18   crystal clear that he was certainly concerned about how all
19   of this could hurt his standing with voters and with female
20   voters in particular.
21            You will also see evidence that on election night,
22   as news outlets got closer to calling the election for
23   Donald Trump, Keith Davidson, he was the lawyer for both
24   Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, texted Dylan Howard at
25   the National Enquirer and he said, "What have we done?"

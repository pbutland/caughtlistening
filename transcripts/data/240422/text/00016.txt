1                 Good morning jurors.  Welcome back.
2                 Members of the Jury, we are about to proceed with
3       the trial of the People of the State of New York versus
4       Donald J. Trump.
5                 At the outset, I am going to explain the various
6       stages of a trial and what you may expect to see and hear
7       during the trial so that you may better understand what is
8       taking place.  I will also remind you of some basic
9       principles of law which apply to this and all criminal
10       trials.
11                 At the conclusion of the case, I will again
12       remind you of those principles.  I will define the crimes
13       charged, explain the law that applies to those charged
14       crimes and list for you the elements that the People must
15       prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
16                 These introductory instructions will take about
17       30 minutes and may sound similar to what you heard last
18       week.
19                 As you can see, a court reporter is taking down
20       everything that is being said.  What the reporter takes
21       down is called the record of the trial.  Sometimes you will
22       see a witness use his or her hands to illustrate something.
23                 For example, a witness may say that an object was
24       this far away, indicating with their hands.
25                 Normally, we will then hear the lawyers, or the

Opening Statement - Mr. Colangelo
Page 865
1   doorman named Dino Sajudin was trying to sell information
2   about an alleged out-of-wedlock child that Trump had
3   fathered with one of his former housekeepers.
4            So, as they agreed at the Trump Tower meeting,
5   Pecker immediately contacted Cohen with that information.
6             Cohen then told the defendant, Donald Trump, who
7   told Cohen to take care of it.
8            After consulting with Cohen, Pecker directed
9   Howard, his Editor-in-Chief at the National Enquirer, to
10   negotiate an agreement to pay $30,000 to Sajudin to buy the
11   exclusive rights of that story.
12            And the evidence will show that Pecker was not
13   acting as a publisher; he was acting as a coconspirator.
14             The evidence will show that this was a highly
15   unusual deal.  Even for tabloid journalism, it was a lot
16   more money than they would usually pay to a source.
17            They bought Sajudin's story without even fully
18   investigating it.
19            And it was the first time that David Pecker had
20   ever paid anyone for information about Donald Trump.
21            But, Pecker directed that the deal take place
22   because of the agreement he had reached and because he had
23   promised Donald Trump at the Trump Tower meeting in August
24   of 2015 that he would use his media empire to help the
25   defendant's campaign.

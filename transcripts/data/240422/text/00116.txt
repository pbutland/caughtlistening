1        complicated, and we would ask to be heard at that time or
2        whatever time the Court thinks is appropriate.
3                 THE COURT:  Let's discuss it now.
4                 MR. BOVE:  I can go exhibit by exhibit.
5                 THE COURT:  You can show me a couple of exhibits,
6        I really just want to hear your legal argument.
7                 MR. BOVE:  So, for example, Government's Exhibit
8        163 is a string of November 2015 emails between people I
9        understand to be AMI employees, Sharon Churcher, Barry
10        Levine and Dylan Howard.  So, as I said, I expect one way
11        or the other the government to lay a business records
12        foundation that that email thread can come in, not for the
13        content of the statements but for the fact that AMI
14        maintained an email system that allows those to come in.
15        There are factual assertions in that email that are made by
16        hearsay declarants, none of whom are going to testify at
17        the trial, so those factual assertions in the email cannot
18        come in for the truth.
19                 When I say it is a little bit tedious, but there
20        are several emails like this, and many, many sets of text
21        messages like this.  I am not suggesting the government is
22        doing anything wrong here, but we would like to flag it
23        because it does raise some complex issues that are going to
24        need to be addressed.
25                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Let me just say briefly that this

Opening Statement - Mr. Blanche
Page 896
1   reason why these invoices were recorded the way they were
2   recorded way after the election -- President Trump was
3   already in office -- was to cover up for Mr. Cohen,
4   suggesting that Mr. Cohen was somehow trying to
5   influence -- "influence" is the word they used -- the 2016
6   election.
7            I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong
8   with trying to influence an election. It's called
9   democracy.
10            They put something sinister on this idea, as if
11   it was a crime. You'll learn it's not.
12            Michael Cohen paying Stormy Daniels or Stephanie
13   Clifford $130,000 in exchange for her agreeing to not
14   publicly spread false -- false claims about President
15   Trump is not illegal.
16            I'm going to say that again. Entering into a
17   non-disclosure agreement --
18            MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
19            THE COURT:  Sustained.
20            MR. BLANCHE:  Entering into a non-disclosure
21   agreement is perfectly legal.
22            MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
23            THE COURT:  Overruled.
24            MR. BLANCHE:  You will learn that companies do
25   that all the time with some regularity. Executives, people

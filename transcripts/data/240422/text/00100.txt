1   spending these expenditures to produce that, and then coming up
2   to producing a cover, I would have a meeting for the editors to
3   present their covers to me, and then I would take a look and see
4   if the cover that's being presented meets some qualifications.
5            As an example, we have a large research department, and
6   if the cover subject was going to be presented, I personally
7   wanted to make sure that the cover subject is not in the sole
8   interest of the editor, that it was interested in who our
9   audience is.
10            We would have a lot of conversations with respect to
11   why did they pick that subject, is the topic over right now,
12   what the cover line is going to be, what the photo is, and then
13   that's how.
14            So we would have these meetings before the publication
15   was finalized, and then we would have these meetings sometimes
16   once or twice a week.
17       Q.   And did you participate in editor meetings?
18       A.   Yes, I participated in all of them.
19       Q.   Were there editor meetings for all of AMI's
20   publications or on certain publications?
21       A.   Primarily the celebrity titles, the tabloids.
22       Q.   How about the National Enquirer?
23       A.   Yes, for the National Enquirer, yes.
24       Q.   Was that AMI's most well known tabloid, to use your
25   word?

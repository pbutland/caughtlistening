1       truthfulness and accuracy of another person's testimony or
2       statements.  You bring to this process all of your varied
3       life experiences.  In life you frequently decide the
4       truthfulness and accuracy of statements made to you by
5       other people.  The same factors used to make those
6       decisions should be used in this case when evaluating the
7       testimony.
8                 At the end of the trial I will give you some
9       examples of those factors.
10                 There are rules for all stages of a trial,
11       including rules that govern whether certain evidence may be
12       introduced and, if so, how and when.
13                 Part of my job is to enforce those rules.  Some
14       of these rules you may understand the nature of the rule
15       but some of them you may not understand unless you studied
16       the law.  The rules have been carefully developed over
17       hundreds of years for the sole purpose of guaranteeing a
18       fair and orderly trial.
19                 In other words, the rules are not designed to
20       determine whether the evidence you hear and see is true or
21       false, accurate or inaccurate.  It is for you, not for me,
22       to evaluate the evidence and make those decisions.
23                 The rules are designed to ensure that the
24       evidence you hear and see is relevant and in a form that
25       permits you to evaluate it fairly.

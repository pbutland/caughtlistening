1       stipulation.  A stipulation is information which both
2       parties agree to present to the jury as evidence without
3       calling a witness to testify to that information.
4                 Thus, evidence may come in the form of physical
5       items such as documents, photographs, clothing or charts.
6                 When a lawyer is questioning a witness and in the
7       question refers to a physical object for the first time,
8       the object is normally marked with a number or a letter of
9       the alphabet so that we can more easily identify the object
10       and refer to it.  That procedure is very helpful in keeping
11       track of physical objects.
12                 Sometimes, depending on the type of physical
13       object, it may be too difficult or inconvenient to mark the
14       object and the object is deemed marked rather than actually
15       marked.
16                 Normally, when the object is first referred to a
17       lawyer will ask the Court to have the object marked for
18       identification.
19                 If the People make the request and the Court
20       grants the request, the object is indeed marked with a
21       number.  If the defendant makes a request and the Court
22       grants the request, the object is deemed or marked with a
23       letter of the alphabet.  That just helps us to remember who
24       introduced the Exhibit.

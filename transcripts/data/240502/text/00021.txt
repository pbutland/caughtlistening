Jury Trial - Hearing
1824
1       whether President Trump has willfully violated the Gag
2       Order beyond a reasonable doubt, it makes sense, the Court
3       has to look at what all the press and all the media and
4       what Mr. Pecker was reading about his statements.
5                 And so, when you look at what President Trump
6       said about his statements, it does matter.  It matters to
7       the willfulness and it matters to whether the reason for
8       the Gag Order is --
9                 THE COURT:  If I may, I would like to ask you a
10       question, and this has to do with what you are talking
11       about.
12                 If we look at the first exhibit, I don't remember
13       the exhibit letter, so I will call it number one, when
14       those statements were made, it was your client who went
15       down to that open area and stood in front of the press and
16       started to speak.
17                 It wasn't the press that went to him.  He went to
18       the press.  He didn't need to go in that direction.  The
19       door that he uses is to the right.
20                 So you are telling me that, you know, the
21       scrutiny is outrageous.  Nobody forced your client to go
22       stand where he did that day.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, I agree with that, but two
24       responses.
25                 One, there is a much different reason with

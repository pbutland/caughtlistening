Jury Trial - Hearing
1827
1                 At this moment, based on what I saw and heard, I
2       am not terribly concerned.
3                 MR. BLANCHE:  I will stop with that.  I will talk
4       about Mr. Cohen and the Defendant.
5                 Judge, there are two statements the Government
6       read.  One was outside of the courtroom and one in response
7       to an interview.
8                 Again, the second one was on April 23rd.  And,
9       Judge, Mr. Cohen, and I am going to spend a few minutes on
10       this because it's extremely important, in my view the most
11       significant one, has been inviting and almost daring
12       President Trump to respond to everything he has been
13       saying.
14                 Again, personal attacks on his character, mocking
15       him for being on trial and also his candidacy for
16       Presidency of the United States.
17                 So I just want to put a few up on the screen.
18                 THE COURT:  Very quickly, please.  I want you to
19       make your argument.
20                 MR. BLANCHE:  Sure.
21                 So, Exhibit 39, this goes to Mr. Cohen mocking
22       President Trump on X.
23                 If we can go to page two and then six and seven,
24       just very quickly.  We can -- if we can blow it up a little
25       bit.

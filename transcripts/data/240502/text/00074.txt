1       Q    Okay.  Can you read for us the statement.
2       A    "To Whom it May Concern:"
3       Next paragraph.
4       "Over the past few weeks, I have been asked countless times
5   to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship that I
6   had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago."
7       Next paragraph.
8       "The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged
9   affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017 and now
10   again in 2018."
11       "I am not denying this affair because I was paid 'hush
12   money' as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids.  I am
13   denying this affair because it never happened."  Period.
14       Next paragraph.
15       "I will have no further comment on this matter."  Period.
16        "Please feel free to check me out on Instagram at
17   @TheStormyDaniels."
18       Excuse me, "@TheStormyDaniels."
19       Q    Mr. Davidson, how would you characterize truthfulness
20   of this statement?
21       A    I think it's technically true.
22       Q    Can you explain that?
23       Can you explain how it's true that it says an alleged sexual
24   relationship, which basically denies them having a sexual
25   relationship; is that right?

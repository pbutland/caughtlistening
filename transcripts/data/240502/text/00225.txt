1       Q    But, you do know that the recording cuts off.  And you
2   don't know what happened after that; right?
3       A    Just that it cut off.
4       Q    And you don't know what was going on before that?
5       A    That's correct.
6       Q    I want to now get back to the actual acquisition
7   process for these two devices.
8       These came to HTAU on January 23rd of 2023; right?
9       A    They did come to our Office, yes.
10       Q    And I'm being a little imprecise.  There are two
11   iPhones; right?
12       A    That's right.
13       Q    If I say CP1 and CP2, you will know what I mean?
14       A    I will.
15       Q    And at the time these phones came to HTAU, is it your
16   testimony that you were not provided with the copies that the
17   FBI had seized?
18       A    Yeah, I did not receive those.
19       Q    You did not have access to the data that the FBI seized
20   from these devices in 2018; did you?
21       A    I did not.
22       Q    And you did not ask for that data; did you?
23       A    I did not.
24       Q    And you didn't ask any questions about what the FBI had
25   done to the devices in 2018; correct?

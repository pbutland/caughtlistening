1   text?
2       A    That's correct.
3       Q    I want to talk a little bit about the time here.
4       In your work, have you become familiar with different time
5   zones and how timestamps work on different phones and other
6   devices?
7       A    Yes, I have.
8       Q    Are you familiar with UTC?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    What is UTC?
11       A    Universal Time Coordinated. Basically stands for the
12   old way of weighing time. GMT, Greenwich Mean Time.
13       We're on an Earth with 24 Time Zones, so one place starts
14   with zero. There are a few zones that go around. New York here,
15   we're either two different times, depending upon when it
16   changes twice a year. So, it would be UTC minus 4 or UTC minus
17   5.
18       Q    Meaning, if the time up there says 7:09:12 P.M. UTC
19   minus 4, what Time Zone is that time in?
20       A    So, it's already converted to Eastern Standard Time,
21   so it's 7:09 PM.
22       Q    And you mentioned the time change either being UTC
23   minus 4 or UTC minus 5.
24       Does that relate to Daylight Saving Time?
25       A    Yes, it does.

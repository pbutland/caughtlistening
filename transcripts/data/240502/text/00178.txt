D. Daus - Direct/Conroy
1981
1       A    I have a degree in psychology.
2       I've been in this field a number of -- 20 years. I have a
3   number of industry standard certifications, as well.
4       Q    Can you tell us about some of your certifications?
5       A    Certainly. One is a CCME, a Cellebrite Certified
6   Mobile Examiner. Another one would be a Certified Computer
7   Examiner.
8       Q    Where did you receive that training?
9       A    That training has been over the years that I've been
10   accompanied with this type of job. It comes from the company
11   itself, for Cellebrite. The other certification happens to be
12   an internal body of trainees and trainers.
13       Q    Can you tell us about your experience in the field and
14   your work history?
15       A    Certainly. So, before the ten years here, I worked two
16   years for Guidance Software. It was a company that created
17   EnCase. It's software that does forensics.
18       Two years prior to that, I was embedded in the military in
19   Iraq, doing the same type of work here.
20       Q    When were you in Iraq?
21       A    From April -- end of April '09 to when we closed, in
22   November of 2011.
23       Q    And what were you doing over there?
24       A    Same type of work as here.
25       Q    What's your current role in HTAU?

Proceedings
1942
1 MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, first of all, we've just
2 been handed this stack. If anything, we need to go through
3 them.
4 But it seems odd that they're asking the Court for
5 sort of an advanced ruling on these kinds of things.
6 I think the Gag Order is very specific.
7 So I guess my first request would be to have some
8 time to look at it.
9 We don't want to be in this position either. If
10 they're talking about witnesses in the case, people that
11 the defendant is not supposed to be talking about based
12 on the Gag Order —— I understand and fully respect that
13 there is a political campaign going on. There is also a
14 criminal case going on in this courtroom. That's what the
15 Order is seeking to protect. I think we need to really be
16 careful with this situation.
17 THE COURT: I appreciate what you are bringing to
18 my attention, Ms. Necheles.
19 I'm not going to give advanced rulings. I'm not
20 going to be in a position of looking at posts and
21 determining in advance whether you should or should not
22 post these on Truth Social as part of your official
23 campaign website.
24 There is no ambiguity in the Order. The Appellate
25 Division has already weighed in on that.

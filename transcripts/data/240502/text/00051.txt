1   tell, and keeping in mind that this is in London time, UTC time,
2   can you tell -- does this refresh your recollection about when
3   Election Day was in 2016?
4       A    November 9th.
5       Q    I'm just reminding you about the UTC time.
6       So I think you said you weren't a hundred percent familiar
7   with the relationship between UTC Time and East Coast Time; is
8   that true?
9       A    I don't have a particular knowledge of it.
10       Q    Okay.  And does, in UTC time, was that text sent at
11   approximately 3:00 in the morning?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    Okay.  And the first text in this exchange is from you;
14   is that correct?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And what did you say?
17       A    "What have we done?"
18       Q    What did you mean by that, Mr. Davidson?
19       A    This was -- this is sort of gallows humor.
20       It was on Election Night as the results were coming in, and
21   there was sort of a surprise amongst the broadcasters and
22   others that Donald Trump was leading in the polls and that there
23   was a growing sense that folks were about ready to call the
24   election.
25       Q    And you referred to it as "gallows humor."

Davidson - Cross/Bove
1936
1       A.   I think that's fair.
2       Q.   And it would make -- it would make you look better when
3   you went to Phoenix to be able to say, "I have already got the
4   National Enquirer interested in this," correct?
5       A.   I don't know about that.
6       Q.   It did not help you gain trust with the client to be
7   able to say that you had already generated interest in the
8   potential story; is that your testimony?
9       A.   No, that's not my testimony.
10       Q.   So it was helpful to you to be able to say to Karen
11   McDougal and Jay Grdina, in mid June of 2016, you had already
12   communicated with the National Enquirer, right?
13       A.   Maybe, or maybe not.  Perhaps.
14       Q.   And this is one of the ways your relationship with
15   Dylan Howard benefited your law practice, right?
16       A.   I don't see that the two are related.
17       Q.   You testified on Tuesday about a meeting that you had
18   with Ms. McDougal in Los Angeles.
19            Do you remember that?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   I think you showed some text messages.  We eventually
22   got to the point where you remembered that the meeting was on
23   June 20, 2016?
24       A.   I believe so.
25       Q.   Mr. Howard travelled to Los Angeles for the meeting,

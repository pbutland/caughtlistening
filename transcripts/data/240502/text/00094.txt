1   relationship without an Engagement Letter; right?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Now, focusing on Ms. Rodriguez for a minute.
4       Is it fair to say that you've had a reciprocal referral
5   relationship with Gina Rodriguez?
6       A    I think that's fair.
7       Q    She sends you some business?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    Some clients?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    And vice-versa; you send her some clients; right?
12       A    I think less so, but perhaps.
13       Q    Reciprocal, but a little bit one-sided?
14       A    I don't know.
15       Q    You're still fairly close with Ms. Rodriguez; right?
16       A    Somewhat.
17       Q    I mean, you actually tried to represent her in
18   connection with this investigation; right?
19       A    Well, I didn't try to.
20       She was contacted by the District Attorney's Office. They
21   wanted her to come in and give a statement. And I returned the
22   call on her behalf as my client.
23       Q    The reason I used the word "try" is that you were
24   instructed by the District Attorney's Office that they viewed
25   that as a conflict because of your status as a witness; right?

1987
1 you open it up, you may see the title of it, maybe the author,
2 but you don’t know who published it, who wrote it and when it
3 was done. You would simply open up the book cover, and that’s
4 the information that would be considered metadata.
5 Q How is that metadata on the phone created?
6 A It’s created by the year and/or the operating system
7 itself and applications.
8 Q And does that depend on what kind of metadata it is?
9 A It just depends on the artifact.
10 Q As part of your work in HTAU, were you assigned to an
11 investigation involving Donald Trump?
12 A I was.
13 Q Were you assigned to two devices to analyze as part of
14 that investigation?
15 A Yes, I was.
16 Q What kinds of devices?
17 A There are two iPhones. The first one is an iPhone 6s,
18 and the second one is an iPhone 7.
19 Q Did you understand the authority that HTAU had to be
20 in possession and look at those two phones?
21 A As mentioned before, it was a Consent.
22 Q And whose Consent, if you know?
23 A The Consent was Michael Cohen.
24 Q And do you know whose phones those were?
25 A They were Michael Cohen’s.

Jury Trial - Hearing
1815
1       part in these proceedings without concern.
2                 And as I will get to in a few minutes, your
3       Honor, that concept alone is reason enough to deny the four
4       that we are here about this morning.
5                 And I know that the Court has stated repeatedly
6       that the Gag Order, and your Honor's intention is not to
7       allow unfettered attacks on President Trump, recognizing he
8       is running for President.  Doing a campaign every day, part
9       of the campaign takes place outside of this courtroom, part
10       of the campaign takes place in interviews, meetings with
11       potential voters, whether there is press present and on the
12       campaign trail, and your Honor said it again in the Order
13       on Tuesday.
14                 And there is no dispute, I think, among anybody,
15       the Court, or the Government, that political attacks and
16       responses to political attacks does not violate the Gag
17       Order.
18                 And I disagree with the People.  I disagree that
19       the time that we start looking at what President Trump is
20       responding directly to is the day of the Gag Order.
21                 Since President Trump announced his candidacy to
22       run for election this November in '22, almost two years
23       ago, there have been multiple and repeated attacks on him
24       from, among other people, Michael Cohen, and folks that
25       Michael Cohen has on his podcast regularly.

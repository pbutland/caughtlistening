1   were made.
2       Q    And you said it was from an app called "WhatsApp?"
3       A    That's correct.
4       Q    What is WhatsApp?
5       A    WhatsApp is an app, an encrypted app that users use to
6   communicate with each other.
7       Q    And you said -- what is an encrypted app?
8       A    It just means that the conversation between you and the
9   next party is encrypted.
10       It can't be intercepted and/or vetted.
11       Q    WhatsApp is an example of that type of an app?
12       A    It's an example.
13       Q    Did you find other encrypted apps on either CP1 and/or
14   CP2?
15       A    I did.
16       Q    Which ones did you find, if you remember?
17       A    Telegram and Signal.
18       Q    Now, if you recall, was People's 265, which is in
19   evidence and was already in evidence, an audio recording that
20   you extracted from CP2?
21       A    Yes, it was.
22                MR. CONROY:  Could we pull up what's in evidence as
23       People's 266.
24                And if you could blow that up a little bit.

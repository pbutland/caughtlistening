K. Davidson - Direct/Steinglass
1848
1   that neither party could maintain a copy of this Side Letter
2   Agreement, and that only Michael Cohen and I could possess a
3   fully executed copy of it.
4       Q    And to be clear, is this the document that decodes, I
5   guess, the Nondisclosure Agreement between Stormy Daniels and
6   Donald Trump?
7       A    The Settlement Agreement and Nondisclosure Agreement,
8   yes, this is the Side Letter Agreement that decodes the
9   underlying Settlement Agreement.
10       Q    And I should clarify.  When I say "decode," I mean
11   provides the real names of the parties to the Settlement
12   Agreement?
13       A    True.
14       Q    Okay.  Turning to the bottom -- the next page.  Oh, no,
15   just the bottom of this page.  And I will just ask you, who --
16   if you signed the Agreement?
17       A    I did sign the Agreement.
18       Q    Silly question, but where?
19       A    Above my name.
20       Q    On the line above your name?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Who signed on behalf of Peggy Peterson a/k/a Stephanie
23   Gregory Clifford a/k/a Stormy Daniels?
24       A    She signed that herself.
25       Q    And what was the date that she signed it?

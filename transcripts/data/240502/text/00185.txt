1       Q    Did one of the phones that you received have a gold
2   case?
3       A    It did.
4       Q    Was that the 6s?
5       A    That was.
6       Q    Did you assign an identifier to that phone to use
7   within HTAU?
8       A    I did.
9       Q    What was the identifier?
10       A    CP-0001.
11       "CP" stands for cell phone.
12       Q    Is that sort of a standard practice in a particular
13   case, you would name any phone CP-001 through any phones?
14       A    That's correct.
15       Q    Is that okay if I call that "CP1" going forward?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    Do you recall the last four digits of the phone number
18   for that phone?
19       A    0114.
20       Q    Did you note the serial number of that phone?
21       A    I did.
22       I don't recall it.
23       Q    Is there something that could refresh your
24   recollection?
25       A    Notes would, yes.

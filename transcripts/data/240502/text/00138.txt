Proceedings

2 Thank you.
3 Your Honor, I just handed up a stack of newspaper
4 articles by legal commentators and others.
5 People like, the first one is entitled "Trump's
6 New York Prosecution is a Bogus Case by Bogus Prosecutors."
7 And these articles are by a number of legal
8 commentators, including Jonathan Turley and Andrew
9 McCarthy.
10 These articles are all articles which President
11 Trump would like to post on his Truth, but they all discuss
12 this case. They discuss witnesses who have testified.
13 They discuss what the aspects of the case are.
14 They're very critical of this case. They're
15 important for his election campaign. They're talking about
16 the kinds of issues that he has been raising.
17 But he has some concerns because they do mention
18 witnesses. They mention the prosecutors in this case by
19 name.
20 We think they are perfectly fine, but we think
21 there is some ambiguity in the Gag Order.
22 So we're asking for your Honor to take a look at
23 them so that he knows he is not violating the Gag Order
24 when he posts this.
25 THE COURT: People?

Jury Trial - Hearing
1825
1       respect to Mr. Cohen, which I will get to in a minute.
2                 And two, nobody is forcing him, but he is running
3       for President.  He has to be able to speak.
4                 So, your Honor is right.  He can walk out there
5       and go right or he can walk out there and go left and make
6       a statement which he is entitled to do and has to do, your
7       Honor.
8                 So we are not --
9                 THE COURT:  That's why he is being allowed to do
10       that.
11                 That's why that entire area has been setup the
12       way that it is setup, to ensure that your client, as a
13       candidate for presidency, has the opportunity to speak
14       about absolutely anything he wants, including the District
15       Attorney of New York County.  But there are just some
16       things he cannot talk about.
17                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, I am going to talk
18       about Mr. Cohen in a minute.
19                 I want to address, briefly, the second Pecker
20       statement, which is Exhibit H to the People's Affirmation.
21                 And this statement is -- President Trump is asked
22       the question, what have you thought of David Pecker's
23       testimony so far?
24                 When was the last time you spoke to him?
25                 President Trump said, he has been very nice.  I

Jury Trial - Hearing
1828
1                 For the record, it has a photo of President Trump
2       in an orange jumpsuit with a picture next to Nelson
3       Mandela, and it's just a long repost by Mr. Cohen
4       criticizing President Trump.
5                 And then we can turn to page six and page seven.
6       And, again --
7                 THE COURT:  What was the date on that?
8                 MR. BLANCHE:  That date, your Honor, should be up
9       at the top.
10                 April 8th of this year, your Honor.
11                 And then pages six and seven, it's more of the
12       same.  If we can focus on the date, please, at the top,
13       April 14th.
14                 And, again, keep messing with me Donald, and I
15       won't send any money to your commissary, a comment by
16       Mr. Cohen.  And then something obnoxious.
17                 And then on page seven, at the top with the date
18       first, please.
19                 And this is on April 16th, please don't forget
20       about the witnesses.  We also matter.  Reposting a photo of
21       President Trump.
22                 Next, if we can turn to Exhibit 64, quickly,
23       please.  And this one, Mr. Cohen -- this one says, oh my,
24       shits in pants.  Keep whining and crying and violating the
25       Gag Order, you petulant Defendant.

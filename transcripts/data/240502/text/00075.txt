1 A Yes.
2 Q And how is that —— how is that technically true?
3 A Because I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that
4 there was a relationship between Stormy Daniels and Donald
5 Trump.
6 I believe their relationship is an ongoing interaction.
7 Q And it also makes a reference —— withdrawn.
8 It denies that Stormy Daniels was paid hush money.
9 If I asked you to explain that, would you give basically the
10 same answer that you gave in connection with the denial from
11 January 10th of 2018?
12 A I would.
13 Q Okay. I want to go back to your exchange with Michael
14 Cohen on People's Exhibit 255.
15 Directing your attention, in particular, to Page 9, starting
16 with Entries 88 to 97.
17 (Displayed.)
18 Q Starting with the top. Can you give us the time,
19 please, and the date.
20 A The date is —— they are all January 3lst, 2018. It
21 starts at 12:21 a.m., from Michael Cohen to me.
22 Q And is that 12:21 a.m. UTC minus 5?
23 A I don't know.
24 Q Does it say UTC minus 5?
25 A It does.

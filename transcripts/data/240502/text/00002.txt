Jury Trial — Hearing
1805
1 the violations, and explain to me why you believe that it
2 constitutes a violation.
3 MR. CONROY: Sure, Judge.
4 Unless your Honor prefers it, I think that I will
5 not play each of the video clips or even read the direct
6 language. I will just talk about each of them, and I will
7 let you know which one I am speaking about as I am speaking
8 about it.
9 THE COURT: I agree you shouldn't play the video.
10 You can give me the exact language and why you think it is
11 a violation, you should do that.
12 MR. CONROY: Okay.
13 Judge, I just want to start by saying the
14 Defendant’s complaining that this Order restricting his
15 extrajudicial statements in this case, was not intended to
16 allow everyone to attack him, but not to allow him to
17 respond, and that's on page one of his memo.
18 The Order was issued because of the Defendant’s
19 persistent and escalating rhetoric aimed at participants in
20 this proceeding. And the Order was intended to prevent the
21 Defendant from attacking witnesses in this case and jurors
22 in the case and others.
23 He has already been found by the Court to have
24 violated the Order nine times, and he has done it again
25 here.

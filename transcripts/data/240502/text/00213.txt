5       Q    But there's also a Faraday bag?
6       A    There is.

9       A    Yes.
10       Q    You can do it immediately?
11       A    You can do it immediately.

17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And you know what that means?
19       A    Yep.
20       Q    Chain of custody is the process by which who handles
21   the device is tracked; right?
22       A    That's correct.
23       Q    Who acquired it; right?
24       A    Yes.

1   wanted a comment on -- on any interactions regarding Stormy
2   Daniels and Donald Trump.
3       Q    And so, just to clarify, you received an inquiry from
4   the Wall Street Journal that led you to believe that they were
5   getting ready to publish an article about the contact between
6   Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    And this was how you responded?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And tell us how you responded, please.  Just read it
11   for us.
12       A    "Nothing about the present day regurgitation of these
13   rumors causes us to rethink our prior denial issued in 2011."
14       Q    And did you write that to the Wall Street Journal
15   reporter?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    On what day?
18       A    January 10th, 2018.
19       Q    And what did you mean when you said "Our prior denial
20   issued in 2011"?
21       What was that a reference to?
22       A    The Cease and Desist demand letter that was sent to
23   TheDirty.com in 2011.
24       Q    And did you forward your response to the Wall Street
25   Journal reporter to anyone?

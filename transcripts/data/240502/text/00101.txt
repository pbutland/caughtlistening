K. Davidson - Cross/Bove
1904
1                 THE COURT:  Let me hear the objection.
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Well, since I don't know what
3        he's going to ask, it's a little hard for me to object.
4                 But, I don't think he could possibly be getting
5        into what Mark Pomerantz said to him, especially because
6        it sounded like he was getting into Mark Pomerantz's
7        impression of something the witness was saying, which is
8        something -- prosecutor's perceptions of witnesses'
9        perceptions -- is something you precluded in other
10        contexts.
11                 So, I didn't want the question to be asked on the
12        record.
13                 THE COURT:  What were you going to ask?
14                 MR. BOVE:  I was going to ask -- I'm summarizing
15        whether he recalled Mr. Pomerantz saying he was choosing
16        his words carefully because there was extortion inferred.
17                 The reason I'm asking that question is because of
18        the effect on the witness' state of mind in connection
19        with his subsequent interactions with the Government,
20        because the way that that meeting ended was he was
21        instructed to get an attorney.
22                 There was then a conversation that I would
23        like to probe, where he -- and I don't have to use
24        Mr. Pomerantz's name if that's offensive.  I am happy to
25        take that out.

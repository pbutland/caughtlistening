Jury Trial - Hearing
1823
1       if ten outlets are talking about Mr. Pecker.
2                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, the reason for the Order --
3       the reason for the Order is to make sure that witnesses
4       that are going to come in here and testify, are going to do
5       so honestly and without fear of reprisal.
6                 And my point in reflecting on the intense
7       scrutiny of every word said by every witness, is that
8       everybody can say whatever they want, except for President
9       Trump.
10                 THE COURT:  They are not -- they are not
11       defendants in this case.  They are not subject to the Gag
12       Order.
13                 That's a very significant issue that you are

15                 I don't have authority over most of the people
16       that are saying things.
17                 I couldn't possibly extend a Gag Order to them.
18       I just don't have that authority.  So, I don't see the
19       comparison.
20                 I don't see the analogy between comparing your
21       client, who is the Defendant, and who is subject to the Gag
22       Order, with ten members of the press who wrote an article.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am not asking your Honor for an
24       analogy.  I am not comparing one to the other.
25                 I am saying that when your Honor is considering

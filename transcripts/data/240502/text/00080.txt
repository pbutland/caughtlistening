K. Davidson - Direct/Steinglass
1883
1   would -- would -- you know, file an arbitration or sue Stormy,
2   and that would be a whole 'nother disaster.  So, we're trying
3   to placate him while also trying to meet Stormy's desires.
4       Q    And without getting into any privileged communications
5   between yourself and Stormy Daniels, did Michael Cohen threaten
6   a lawsuit against Stormy Daniels?
7       A    Many times.
8       Q    Can you tell us, basically, what he said about that?
9       A    He would -- I mean, he can be a very aggressive guy.
10   Aggressive in his pursuits to protect his client.
11       And he would, often times, you know, make legal threats,
12   say that he would bankrupt her and, um, "Rain legal hell down
13   upon her," um, and, "Don't fuck with us. You don't know who
14   you're fucking with," things like that.
15       Q    And what did you -- if you had an understanding, what
16   did you understand Michael Cohen to be attempting to get you to
17   do?
18       A    I don't understand your question.
19       Q    Okay.
20       Regarding Stormy Daniels' story, did you have an
21   understanding about what Michael Cohen wanted you to do
22   regarding Stormy Daniels and her story?
23       A    Well, he wants to hear her deny her story to protect
24   his client.
25       Q    That's what I was asking.

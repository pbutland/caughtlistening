1       A    Yes.
2       Q    Okay.
3       So, let's start with F17-CT.
4       Mr. Bove asked you if you said to Michael Cohen: "And now
5   that Avenatti has really driven a wedge, a serious wedge in
6   between Stormy and Gina, Avenatti is leaning on Gina and
7   saying, you know, basically we're lying, we know we're full of
8   shit in the media, we know that she was never threatened in Las
9   Vegas, we know all these things."
10       What did you mean when you said that?
11       A    I meant that, uh, that Avenatti was trying to, uh,
12   persuade Gina's testimony.
13       Q    So, were you in any way acknowledging that you were
14   lying?
15       A    No.
16       Q    Were you in any way acknowledging that Stormy Daniels
17   was never threatened in Las Vegas?
18       A    No.
19       Q    Is it your belief that -- or is it your meaning that
20   when you said that, you were talking about the things that
21   Avenatti was going to allege or was alleging?
22       A    That's correct.
23       Q    Similarly, Mr. Bove showed you, or read you, or played
24   for you, or all of the above, a portion of the same call and
25   gave you the transcript F17-ET.

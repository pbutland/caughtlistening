1                 MR. CONROY: Just for the parties and the Court
2        and the witness, could we display those notes?
3                 THE COURT:  Is there an identification of it?
4        Mark it for identification.
5                 MR. CONROY:  We could mark that as People's --
6        just one moment, Judge.
7                 (Whereupon, the People confer.)
8                 MR. CONROY:  If we could mark that as People's

13       Q    Mr. Daus, take a look at that.
14       Does that refresh your memory what the serial number for
15   the phone is?
16       A    Yes, it does.
17       Q    Tell us what it was.
18       A    Delta, November, Papa, Quebec, Charlie, Zero, Hotel,
19   One, Golf, Ralph, Yellow, and Three.
20       Q    And, if I may, to put that into the regular alphabet,
21   is that DNPQC0H1GRY3?
22       A    That is correct.
23       Q    Did the other phone that you received have a black
24   case?
25       A    It did.

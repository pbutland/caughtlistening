Jury Trial - Hearing
1816
1                 Again, to talk -- I will get more into this in a
2       minute from our exhibits, your Honor, to talk not only
3       about these proceedings, and not only about Mr. Cohen's
4       credibility, and not only attacking President Trump's
5       credibility, but also attacking him running for President,
6       the qualities he would bring as a leader of this nation and
7       reflecting on the presidency four years ago.
8                 THE COURT:  If I can make a suggestion, Mr.
9       Blanche.
10                 My main concern is the conduct that took place
11       after the Gag Order was implemented.
12                 I looked at the exhibits that you provided.  If
13       you want to go through some of them, that's fine, but it's

15                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am not going through all of them,
16       Judge, of course not.
17                 THE COURT:  Just, as you know, it's not going to
18       weigh very heavily on my decision if you refer to exhibits
19       a year ago or two years ago before the Gag Order was in
20       place.
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, it is not my intention
22       to do that.  We will get to that in a minute.
23                 In response to the Court's Order on Tuesday, and
24       in preparation for our hearing today, we are prepared to
25       pass up some additional exhibits.  And the only exhibits I

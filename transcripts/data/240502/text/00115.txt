K. Davidson - Cross/Bove
1918
1       A    I'm not going to discuss that.
2                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, I ask that the witness be
3        instructed to answer the question.
4                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
5                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
6        at sidebar:)
7                 THE COURT:  So, this is a sensitive area here.
8                 I think we need to establish, first, that he's
9        definitely not asserting any kind of privilege.
10                 MR. BOVE:  Okay.
11                 THE COURT:  Once he says he's not asserting
12        privilege, you can ask him the question again.
13                 If he refuses to answer, you can ask me for help.
14                 MR. BOVE:  Yes.
15                 Thank you.
16                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
17        in open court:)
18       Q    So, I want to focus on your representation of Capri
19   Anderson; okay?
20       A    Fair.
21       Q    My question is, was there a settlement between
22   Ms. Anderson and Mr. Sheen in connection with that
23   representation?
24       A    I'm not going to answer that.
25       Q    When you say "that", you're not invoking a privilege;

D. Daus - Cross/Bove
2010
1       Q    But there are some differences; right?
2       A    Yeah.
3       Q    And, to me, one of the differences breaks down to the
4   difference between Intel collection and the presentation of
5   evidence in criminal cases; correct?
6       A    Sure.
7       Q    Do you know what I mean by "Intel collection?"
8       A    A collection of things that are important for national
9   security.
10       Q    Right.
11       And in Iraq you were doing that, essentially, on a
12   battlefield, more or less; right?
13       A    In a lab, yes.
14       Q    And it was important to get information to parties who
15   could use it as quickly as possible; right?
16       A    Absolutely.
17       Q    That is, in that setting, in the Intel setting, that's
18   probably the top priority?
19       A    I would say.
20       Q    And it's not necessarily a top priority in connection
21   with a criminal investigation; right?
22       A    I do the same thing on every case.
23       Q    Well, the integrity of the data matters more in a
24   criminal case than on a battlefield; doesn't it?
25       A    I would say so, sure.

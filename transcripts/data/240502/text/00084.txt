1   said, Fuck it. I'll just do it myself." That's what I was
2   referring to in the statement.
3       Q    So, the statement does not undermine your belief that
4   the ultimate source of the funds was Mike -- was Donald Trump?
5       A    At the time of the transaction.
6       Q    Can you just clarify that for a second?
7       A    At the time of the transaction, Michael Cohen told
8   me -- as the statement said, at the time of the transaction,
9   Michael Cohen told me, "Fuck it. I'll just do it myself."
10       Q    Okay. So -- all right. I understand.
11       Thank you.
12       Um, my next question is, did you -- directing your
13   attention, I guess, to early April of 2018, did you go on CNN
14   and say that Michael Cohen used his own funds to pay Stormy
15   Daniels?
16       A    I believe so.
17       Q    And why did you say that?
18       A    Because I understood that he did.
19       Q    Based on the same statement that he made at the time
20   of the transaction?
21       A    And even later on, that December 9th conversation that
22   I had with him at the department store where he said that he
23   had not been reimbursed.
24       Q    Okay.
25                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Um, one more moment, please.

K. Davidson - Direct/Steinglass
1866
1       A    That was my understanding.
2       Q    Okay.  So I want to direct your attention to the first
3   line of the second paragraph:  "Rumors that I received hush
4   money from Donald Trump are completely false," okay.
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    How is that technically true?
7       A    Well, it's really no different than our interaction a
8   few minutes ago where you called it a payoff.
9       Q    Okay.
10       A    It wasn't a payoff and it wasn't hush money.  It was
11   consideration in a civil Settlement Agreement.
12       Q    Can you just explain that a little bit more of what
13   consideration is for, what you mean when you say a
14   consideration?
15       A    Well, I think, in the simplest of examples, a
16   consideration is money or something of value that's exchanged in
17   a contract.
18       I will pay you $5 if you mow my lawn.  The $5 will be a
19   consideration.
20       Q    So do I understand you correctly to be saying that you
21   don't think the term "hush money" accurately describes the
22   exchange of money that -- the money that was paid to Stormy
23   Daniels by Donald Trump?
24       A    Can you please restate that.
25       Q    Yeah.  Do I understand you -- withdrawn.

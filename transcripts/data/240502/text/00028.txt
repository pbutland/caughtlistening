Jury Trial — Hearing
1831
1 folks in this room, with reporters, who just blast
2 President Trump from what he did as President, and what he
3 would do if he is elected in November.
4 Multiple. I am not talking about one or two. I
5 am talking multiple, in excess of ten, way in excess of
6 ten.
7 Finally, as has been reported, because it’s true,
8 Mr. Cohen has started going on TikTok nightly and literally
9 making money.
10 So, there is, apparently, a way you can make
11 money with people doing things, while they are watching you
12 on TikTok. He actively encourages folks to give him money.
13 You can see that he has made money.
14 His TikTok repeatedly criticizes President Trump.
15 He said, as recently as April 29th, mocking and
16 almost poking President Trump as it relates to the Gag
17 Order, I am not the Defendant in a criminal matter, and I
18 am not the subject of Judge Merchan’s Gag Order. Donald
19 is, right.
20 And that is after criticizing him extensively.
21 This is not a man that needs protection from the
22 Gag Order. And when you look at what President Trump said
23 about Michael Cohen out here, and then in response to the
24 questions from the interviewer. He wasn’t talking about
25 his testimony at this trial.

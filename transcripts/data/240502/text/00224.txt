14 Q And you were instructed, were you not, to check the
15 phone itself, the physical device, to see if there was incoming
16 or outgoing calls on it around the time of that recording?
17 A Look at —— I wasn't instructed, per se, to look at the
18 calls coming in at that time.
19 Q You —— at one point you prepared a report, did you not,
20 of all incoming and outgoing calls on CPl, the device from which
21 that recording was extracted?
22 A Yes, those reports were pulled after.
23 Q And you found a call around the time of the recording
24 on the physical device; correct?
25 A I wasn't specifically asked to look at that.

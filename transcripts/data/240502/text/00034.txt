4   earlier.

6   are three bullet points -- executed agreement hand-signed by

14            Thank you both, Dylan.
15       Q    And who is this email sent to by Dylan?
16       A    It's sent to Michael Cohen and I.
17       Q    What is your understanding of what this email was
18   about?
19       A    This email followed a conversation, a conference call,
20   between Dylan and I with Michael Cohen.  That conversation took
21   place because there was difficulty in communications with
22   Michael Cohen, and I -- and I had lost trust in what he was
23   telling me.
24            And Dylan came in as the mediator and sort of mediated
25   that meeting, and he followed up with this email.

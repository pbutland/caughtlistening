D. Daus - Cross/Bove
2025
1   time you look at it.
2       Q    That is an automatic process; right?
3       A    It's automatic.
4       Q    Just the checkmark, yes, the hashes match; correct?
5       A    That's correct.
6       Q    And that's because these hashes, if you are really
7   being secure about it, they are very, very long sets of numbers
8   and letters; right?
9       A    Yes, they are.
10       Q    You don't want to spend a lot of time checking those
11   numbers and letters one by one; right?
12       A    You do not.
13       Q    The computer does it for you.  But it's as if, say,
14   fingerprints that match.  If the hash is the same, these are the
15   same two types of -- this is the same file; right?
16       A    That's correct.
17       Q    And so you testified today about some of the artifacts
18   that you extracted from two phones that were acquired from
19   Michael Cohen; right?
20       A    Yes, I did.
21       Q    And these artifacts are segments of a much broader set
22   of data that was pulled off of each phone; correct?
23       A    They are just segments.
24       Q    That's because you are able to, once the data is
25   parsed, you can use the program to select what the pieces of it

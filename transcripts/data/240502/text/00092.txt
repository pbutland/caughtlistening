K. Davidson - Cross/Bove

1       I think you said on Tuesday that you reached out to him
2   afterwards as a professional courtesy?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    But he wasn't involved in any negotiations; correct?
5       A    Not that I'm aware of.
6       Q    Let's focus on Cohen a little bit.
7       I think you said you encountered him for the first time in
8   2011?
9       A    True.
10       Q    And that was in connection with this kind of blog post
11   on The Dirty?
12       A    True.
13       Q    The Dirty was a web post at the time that focused on
14   gossip?
15       A    Fair.
16       Q    And there was a post with the general substance of the
17   same allegations that Stormy Daniels made subsequently, in
18   2016; right?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And at that time, 2011, Gina Rodriguez was Stormy
21   Daniels' manager?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    She told you that she wanted to get the story taken
24   down?
25       A    That's true.

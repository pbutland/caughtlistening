1       Q.   Go back to the headphones.
2       A.   It's fine.
3       Q.   I appreciate it.
4                 MR. BOVE:  Let me state it for the record.  We're
5        now going to play Defense F17A, with the corresponding
6        transcript which is dash 18.
7                 (Whereupon, audio recording was played for the
8        witness and Court only.)
9       A.   I think the wrong transcript is up.
10                 (Displayed.)
11       Q.   Please stop that there.
12            Does that refresh your recollection that you said to
13   Mr. Cohen:  "Was there ever any indication that Michael Cohen
14   needed authority from Donald Trump before he made that payment?
15   And I said, No, it was never discussed."
16            You said that, right?
17       A.   That's true.
18       Q.   You also in that conversation with Michael Cohen said,
19   "And why would an attorney have ever asked opposing counsel what
20   kind of conversations they had with their client."
21            You said that, right?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And you believed that, right?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   And the same way you invoked the privilege here,

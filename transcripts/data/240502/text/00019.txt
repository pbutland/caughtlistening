Jury Trial — Hearing
1822
1 happening in this courtroom and everything that the
2 witnesses are saying.
3 And, so, every time we whisper to our client,
4 it's live—streamed over all sorts of social media outlets,
5 every word the witnesses say, and so then you have
6 President Trump who is asked a question.
7 Everybody is talking about it. What do you think
8 of his testimony, and he doesn't say, I think he is a liar.
9 He better watch out.
10 He says something. He can’t just say, no
11 comment, repeatedly when he is running for President, and I
12 appreciate the Court’s concern, very much so.
13 And we are reacting to what your Honor wrote on
14 Tuesday, but it’s also appropriate to turn to what’s
15 happening with this trial.
16 THE COURT: What's happening in this trial is no
17 surprise to anyone. I mean, the former President of the
18 United States is on trial.
19 He is the leading candidate for the Republican
20 Party right now. It’s not surprising that we have press
21 here. We have press in the overflow room. There are
22 people throughout New York that are interested.
23 Everybody that came into this knew this would
24 happen. We all suspected it. There are no surprises here.
25 So, I don’t see how it would press on Mr. Trump

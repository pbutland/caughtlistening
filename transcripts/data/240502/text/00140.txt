Proceedings
1943
1                 We'll see where it goes from there.
2                 At this point, this Court and the higher court
3        have found there is nothing wrong with the Gag Order.
4                 I think the best advice you can give your client
5        is to do without, steer clear.
6                 MS. NECHELES:  Your Honor, I hear what you are
7        saying.  I heard what the Appellate Court has ruled.  I
8        think they're ruling in the abstract.  I believe there is
9        ambiguity.
10                 THE COURT:  I am not going to argue with you.
11        If you have an issue, take it up to the Appellate Division.
12        Take it up to the Court of Appeals.  I am not revisiting my
13        Order.  I am not going to.
14                 MS. NECHELES:  What we're seeking a clarification
15        on, when the witnesses have testified, or when there is an
16        analysis of the case and it mentions witnesses, or it
17        mentions that the prosecutors made certain arguments in
18        this Court, or the prosecutors were appointed by a certain
19        Justice, these are people who are analyzing the case and
20        talking about it being a political hit.  That is what
21        President Trump wants to be arguing at its core.
22                 And I, frankly, don't know whether that violates
23        the Gag Order.
24                 THE COURT:  I am not going to give you an advanced
25        ruling on this.

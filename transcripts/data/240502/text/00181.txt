1 Q Once the intake has been done, what happens to the
2 device?
3 A Once the intake is done, it is assigned an analyst. In
4 this case, it would have been me. We then look at the Search
5 Warrant or Consent Form, make sure all the numbers are correct,
6 and then proceed with the extraction of devices.
7 Q Would it be fair to say that the person who does the
8 intake is not always the person that does the analysis of a
9 particular device?
10 A Not always, that’s correct.
11 Q Have you, yourself, extracted data from and performed
12 analysis on smartphones, including Apple iPhones?
13 A Yes, I have.
14 Q Can you tell us a little bit more about the extraction
15 process, specifically for a cell phone?
16 A Depending upon whether it's an Android or an Apple
17 iPhone, we then take it into a particular room. If we have a
18 PIN code to it, then we’ll proceed with the extraction of the
19 device.
20 Q When you say, "If we have a PIN code," what do you
21 mean?
22 A In Consents, we are usually provided the PIN code.
23 Q You mean the password?
24 A That is correct.
25 Q What types of tools or programs do you use to extract

Jury Trial - Hearing
1819
1       Michael Cohen recently, certain Mea Culpa Podcasts, recent
2       ones, and I don't believe every one since the Gag Order,
3       but recently, and then certain video transcripts from news
4       programs regarding Mr. Pecker's testimony, the jury
5       composition and Mr. Cohen himself.
6                 And I am not going to go through all of them.  I
7       am going to highlight a few of them, before I offer them
8       up, and I also -- I have a thumb drive with all of them.
9                 THE COURT:  Okay.
10                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
11                      (Whereupon, documents and a thumb drive were
12                 handed to the Court and the People.)

15                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.

17                 MR. BLANCHE:  The additional exhibits are in

19       Order on Tuesday, because your Honor made plain in the
20       Order recognizing that there would be opportunity, and it
21       may be necessary to allow -- to remove certain people from
22       the Gag Order if they didn't need to be protected.  That's
23       the reason that we are coming at it late, your Honor.
24                 So I am going to go in a little bit reverse Order
25       and talk about Mr. Pecker, the alleged violation regarding

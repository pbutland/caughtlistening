1 this case?
2 A The stated liquidated damages in this contract was
3 $1 million dollars.
4 Q And is that $1 million dollars per breach?
5 A Yes.
6 Q Was it unusual to have liquidated damages that were so
7 much greater than the original payment under the NDA?
8 A I believe that this paragraph, the way that it was
9 drafted, was unenforceable; yes.
10 Q You believe it was unenforceable; why?
11 A I —— because the Liquidated Damages Provision would
12 have no relation to the damages caused if there was a breach.
13 The $1 million dollars —— there needs to be a rational
14 relationship between the expected damages in the case of a
15 breach of contract, and the Liquidated Damages Provision are
16 included in contracts where the expected damages, were there to
17 be a breach, would be difficult to ascertain.
18 And they should be reasonably related to the underlying
19 amount of the contract.
20 And, here, a Liquidated Damages Provision of $1 million
21 dollars, which was demanded by Michael Cohen, was so far in
22 excess of the —— of the settlement amount of the contract that
23 it really served no purpose.
24 Q And I believe you answered this, but who requested such
25 large liquidated damages?

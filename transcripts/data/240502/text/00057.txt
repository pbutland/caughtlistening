1       A    To Michael Cohen.  Yes, to Michael Cohen.
2       Q    And why did you do that?
3       A    Because we had a mutuality of interest at this period
4   of time.
5       Q    Can you explain that a little bit to the jury?
6       A    Well, we had a fully executed Settlement Agreement and
7   Confidentiality Agreement, and now the underlying matter that
8   was the subject of that Settlement Agreement/Confidentiality
9   Agreement was about to be published, and I think I had a
10   contractual duty to let him know that something was about to be
11   published.
12       And we had sort of -- we were acting in unison to address
13   it.
14       Q    Okay.  So I want to now show you what has been
15   privately -- what has been marked for identification as People's
16   Exhibit --
17                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Privately, please, thank you.
18       Q    What has been marked for identification as People's
19   Exhibit 255.
20                (Displayed only to those previously-described.)
21       Q    Do you recognize this exhibit?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    What is it?
24       A    I believe that these are -- it's a database of
25   messaging between Michael Cohen and I.

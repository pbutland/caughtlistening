1       Q    Okay.
2       And what did you understand it to mean?
3       A    Well, I took it to mean that he was watching Stormy
4   Daniels on Kimmel, and that he was reporting to me what was
5   being broadcast.
6       Q    So, who do you understand "she" to be in reference to?
7       A    Stormy Daniels.
8       Q    What is the next text in this chain, from whom to
9   whom?
10       A    From Michael Cohen to me:  "Claiming it's not her
11   signature."
12       Q    Keep going, please.
13       A    "You said she did it in front of you."
14       Q    I should just ask, this series of texts that's up on
15   the screen, are these sent within fairly rapid succession, all
16   within a five-minute window?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And I believe you testified that you understood this
19   to be happening while Michael Cohen was watching Stormy Daniels
20   appearing on the Kimmel show; correct?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    So, what do you understand it to mean when Michael
23   Cohen said to you, "You said she did it in front of you"?
24       A    Um, that he was repeating something I had previously
25   told him, which is that that most recent statement was signed

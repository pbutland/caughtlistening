1   right?
2       A    That was not my concern.
3       Q    Do you recall being asked about this issue in meetings
4   in 2023 by the District Attorney's Office?
5       A    I do not.
6       Q    Do you recall a meeting where you indicated that you
7   could not recall whether the thought of election as a deadline
8   for getting stuff done had come up?
9       A    You're asking me --
10       Q    Do you remember saying that?
11       A    I remember saying I do not recall.
12       Q    And it's your testimony that you -- even today, you
13   don't remember whether or not you were concerned about linking
14   the election in these payments?
15       A    Correct.
16       Q    You said on Tuesday that in the timeframe 2015 to
17   2017, your focus was on, I think you said, media cases; right?
18       A    Somewhat.
19       Q    And you also testified that you agreed with
20   Mr. Steinglass, that those cases frequently involved
21   Non-Disclosure Agreements; do you remember that?
22       A    Fair.
23       Q    And in terms of media practices and the types of work
24   that you were doing in 2015 through 2017, there's nothing out
25   of the ordinary about a NDA agreement; correct?

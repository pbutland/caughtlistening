K. Davidson - Redirect/Steinglass
1972
1       Can you take a look at that one, please?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And he asked you if you said: "I wouldn't be the least
4   bit surprised if he comes out and says" -- let me just stop
5   myself for one second to ask, who is "he" in that?
6       A    Anthony Kotsev.
7       Q    Okay.
8       "I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out and says: You know
9   what, Stormy Daniels, she wanted this money more than you could
10   ever imagine. I remember hearing her on the phone saying, you,
11   fucking Keith Davidson, you better settle this goddamn story
12   because if he loses this election, and he's going to lose, if
13   he loses this election, then we lose all fucking leverage and
14   this case is worth zero."
15       Mr. Bove asked you if you were discussing the Stormy
16   Daniels case when you said these things to Michael Cohen?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    Are you at all saying that Stormy Daniels said those
19   things?
20       A    It was my understanding at the time that -- that this
21   was April 4th, and that Anthony Kotsev was about to give a
22   media interview, in sum and substance, in alignment with this
23   text.
24       Q    Just to be very clear, you were not telling Michael
25   Cohen that Stormy Daniels was talking about the election and

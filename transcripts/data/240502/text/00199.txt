5   BY MR. CONROY:
6       Q    And can you tell us, what does that metadata tell us
7   about that picture?
8       If you could sort of explain that as you walk through the
9   columns?
10       A    All right.  So you have modified time, created time,
11   access time.
12       They are all on February 8th of 2017 at approximately
13   5:39 p.m.
14       Q    Okay.  And what does each of those things mean?
15       A    It just means that those are the dates, the times that
16   existed on that phone.
17       Q    Okay.  And does that mean that's when that photo was
18   created?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Okay.
21                 MR. CONROY:  If we could now pull up what's in
22        evidence as People's 254.
23                 And if you could blow that up a little bit.
24                 (Displayed.)
25       Q    Is this a copy of a calendar invite?

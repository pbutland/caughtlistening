3   Graykey is another one.

17   your call history, your contacts, your text messages, videos,
18   pictures and such.
19       Q    In that process, is any of the data on the phone
20   changed in any way?
21       A    We're dealing with a live phone, so perhaps some
22   things in the background like software. But, for all intents
23   and purposes, things do not change.

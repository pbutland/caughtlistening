1       A.   I believe so.
2       Q.   By that time, there was someone else leaking
3   information publicly about this alleged relationship between Ms.
4   McDougal and President Trump, right?
5       A.   I don't know about that, about leaking.  Ms. McDougal
6   had a friend, and when your client was ascending in the polls,
7   one of Ms. McDougal's former friends attempted to publicize
8   Ms. McDougal's interactions with your client.
9       Q.   That is Gary Stevens, right?
10       A.   I don't know.
11       Q.   Do you remember telling the District Attorney's office
12   that Ms. McDougal had a friend who was trying to publish a story
13   without her consent?
14       A.   Telling whom?
15       Q.   That there was a friend of Ms. McDougal's who was
16   trying to publish a story without her consent?
17       A.   Who did I say that to?
18       Q.   The District Attorney's office.
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   At the time, you said that you knew who you were
21   talking about, right?
22       A.   I don't know if I ever heard that name Stevens.
23       Q.   I think you testified on direct that your fee in
24   connection with the representation of Ms. McDougal is 45
25   percent; is that right?

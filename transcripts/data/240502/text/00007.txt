Jury Trial - Hearing
1810
1       witness, but on other witnesses.  It is an insidious thing.
2                 I will talk a little bit more about Michael Cohen
3       in a moment.
4                 Moving to the -- and, again, in that statement he
5       is talking both about Michael Cohen and his credibility,
6       which is a theme here, and then about David Pecker, who is
7       the witness on the stand.
8                 Finally, I will move on to the first statement in
9       the Order to Show Cause, which is Exhibit E from the April
10       25th Affirmation.  That was made also on April 22nd,
11       earlier in the day than the statement I just talked about.
12                 And I know I said this the other day, that this
13       statement was made right outside of these doors, the doors
14       of this courtroom in the little pen that's set up where he
15       speaks to the gathered media everyday.
16                 He stood there for almost nine minutes and he
17       talked about a prospective witness that was going to be in
18       this courtroom at some date in the future, Michael Cohen.
19                 What he said was, and it's two different
20       excerpts:
21                 But, they called the payment to a lawyer a legal
22       expense in the books.  They didn't call it construction.
23       They didn't say you are building a building.  They called
24       it a payment to a lawyer because, as you know, Cohen is a
25       lawyer, represented a lot of people over the years.

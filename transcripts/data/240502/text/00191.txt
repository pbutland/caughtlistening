1   266 contain exact copies of data extracted from CP1 or CP2?
2       A    Yes, they do.
3                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, at this time I'd like to
4        offer as -- into evidence People's 246, 247, 249 to 254,
5        256 to 264, and 266.

9                 (Whereupon, the aforementioned exhibits are
10        received in evidence.)
11       Q    Now, I want to, first, talk about the group exhibits,
12   numbers 249 to 251, 255, which was already in evidence, 257 to
13   260, and 262.
14       Are each of those Cellebrite reports created from the
15   extraction that you did on CP1?
16       A    Yes, they are.
17       Q    And are they all text messages with Michael Cohen as
18   one of the parties?  And with respect to each of the exhibits,
19   are different parties corresponding with Michael Cohen?
20       A    Yes, they are.
21       Q    I would like to pull up an example just to go through
22   what a report looks like.
23                 MR. CONROY:   You can pull this up for everybody.
24        You can pull up People's 259.
25                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)

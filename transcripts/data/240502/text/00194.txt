1                 MR. CONROY:  If we could now pull up People's 263
2        in evidence.
3                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
4       Q    Is this a report of contacts from CP1?
5       A    Yes, it is.
6       Q    How many contacts were in -- on CP1?
7       A    39,745.
8       Q    Is that unusual?
9       A    That is unusual.
10       Q    In what way?
11       A    I've not seen contacts -- that many being on a phone.
12       Q    What would be a more -- what would be an average
13   number of contacts that you would see when you do this kind of
14   examination of a phone?
15       A    Maybe hundreds.
16       Q    Hundreds.
17       Maybe thousands?
18       A    Thousands. A thousand, at the most.
19                 MR. CONROY:  Can we pull up a few examples of the
20        contacts from the phone?
21                 First, could we pull up -- this is three pages of
22        contacts that were on CP1 for David Pecker.
23                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
24       Q    Is that what that is?
25       A    Yes.

1   Daniels, approximately?
2       A    (Pause.)  I fear that that invades attorney-client
3   privilege.
4       I disbursed everything other than my attorney fees.
5       Q    So let me ask you this, did you also, without invading
6   attorney-client privilege, did you also disburse some of the
7   money to Gina Rodriguez?
8       A    I disbursed everything to -- pursuant to my client's
9   directives, her net aspect of the settlement pursuant to her
10   directive.
11       Q    Okay.  So directing your attention to November of 2016.
12   Did there come a time when the Agreement between Karen McDougal

15       Q    Do you remember how that happened?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    How?
18       A    Well, I -- I should clarify.
19       Q    Let me ask you that a different way.  I don't want to
20   ask you to invade any privilege.
21       Was there an article that was published in a particular
22   publication?
23       A    There was an article published in the Wall Street
24   Journal that initially publicized the underlying contract
25   between Karen McDougal and AMI.

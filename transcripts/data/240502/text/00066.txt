K. Davidson - Direct/Steinglass

1   pushing for that?
2       A    A few minutes ago, we discussed the -- Michael Cohen's
3   request for me to write a strong denial the way that I did way
4   back then.
5       And what he was referring to, I think, was the letter that I
6   sent to The Dirty in 2011.
7       But there was no denial in the -- in the Cease and Desist
8   demand that I sent to The Dirty in 2011.  And that as a fact was
9   just wrong.
10       And then I sent him the exhibit that we just looked at,
11   which was sort of that carefully worded denial.
12       And I believe that he thought that her -- he, Michael Cohen,
13   thought that Stormy going on Hannity, which -- would somehow
14   help him and his client.
15       I believe that I -- I had an understanding that he believed
16   that she would further deny the interaction.
17       Q    Okay.  Moving on to another text that I want to bring
18   to your attention.
19       And this is the one beginning "Keith, the wise men," okay.
20   What was the date that this text was sent and who was it sent
21   from and who was it sent to?
22       A    It was January 17th, 2018, from Michael Cohen to me.
23       Q    And what does it say?
24       A    "Keith, the wise men all believe the story is dying and
25   don't think it's smart for her to do any interviews."  Period.

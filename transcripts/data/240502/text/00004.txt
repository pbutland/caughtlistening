Jury Trial - Hearing
1807
1       creates an air of menace that is substantially different
2       from a media report.  By talking about the jury at all, he
3       places this process and this proceeding here in jeopardy.
4                 That is what the Order forbids, and he did it
5       anyway.
6                 I will move on to the second violation that we

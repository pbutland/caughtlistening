1       Q.   Now, you testified about some public statements that
2   Ms. Daniels made in January 2018, correct?
3       A.   Yes.
4       Q.   At around this time, Larry Flynt offered to indemnify
5   Stormy Daniels in connection with any litigation arising out of
6   the Settlement Agreement, correct?
7       A.   There were others.  I was not involved.  It's my
8   understanding there were other terms as well.
9       Q.   But one of the terms, if there was going to be
10   litigation relating to the Settlement Agreement that you helped
11   to negotiate, he would indemnify her?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Indemnify means he would be paying her legal bills,
14   correct?
15       A.   True.
16       Q.   You testified this morning about some stress that you
17   perceived Ms. Daniels to be going through in January 2018
18   relating to this agreement, right?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   In fact, she had this opportunity to have her legal
21   fees paid if she wanted to fight the Agreement, right?
22       A.   Yes.  But you can -- even if someone is going to pay
23   your legal bills, it's still an obstruction in your life.  Yes.
24       Q.   From your perspective, this Settlement Agreement was a
25   valid legal document, right?

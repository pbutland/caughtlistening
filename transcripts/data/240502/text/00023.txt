Jury Trial - Hearing
1826
1       mean, he has been -- David's been very nice, a nice guy.
2                 And, again, he is responding to a question.
3                 Mr. Pecker had been on the stand for two days at
4       this point.  The Government says that that's threatening
5       and a warning to witnesses that they need to be nice.
6                 That's just not true.  He is just responding to a
7       question and saying he has been very nice.
8                 Your Honor observed his testimony.  There is no
9       animosity between the two of them.  There were no
10       threatening or menacing statements.
11                 Again, Mr. Pecker himself testified about their
12       friendship and the relationship, and he would call him
13       Donald and that he had a great relationship with President
14       Trump over the years.
15                 And we, again, put multiple articles in front of
16       the Court, again, not to compare, or not to say that that
17       alone gives President Trump the right to say something, but
18       when the Court is considering whether the purpose of the
19       Gag Order was frustrated by, he has been very nice.  I
20       mean, he has been -- David's been very nice, it does
21       matter.
22                 THE COURT:  Just to save you time, I am not
23       terribly concerned with that one.
24                 I think that there are situations where comments
25       like that could be of much greater concern.

1   connection with the incident I just described?
2       A    No.
3       Q    So, she was your client in connection with the
4   incident I just described; correct?
5       A    Well, you're describing a few different incidents.
6       I don't know what you're recalling -- what you're referring
7   to.
8       Q    What I am referring to is the posting of information
9   regarding Ms. Lohan on TMZ, and that information related to her
10   treatment at a rehab facility.
11       A    I don't recall that.
12       Q    And you don't recall Ms. Holland getting paid $10,000
13   by TMZ?
14       A    I don't recall that.
15       Q    Do you know who Tila Tequila is?
16       A    I do.
17       Q    And in 2010, you took steps to broker -- steps to
18   broker a deal of a sex tape involving her; correct?
19       A    I believe so.
20       Q    And you were working on that -- what should I call it
21   -- "engagement" -- with a man named Kevin Black?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    And at the time, he was sort of known as a sex tape
24   broker; is that right?
25       A    I think that's fair.

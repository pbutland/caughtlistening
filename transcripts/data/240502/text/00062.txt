1   technically be true.
2       Q    Can you explain that?  How is this technically true?
3       A    Well, I think you have to go through it word by word,
4   and it would -- if you did so, I think it would technically be
5   true with an extremely fine reading of it.
6       Q    So let me direct you to two parts in particular.
7       The first two sentences, when it states that she -- that
8   Ms. Daniels was contacted by certain news outlets alleging that
9   she had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump, many,
10   many, many years ago and then it states that that's absolutely
11   false.
12       How is that technically correct?
13       A    Well, I think you would have to hone in on the
14   definition of romantic, sexual and affair.
15       Q    Okay.  Can you explain that?
16       A    Well, I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that
17   any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic.
18       Q    Okay.  How about sexual?
19       A    Well, that would be a sexual and/or romantic.
20       Q    Okay.  So let me just zoom out for a second and say,
21   did you understand this statement to be cleverly misleading?
22       A    I don't understand the question.
23       Q    Did you understand, at the time that you wrote this
24   letter, that Stormy Daniels had, in fact, had a sexual encounter
25   with Donald Trump at some point?

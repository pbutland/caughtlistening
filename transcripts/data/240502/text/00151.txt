Davidson - Cross/Bove
1954
1   the impression that he did record some of these talks?"
2       A.   Certainly, I recall a few conversations when I was
3   speaking with Mr. Cohen when his conversations were odd, and
4   that led me to believe that I was being recorded.
5       Q.   I think you said the reason they seemed odd to you, he
6   was talking in a linear fashion?
7       A.   Yes.  Because, ordinarily, he was sort of all over the
8   place.  In these particular calls, it was a very structured
9   conversation, which really wasn't his personality.
10       Q.   Less pants on fire, more straightforward?
11       A.   Maybe a little bit more self-serving.
12       Q.   Do you recall saying to Michael Cohen on March 7, 2018,
13   "Sometimes people get settler's remorse, you know, and other
14   times people think that, hey, I need to resolve this case
15   before a date certain because this is when I have the most?"
16       A.   No.
17                 MR. BOVE:  If we can bring up for the parties, the
18        Court and the witness, Defense Exhibit F15-AT.
19                 There is also a set of headphones on the bench.
20        I think the way this works, there is a dial in the middle.
21                 I'm told if you put the volume up above two,
22        there's a risk of catastrophic damage to your ears.
23                 Thank you.
24       Q.   So we're going to play Defense Exhibit F158A over the
25   headphones.

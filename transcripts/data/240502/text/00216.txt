2019
1 pictures of what's on the screen?
2 A Yes.
3 Q And this is, would you say, the least sophisticated way
4 to acquire data from an electronic device?
5 A The less sophisticated.
6 Q And so you can't access metadata in a meaningful way;
7 correct?
8 A No, you can't.
9 Q And you can't recover items deleted by the user; right?
10 A You cannot.
11 Q You can't look at the coding of specific files, like an
12 image that you see on a phone; right?
13 A No.
14 Q So there are other ways to do this; correct?
15 A There are.
16 Q And another one is a logical extraction?
17 A Uh—huh.
18 Q And so for a logical extraction, you are pulling the
19 data off of the device, sort of in the same format that it looks
20 —— the same way Windows looks, right, a folder, a hierarchical
21 formation; right?
22 A Files, yes.
23 Q What was that?
24 A Files.
25 Q I didn't hear you.

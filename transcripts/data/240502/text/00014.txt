Jury Trial - Hearing
1817
1       am referring to today, I believe, are recent, recent
2       exhibits that bear on the four charged counts.
3                 But, Judge, I -- I do think it's appropriate when
4       the Court's considering whether there has been a willful
5       violation of the Gag Order beyond a reasonable doubt, to
6       keep in perspective beyond just the Gag Order, your Honor
7       did that in reaching the conclusions.
8                 That's what I am talking about today.  That's it.
9                 THE COURT:  I am telling you what I am going to
10       consider when I make my decision.  You can do that.
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, last weekend -- last
12       weekend, President Trump's rival, President Biden, said in
13       a public forum, he talked about this trial, and he talked
14       about a witness that's going to be in this trial.
15                 He mocked President Trump.
16                 He said, Donald has had a few tough days lately.
17       You might call it stormy weather.
18                 Okay.  President Trump can't respond to that in
19       the way that he would want to because of this Gag Order.
20                 Stormy weather, as everyone --
21                 THE COURT:  Where --
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  It's one of our exhibits, your
23       Honor.
24                 Stormy weather was an obvious reference to Stormy
25       Daniels.

K. Davidson - Cross/Bove
1916
1                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
2                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
3       Q    In connection with that representation, Charlie Sheen
4   paid $2 million; right?
5       A    I have no -- I'm not gonna answer that question.
6       Q    You're -- $2 million was paid to your client; correct?
7       A    I don't recall.
8       Q    Is it fair to say that your memory seems a little
9   fuzzy around some of these issues?
10       A    I've had over 1500 clients in my career.
11       You're asking me about events that took place many, many
12   years ago.
13       Q    A $2 million payment is a typical payout for you on
14   one of these cases, so much so that you don't remember it; is
15   that your testimony?
16       A    I don't remember a settlement from 13 years ago.
17       Q    What about Capri Anderson?  Do you remember her?
18       A    I do remember her.
19       Q    And do you remember extracting another settlement from
20   Mr. Sheen while representing her?
21       A    Again, it was no extraction.
22       Q    You got Mr. Sheen to pay; correct?
23       A    Assuming arguendo that he did pay and there was a
24   Settlement Agreement, that settlement would be confidential,
25   and I would not discuss it here.

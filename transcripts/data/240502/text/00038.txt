4   CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
5   BY MR. STEINGLASS:
6       Q    I now want to pull back up Exhibit 176-A, which is in
7   evidence, and display Page 12, Lines 536 to 537.
8       Is this a part of that long series of texts between yourself
9   and Dylan Howard?
10                 (Displayed.)
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And are these two that we've blown up, what is the date
13   on these texts?
14       A    October 27th, 2016.
15       Q    What do the texts say?
16       A    From Dylan Howard to me:  "Money wired I am told."
17       Q    Did you have an understanding as to who told Dylan
18   Howard that the funds had been wired?
19       A    I -- I assumed that it was Michael Cohen.  He was the
20   only other one involved.
21       Q    And what about your response?
22       A    "Funds received."
23       Q    And did you, in fact, receive these funds as a wire
24   from Essential Consultants on October 27th, 2016 into your
25   escrow account?

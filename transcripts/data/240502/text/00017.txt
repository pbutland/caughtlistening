Jury Trial - Hearing
1820
1       statements about Mr. Pecker.
2                 So what President Trump said, David Pecker, I
3       don't know exactly what he is going to be testifying about,
4       but he will be testifying today.
5                 So, that was a recording, as the Government just
6       said, on April 23rd, for a news show in Philadelphia.  It
7       aired about six o'clock that evening.
8                 That was in response to a question from the
9       interviewer saying, where is your concern level at this
10       point regarding David Pecker's testimony and Michael Cohen,
11       but focusing on David Pecker for now?
12                 Where is your concern level?
13                 President Trump sidestepped the question.  He
14       gave a very factual, truthful answer.  It wasn't a warning.
15       It wasn't a commentary on what Mr. Pecker had testified
16       about, and, certainly, it was not a willful violation.
17                 I mean, he is -- he is talking, as the Court
18       knows from the testimony, about a man that he has known for
19       decades.  He is talking about a man who he was friends with
20       for decades.
21                 There is no threat.  There is no threat in what
22       President Trump said, and we cited ten.  There are multiple
23       articles.  We cited ten of them in our papers, news
24       articles that are going into excruciating details about Mr.
25       Pecker's testimony.

Jury Trial - Hearing
1812
1       about things Michael Cohen has said in the weeks and months
2       before defendant's statements at issue here.
3                 There is mention of TikToks more recently, and
4       now, I will talk about the exhibits, the 50-plus exhibits,
5       500 pages of documents that were filed with Defense papers.
6                 But, there is nothing to indicate that the
7       Defendant saw those statements when they were made.  This
8       Order has only been in effect for four to five weeks, not
9       months.
10                 Michael Cohen is not a political opponent.
11       Defendant's comments about Michael Cohen relate to issues
12       at the heart of this proceeding and Michael Cohen's
13       participation in the proceeding.
14                 They don't relate to political policies or goals
15       of the Defendant.  The Defendant is doing everything he can
16       to make this case and the proceeding about his politics.
17       It's not.  It's about his criminal conduct.
18                 His statements are corrosive to this proceeding
19       and to the fair administration of justice.
20                 As your Honor knows, we just did this the other
21       day.  What we have to prove here is the existence of a
22       lawful Order expressing an ongoing mandate, which I submit
23       is very clear here based on the Court's previous decision
24       and other litigation on this very issue.
25                 We have to show a violation of that Order, and

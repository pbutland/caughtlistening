Jury Trial - Hearing
1811
1                 I am not the only one and wasn't very good in a
2       lot of ways in terms of his representation, but he
3       represented a lot of people.
4                 But, he puts in an invoice, or whatever, a bill,
5       and they pay, and they call it a legal expense.  I got
6       indicted for that.
7                 Later the Defendant went on, quote, and when are
8       they going to look at all the lines that Cohen did in the
9       last trial?
10                 He got caught lying in the last trial.  He got
11       caught lying, pure lying.  And when are they going to look
12       at that?
13                 This and all of these are clearly related to this
14       proceeding.  They are clearly willful.  The Defendant is
15       talking about witnesses and the jury in this case, one
16       right here outside the door, all during the trial.
17                 This is the most critical time, the time the
18       proceeding needs to be protected, where -- particularly
19       where Defendant has demonstrated over time, and recently,
20       his willingness to say and do anything he can to try to
21       infect and disrupt this process.  That's what the Defendant
22       has tried to do and continues to try to do.
23                 We understand the Court's concern about Michael
24       Cohen, but in the statements at issue here, the Defendant
25       wasn't responding to anything in particular.  He talks

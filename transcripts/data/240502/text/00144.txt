1       A.   In addition to the Cease and Desist.
2       Q.   You practiced law for a long time, right?
3       A.   Yes.
4       Q.   You won cases in court?
5       A.   Yes.
6       Q.   This Cease and Desist Letter was not one of your
7   greatest litigation victories?
8       A.   It was a form letter.
9       Q.   It was a form letter created in that context because
10   you had connections to The Dirty?
11       A.   I certainly followed the Cease and Desist up with a
12   phone call.
13       Q.   Isn't it a fact that the reason that Ms. Daniels and
14   Ms. Rodriguez wanted that blog post taken down, they were trying
15   to negotiate a better deal with In Touch magazine?
16       A.   That's a fact that I learned later, yes.
17       Q.   They were using you in connection with them?
18       A.   I don't understand your question.  They were using my
19   efforts to create an exclusive opportunity with a different
20   publication.
21       Q.   And that exclusive opportunity was more valuable to
22   Ms. Daniels, right?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   They were using you to make more money, right?
25       A.   Yes.

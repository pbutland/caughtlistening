1       Can you explain that a little bit more?
2       What did you mean when you say:  "What have we done?"
3       A    I think that there was an understanding that this is a
4   text between Dylan Howard and I, and that there was an
5   understanding that our efforts may have in some way -- I should
6   strike that.
7       That our activities may have in some way assisted the
8   presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
9       Q    And how did Dylan Howard respond to your text?
10       A    "Oh my God."
11       Q    After the election -- I should ask you the obvious
12   question:  Who won the election?
13       A    Donald Trump.
14       Q    After the election, did you continue to speak with
15   Michael Cohen?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    Did -- well, did there come any times during the month
18   or two that followed the election when the topic of the Stormy
19   Daniels deal came up?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Can you tell the jury a little bit about that?
22       A    Ummm, after the election, Michael Cohen called me
23   fairly frequently.
24       And there was one particular day, it was on a weekend in
25   mid-December, and this is the period of time after the election,

Jury Trial - Hearing
1830
1       attack.
2                 I mean, there are repeated reports and, indeed,
3       they are true, that Mr. Cohen has been shopping television
4       shows based upon, not only what he did for President Trump,
5       but also what he has been doing here.  And he is talking
6       about that and advertising what he is trying to do.
7                 And then, again, there is multiple examples of
8       this in our exhibits.
9                 If we can bring up page 37 -- Exhibit 37, page
10       seven, this is an April 12th, political article quoting
11       Mr. Cohen, talking extensively about President Trump's
12       candidacy for President, criticizing him, as someone that
13       should not be voted for.
14                 On the same article, next page, it says, Donald
15       does not know how to tell the truth.  He lied so many
16       times.  He can't keep track of the lies.
17                 And then just, very briefly, your Honor, and I
18       hope the point has been made, but we --
19                 THE COURT:  You made your point.  You made your
20       point.
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  Well, okay.
22                 But, I mean, on top of everything that I just put
23       in, there is multiple examples of the Mea Culpa Podcast
24       that are over the top, about his character, about his
25       candidacy for President, including multiple interviews with

1 A Yes.
2 Q Those are the ones that passed muster, from your
3 perspective?
4 A I would like to think they all did.
5 Q Right.
6 The ones that were produced before the trial?
7 A Yes.
8 Q Just so we’re clear, the ones that are in evidence now
9 are not actually summaries of every toll between the
10 participants on the chart; right?
11 A No. That would be tens of hundreds of thousands of
12 calls.
13 Q Just as an example, going to Exhibit 337 is a call
14 summary chart, calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson.
15 A Yes.
16 Q And the one that’s admitted in evidence is not a
17 summary of every toll that you have between those two
18 individuals; right?
19 A Right.
20 We narrowed down by a time period.
21 Q So, there were some deletions from the charts made
22 this week; right?
23 A Uh, I guess so.
24 Q When you say "narrowed down", some things were cut?
25 A Yes.

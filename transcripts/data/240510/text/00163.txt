1                 This is done. This is done with some frequency.
2                 I've had people produced from jail testify. I've
3        had other people, who were unwilling to, testify.
4                 But, the only way to know that is to put them on
5        the stand, out of the presence of the jury, on the record,
6        under oath.
7                 MR. BOVE:  My point is slightly different, is
8        that even if Mr. Weisselberg came to this trial and was
9        now willing to testify for any number of reasons he might

22        of stating the obvious, regarding the Gag Order.
23                 Mr. Cohen continues to speak publicly about this
24        trial and about President Trump.

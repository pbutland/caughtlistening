1 Thank you.
2 Q It wasn't a new work—around that you all came up with;
3 was it?
4 Was it your understanding that this problem with getting
5 items promptly to the President of the United States existed for
6 everybody who is in that Office?
7 MS. MANGOLD: Objection.
8 THE COURT: Overruled.
9 A I don't have any knowledge of what it was like in
10 previous administrations, but I can't imagine it would have been
11 any different.
12 Q Now, when you received —— you know, just focusing ——
13 when you received whatever packages there was, you would give
14 them to President Trump or to the First Lady; correct?
15 A Yes.
16 Q And you had nothing to do with giving documents or
17 packages to Ms. Trump, Ivanka Trump?
18 A No, uh—uh.
19 Q And do you know how she got them?
20 A Ummm, I don't.
21 Q And you would leave whatever items came for President
22 Trump on his desk; right?
23 A That's right.
24 Q And with respect to the checks, they came in a folder;
25 am I correct?

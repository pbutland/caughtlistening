1                 You should feel free to start submitting any
2        special instructions that you want.
3                 We will definitely have a pre-charge conference
4        at the appropriate time. I will make my final decisions
5        then.
6                 You can start bringing matters to my attention
7        now, if you like.
8                 Tell me about scheduling for next week.
9                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Um, we expect to call --
10                 THE COURT:  Two witnesses?
11                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
12                 Potentially, two witnesses; and I think it's
13        entirely possible that we will rest by the end of next
14        week.
15                 THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Also, there was one other
17        evidentiary matter that Mr. Conroy wanted to raise with
18        the Court if this is a good time.
19                 THE COURT:  Sure. It is.
20                 MR. CONROY:  This relates to an exhibit numbered
21        People's 79, which is a copy of a Severance Agreement for
22        Allen Weisselberg.
23                 We've had, I think, some conversation with
24        Counsel about this.
25                 My understanding -- but I'm sure they'll let me

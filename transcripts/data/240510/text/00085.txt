1 private contract between two parties, known as a Non—Disclosure
2 Agreement or NDA. These agreements are —— dot, dot, dot.
3 MS. MANGOLD: Then move to the second post to the
4 thread.
5 A Very common amongst celebrities and people of wealth.
6 In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in
7 arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford, Daniels. The
8 agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist
9 accusations made by her about an affair ——
10 Q And is this now the final post in the thread?
11 A Yes.
12 Despite already having signed a detailed letter
13 admitting that there was no affair, prior to its violation by
14 Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement.
15 Money for the campaign or campaign contributions played no role
16 in this transaction.
17 MS. MANGOLD: Thank you.
18 Can we take that down, please?
19 Now, can we show everyone what's already in
20 evidence as People’s Exhibit, 171 A?
21 Q Ms. Longstreet, do you recognize this?
22 A Yes.
23 Q And how do you recognize it?
24 A This was something that the paralegal team had to
25 analyze in response to subpoena compliance.

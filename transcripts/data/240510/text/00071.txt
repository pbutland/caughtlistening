1       excerpt of an -- excuse me, excerpt of an interview of
2       President Trump by Larry King in 1999.
3                 And, in substance, there is a question, what are
4       your views on campaign finance reform?
5                 And part of what President Trump said in response
6       to that in 1999 is that he is very experienced with the
7       campaign finance laws, and I think the clip is limited to
8       just about that.
9                 Our position is that that is not relevant with
10       respect to President Trump's state of mind in 2016 and 2017
11       because there has been extensive revisions to the campaign
12       finance laws in the intervening period, both statutory and
13       in the Supreme Court.
14                 Whatever President Trump may have said in 1999
15       about his knowledge of the campaign finance laws is not
16       probative of his state of mind in 2016 and 2017.
17                 MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, we disagree.  We think
18       that Defendant's admission that he has extensive knowledge
19       of campaign finance laws is obviously directly relevant to
20       the case.
21                 We understand that there were, as Mr. Bove noted,
22       extensive changes to campaign finance laws in 2002.  We
23       believe that's a reference to the McCain/Feingold Act.
24                 However, the separate contribution ban, which is
25       the one that's relevant here, has been part of campaign

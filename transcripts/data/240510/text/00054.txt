D. Dixon - Cross/Bove
3142
1   looking at, what that suggests is that the subscriber
2   information we are looking at begins on that period?
3       A    We would have to look in the other boxes because this
4   is -- the status change history only shows changes of the
5   account.  So, it could have been created before and something
6   took place on January 23, 2017.
7       Q    Right.  The account could have been created before and
8   then the phone number transitioned onto this account by a cross
9   market move?
10       A    Possibly.
11       Q    Do you want to look at a different piece of this page
12   to try to figure that out?
13       A    Could you zoom back out?
14            So, it was -- it would seem as if on January 23rd, the
15   number left this account.
16                 MR. BOVE:  And if we can zoom back in on that
17       box, please.
18                 Thank you.
19       Q    Do you see that the top two rows, contract accepted
20   and contract acceptance required?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    What does that indicate?
23       A    I am not familiar with it.
24                 MR. BOVE:  Now, we can take that down.
25                 Thank you.

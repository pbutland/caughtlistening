I And this is not even your witness.
2 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, of course, I did.
3 I, of course, I tried to present it to her.
4 THE COURT: This is something that the People asked
5 for months before this trial, that you did not give notice
6 of, what the exhibits were that you were going to use.
7 So for two reasons I'm keeping it out:
8 Reason number one, you should have given it to the
9 People. You did not present it to them prior to her
10 testifying.
ll And, two, her answers are far from that which she
12 can establish this as a business record.
13 I'm not allowing it in.
14 MR. BOVE: Judge, may I respond on one issue?
15 We are getting the flip side of this with exhibits
16 that are being created and sent to us the night before.
17 Judge, they are summarily giving us exhibits in
18 that way ——
19 THE COURT: We can discuss that later.
20 MR. BOVE: —— so it should be reciprocal.
21 THE COURT: We can discuss that later.
22 (Side bar concluded.)

J. Jarmel-Schneider - Redirect/Conroy
3233
1                 MR. CONROY:  If we could pull up what we were
2        just looking at, the page from People's 400 with the Bates
3        ending 2726.
4                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
5                 MR. CONROY:  If we could pull up the same two
6        lines we were just looking at, 26191 and 92.
7                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
8       Q    I believe, earlier, or just a minute or two ago on
9   cross-examination, there was something you wanted to explain
10   about what you saw in this call that interrupted the call
11   that's in evidence as 246.
12       Can you explain that for us?
13       A    Sure.
14       So, Mr. Bove -- Bove -- sorry -- asked me if these were two
15   related calls and if the first one was a missed call.
16       My understanding is this was one call that had two legs.
17   I'm not sure exactly where it went. But, this is how AT&T
18   reported a single call that hit multiple stop points through
19   their system before being connected.
20       That was the clarification.
21       Q    Okay.
22       If you know, do people sometimes get new phones and keep
23   the same phone number?
24       A    I do.
25       Q    Meaning, you do get a new phone and keep the same

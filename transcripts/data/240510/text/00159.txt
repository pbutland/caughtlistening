1                 THE COURT:  You referred to how "both sides" are
2        having difficulty with this issue.
3                 MR. BOVE:  If I said it that way, I mis -- my
4        point is, I think there's an equally shared access issue.
5                 They have chosen to call or not call him.
6                 We, obviously, have no burden here.
7                 We have not taken steps to try and call him at
8        this trial.
9                 It's just -- it would not resolve the situation
10        if we stipulated that he was in prison for perjury.
11                 I think it actually further supports my
12        point, which is, there are a host of reasons that
13        Mr. Weisselberg is not going to be a witness in this case.
14                 They, the Government, have chosen to not take
15        steps to call him.
16                 It's a very complicated situation.
17                 It's not completely explained by this document.
18                 It would be misleading to allow this document in
19        by itself.
20                 It would be further prejudicial -- I'm not
21        suggesting your Honor is requiring for us to stipulate --
22        for us to stipulate to some negotiated statement about the
23        perjury situation.
24                 And we think that all of this is sort of a
25        sideshow for somebody that is -- the Government's hearsay

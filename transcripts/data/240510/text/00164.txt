1 was on TikTok, this time talking extensively about —— he
2 was wearing a white T—shirt with a picture of President
3 Trump behind bars, wearing an orange jumpsuit, and
4 discussing about how he’s now announcing he’s running for
5 Congress.
6 Our request is, now that we have one week left in
7 the trial, that he be prohibited from talking. The same
8 way President Trump is.
9 The case law speaks to your Honor having the
10 power to do this.
11 Sheppard v. Maxwell explicitly states: There may
12 be instances where the Court not only needs to stop
13 extrajudicial statements from the parties and the lawyers,
14 but also from the witnesses or court officials.
15 Your Honor, it's Friday. We have a couple of days
16 left.
17 It’s now becoming —— it's becoming a problem
18 every single day that President Trump is not allowed to
19 respond to this witness, but this witness is allowed to
20 continue to talk.
21 He has stated on social media that he’s going to
22 stop talking a couple of different times, and he doesn’t.
23 So, our request is that the Court order —— order
24 the Government to instruct the witness to not talk about
25 President Trump or —— or this case until the case is over.

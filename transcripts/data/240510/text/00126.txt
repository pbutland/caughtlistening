J.Jarmel-Schneider - Direct/Conroy
3214
1                 MR. CONROY:  You said your objection --
2                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, this is unduly argumentative.
3                 MR. CONROY:  This is a summary of the 34 business
4        records, and essentially it's to assist the jury in
5        associating the specific business records with counts.
6                 We have no problem with some kind of instruction
7        to the jury that the title is not in evidence, but these
8        are records that we're alleging are business records.
9                 THE COURT:  What is the purpose for introducing it
10        into evidence now?
11                 You can probably do it on summation.  You can do
12        it in summation.  I think it would be perfectly appropriate
13        at that time.
14                 MR. CONROY:  So could we -- I am just trying to
15        think how we can modify it.
16                 Can we call it "alleged false business records?"
17                 MR. BOVE:  There is a title.  It says, "The
18        Counts."  I think if you can keep the text on the top,
19        just redact the title on the bottom.  Just get the summary
20        in.
21                 THE COURT:  You have it.
22                 I think for summation you won't have an argument.
23        Okay?
24                 MR. CONROY:  Okay.

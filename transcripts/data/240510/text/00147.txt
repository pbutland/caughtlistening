J. Jarmel-Schneider - Recross/Bove
3235
1       Q    You just gave, essentially, what is a hypothesis about
2   these two calls on the screens; right?
3       A    I am just describing the timestamps on the calls.
4       Q    But, you're not accounting for what's on the right
5   side that says voicemail?
6       A    I don't think that's true.
7       I apologize. I don't think I'm not accounting for it.
8       I mean, the significance of the call is the timestamp.
9       Q    Well, that's part of the significance.
10       The other part is whether or not the phone call was
11   actually answered.
12       A    Not necessarily.
13       I'm not sure if the recording would have actually cut off
14   whether it was answered or not. Could have been it just came
15   in, cut off automatically. I don't know.
16       Q    Right.
17       You were here during Mr. Daus' testimony; correct?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    You were here when I asked him: You could not do any
20   forensic analysis to determine the interplay between an
21   incoming call and the voice recording data; right?
22                 MR. CONROY:  Objection.
23                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       Q    You are aware the recording cuts off, and that's why
25   you were looking for a toll like this?

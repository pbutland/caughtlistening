1                 COURT OFFICER:  All rise.
2                 (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors
3        are excused.)
4                 THE COURT:  Please be seated.
5                 Mr. Blanche, I was going to ask the People if I
6        could have a copy of People's 350. I think it would be
7        helpful to the Court in preparing the jury charges.
8                 I wanted to ask if there's any objection to my
9        receiving that now.
10                 MR. BLANCHE:  May I just have one moment?
11                 THE COURT:  Sure.
12                 (Whereupon, the Defense confers.)
13                 THE COURT:  Was that the number of the document
14        chart, 350?
15                 MR. CONROY:  Yes, Judge.
16                 (Whereupon, the Defense confers).
17                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, we're fine with that.
18                 THE COURT:  Okay.
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  On the same topic, our intention
20        was to submit it to the Court, as the Court might have
21        some proposed charges as well.
22                 There's certainly no objection to the Court
23        reviewing that.
24                 THE COURT:  Thank you. I appreciate that.
25                 That was going to be my next thing.

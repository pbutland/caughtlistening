1 declarant, who they shouldn’t be permitted to impeach in
2 the first place.
3 MR. CONROY: The last thing —— hopefully the last
4 thing, it’s not that it’s the reason, but it’s a reason,
5 and it’s a significant reason that helps explain why he’s
6 not here.
7 THE COURT: I think it would be helpful to me
8 making my decision if I could see that some efforts were
9 taken to compel his appearance.
10 I don’t have to do this right now; right?
11 MR. CONROY: No.
12 THE COURT: Let me think about it.
13 Right now, it seems to me that we’re kind of
14 trying to jump the gun.
15 We want to explain why he’s not here, without
16 having made every effort to get him here.
17 Section 3(C) —— actually, it’s 3(D), it says:
18 Except for acts or testimony directly compelled by
19 subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of
20 competent jurisdiction.
21 It seems to me, if I’m understanding correctly,
22 that that step has not yet been taken. Not that it has to
23 be taken.
24 It’s a factor for me in making this decision.
25 MR. STEINGLASS: Can I just say one thing on

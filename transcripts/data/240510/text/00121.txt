6   summaries that you created?
7       A.   Somewhat short one, but, yes.
8       Q.   But, basically, they all look the same; some may be

12   Weisselberg?

14       Q.   Do we see that on the top left of the chart?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   We saw some redactions.  What is redacted in these
17   charts?

19       Q.   What are the numbers next to Michael Cohen and the name
20   Allen Weisselberg?
21       A.   Michael Cohen has 0114 and Allen Weisselberg has 7224
22   and 4509.
23       Q.   Can you walk us through what this chart demonstrates?

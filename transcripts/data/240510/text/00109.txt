1   social media over the last couple of years?
2       A.   Yes.
3       Q.   And are you continuing to review it during this trial?
4       A.   Yes.
5       Q.   Did you review it, for example, this week or last
6   night?
7       A.   Not last night, but I think earlier in the week at some
8   point, yeah.
9       Q.   And as part of that review, not limiting it to
10   Ms. Daniels, but to all the parties that your reviewing, when
11   you observe something that you believe to be interesting, what's
12   the process that you use to alert that to your team?
13       A.   Well, I think it depends.  I think there are some
14   things that I just know for a fact we would want to have saved
15   to our case file.
16            There are other things I have a question about, I will
17   call one of the attorneys and ask them if they think I should
18   pull it or not.
19       Q.   Basically, not to -- but based upon the information you
20   provide them, the Prosecutors that you work with decide whether
21   to use it or not use it; correct?
22       A.   Basically, yeah.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  No further questions, your Honor.
24                 THE COURT:  Anything else?
25                 MS. MANGOLD:  No, your Honor.

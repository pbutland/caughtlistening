M. Westerhout - Cross/Necheles

1       some of the exhibits that the defense used on
2       cross-examination because they were responsive.
3                This is totally outside of the scope of the direct.
4       And this is exactly the problem that we identified at the
5       beginning of this trial, which is, that they hadn't
6       designated any exhibits, and that your Honor had precluded
7       any exhibits that -- directed, you know, case in chief
8       exhibits that were not designated by the following day.
9                They didn't designate any.
10                So -- and we specifically raised the spectre of the
11       defense trying to make our witnesses their own and back door
12       that preclusion by trying to put in nonresponsive exhibits,
13       which are really case in chief exhibits, under the guise
14       that this is cross-examination.
15                Now, this is fully beyond the scope of the direct
16       examination.
17                We didn't ask a single question about the
18       President's travel schedule or the President-Elect's travel
19       schedule.
20                And to top it all off, these travel schedule
21       exhibits are from October.
22                She testified she wasn't even there at Trump Tower
23       or working with the defendant until after Election Day.
24                So, this is -- this should be precluded, this
25       entire area.

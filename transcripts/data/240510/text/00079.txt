G. Longstreet - Direct/Mangold
3167
1       Q    Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity
2   to review files marked for identification as People's Exhibits
3   407-F, 407-G, 407-H and 407-I?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    Are they public posts from the Twitter handle
6   @realDonaldTrump.
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    Who retrieved and saved those posts?
9       A    I did.
10       Q    Did you save them in a particular way?
11       A    I did.
12       Q    And did you save them in the same way that you saved
13   the previous Twitter posts that we discussed last time?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Can you briefly remind the jury what that was?
16       A    Yes.  So, I just used the platform or the tool that we
17   have to screenshot, and I then screenshot the post, save it to
18   a folder that was relevant to the post and then hashed the
19   post.
20       Q    And hashing, again, is a way to uniquely identify each
21   post?
22       A    Yeah.
23       Q    Are these exhibits exact copies of the public posts
24   that you saved and hashed?
25       A    Yes.

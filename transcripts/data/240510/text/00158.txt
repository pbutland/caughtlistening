1        unnecessary for -- and it is being offered to impeach
2        Mr. Weisselberg.
3                 It's being offered to show a bias and a motive
4        that the Government's own hearsay declarant, they're
5        saying, has.
6                 It's a much more complicated situation than that.
7                 For those reasons, we don't think it's relevant.
8                 And if it is, it should not come in because of
9        the prejudice.
10                 MR. CONROY:  Very quickly, Judge, with respect to
11        Mr. McConney, I believe he's gotten all of his payments,
12        and his Agreement has sort of ended.
13                 The other thing I would say is, if Counsel
14        prefers, we would be willing to stipulate that
15        Mr. Weisselberg is in jail for perjury if that solves the
16        problem.
17                 THE COURT:  I think that that would be one way to
18        solve the problem.
19                 My question is, has anyone attempted to get him
20        to come in in some way, by serving him with a subpoena
21        or -- in other words, try to compel his testimony?
22                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, the People have not.
23                 THE COURT:  And have you?
24                 You have an obligation.
25                 MR. BOVE:  No.

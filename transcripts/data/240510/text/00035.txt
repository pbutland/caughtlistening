1       Q    The tape came out in October of 2016; right?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And you did not meet Mr. Trump until after the election
4   in November of 2016; right?
5       A    That's right.
6       Q    And you didn't spend any real time with him until
7   January 2017; right?
8       A    Not a significant amount of time, yes.
9       Q    So you have no firsthand knowledge about his reaction
10   to the Access Hollywood tape; right?
11       A    No firsthand knowledge, no.
12       Q    And you testified on cross-examination that while

14   proclamations, executive orders, memos and other documents;
15   right?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    And it is your testimony that Mr. Trump signed those
18   documents without reviewing them?
19       A    Not all of them.  But, he had people who did that for

21   by the time they got to his desk, it was ready for his
22   signature.
23       Q    And you testified on direct that you worked at a

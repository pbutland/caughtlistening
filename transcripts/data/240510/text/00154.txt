1 business records hearsay objection.
2 If your Honor overrules this right now, we’re
3 going to stipulate.
4 Our objection is to relevance and undue
5 prejudice.
6 We don’t think it’s relevant that he entered into
7 this Agreement after—the—fact.
8 And we think it's unduly prejudicial and
9 confusing in light of the fact that Mr. Weisselberg is in
10 prison right now and not available to anyone.
11 THE COURT: So, I understand the relevance of the
12 objection.
13 Help me understand the undue prejudice objection
14 a little bit more.
15 MR. BOVE: As a result of Mr. Weisselberg’s legal
16 situation, I think that he would, likely —— if either side
17 tried to call him, he would, likely, invoke.
18 We are not able to elicit testimony because of
19 those circumstances. We're not able to elicit testimony
20 that would, potentially, impeach some of the hearsay that
21 has been offered.
22 And I think the Government is probably in a
23 similar situation.
24 He is, in effect, their witness at this trial as
25 a hearsay declarant.

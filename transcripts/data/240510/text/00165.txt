1                 THE COURT:  Mr. Steinglass?
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Judge, we have repeatedly
3        instructed all of the witnesses in this case, to the
4        extent that we have any control over it, to refrain from
5        making public statements.
6                 The fact of the matter is, we have no control
7        over what they do. We have repeatedly, repeatedly asked
8        the witnesses not to do that. Not just Mr. Cohen. All the
9        witnesses.
10                 The fact of the matter is, these witnesses are
11        not subject to the Gag Order, and we have no remedy if
12        they engage in those activities.
13                 So, all we can do -- if the Court is -- if
14        Mr. Blanche is asking the Court to order the People to
15        order the witnesses not to do something, we have already
16        done that. Or, to the extent that we have already asked,
17        we have no power to order.
18                 And, there's nothing, really, more to say about
19        that.
20                 THE COURT:  It might be a little bit of a new
21        answer, but I would direct the People to communicate to
22        Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from
23        making any more statements about this case, about
24        Mr. Trump, or about anything related to this case or the
25        process; that that comes from the Bench and that you are

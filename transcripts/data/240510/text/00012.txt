M. Westerhout - Cross/Necheles
3100
1                THE COURT:  She didn't say that.
2                MS. NECHELES:  She will.  I haven't been able to
3       ask her questions about it yet.
4                THE COURT:  You are getting close?
5                MS. NECHELES:  Yes, I haven't been able to ask her
6       about this yet.
7                We weren't able to put it up on the screen.  I was
8       about to establish a business record foundation.
9                That's what I'm doing, what I was going to do right
10       now.
11                MR. STEINGLASS:  This is exactly the problem.
12                We did not ask a single question about scheduling
13       or the work that she did prior to the election.
14                Ms. Necheles asked about scheduling and meetings in
15       January.
16                But this door is not opened.  This is -- this is
17       vintage, and an end run around your Honor's ruling, and it
18       should not be countenanced.
19                MS. NECHELES:  Judge, I have to say also, these
20       documents are not like a surprise to the People.
21                They came to us in discovery.
22                It's not like I'm showing documents that they have
23       never seen before.
24                THE COURT:  But the issue is whether you intended
25       to put them in all along.

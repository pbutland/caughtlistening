2 A. I did.
3 Q. Can you describe how you did that?

7 Q. What kinds of documents are People’s 1 through 34?
8 A. They are invoices, vouchers from The Trump

10 Q. And does the information in the chart that we
11 designated People's Exhibit 350 for identification exactly
12 reflect information taken from People's Exhibit 1 through 34 in
13 evidence?
14 A. Yes.
15 MR. BOVE: I do have an objection. If we can go

22 Has it been modified?
23 MR. CONROY: No.

25 anticipating my objection.

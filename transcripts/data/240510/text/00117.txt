2 Q. What did you do with the Verizon records?
3 A. So the Verizon records were a particular year. They

5 into Excel, wrote simple scripts to extract the information that
6 was put into a format that was file readable. Then we just

8 Then formatted them.
9 Q. In addition to what's in evidence as People's 400 and
10 401, did you include any other records in the call summaries?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Do you recall what date?
13 A. In some cases we put calls that were taken off of the
14 call log that is in evidence as 261, which is calls pulled from
15 Mr. Cohen's phone.
16 Q. What was the purpose of creating these summaries?

18 somewhat hard to decipher. They don't list which caller is
19 associated with the phone number. They're all different time
20 zones.
21 And kind of, more importantly, they include a lot of
22 extraneous outside calls of people that are not relevant. We
23 wanted to create summaries that were a bit more digestible and
24 easy and by time zone.
25 Q. You mentioned different time zones; how did you

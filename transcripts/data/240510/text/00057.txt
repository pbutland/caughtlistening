D. Dixon — Cross/Bove
3145
1 Exhibit 400 that ends with Bates 1093, please.
2 Q And I just want to make sure that I understand the
3 Feature column, and so, we are going to go through a couple of
4 these, and I am going over to the table so I can see as well.
5 MR. BOVE: And so, let’s —— if we could zoom in
6 on the Feature column for item seven and eight on this
7 page.
8 Q And, Mr. Dixon, while we are doing that, are you
9 familiar with the codes in the Feature column?
10 A Yes.
11 Q And so, do you see where it says, NIOP?
12 A Yes.
13 Q And that’s Call Number Identity Presentation, right?
14 A Yes.
15 Q Basically an incoming call?
16 A Correct.
17 Q And then do you see where it says, CFNA?
18 A Yes.
19 Q Calling Number Identity Presentation, right?
20 A No. CFNA is Call Forwarding No Answer.
21 Q And then the next one is VM, Voice—mail?
22 A Yes.
23 Q So, am I understanding this right, that when I see
24 something like this in the Feature column, what I am looking at
25 is a call that is dialed and then it goes to voicemail, right?

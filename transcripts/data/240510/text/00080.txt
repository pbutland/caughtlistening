13 BY MS. MANGOLD:
14 Q Ms. Longstreet, is this a Twitter post?
15 A Yes.
16 Q And I think last time you explained some aspects of
17 the social media platform Twitter and how it operated in 2016?
18 A Yep.
19 Q In addition to those questions, can you explain what a
20 thread is?
21 A Yes. So, Twitter has a character limit which only
22 allows you to put a certain amount of characters for one tweet.
23 So, a way that some users are able to get around the character
24 limit is by posting multiple tweets in the same thread so they
25 are kind of connected to each other in a sense.

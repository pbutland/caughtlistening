1                 In that way, we don't think the Government is
2        able to impeach their own hearsay declarant, even in this
3        form of impeachment, that he entered into a Settlement
4        Agreement after-the-fact, based on a host of situations
5        that we don't think is relevant at this trial.
6                 We think those two considerations require that
7        this not come in because of the confusion it would add.
8                 THE COURT:  Thanks.
9                 People?
10                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, as the Court is aware, there
11        has been -- there probably will be more discussion of
12        Mr. Weisselberg and various things related to him in the
13        case.
14                 And what we are looking to do is explain, from
15        our perspective, why he's not here.
16                 I am sure there will be arguments made by Counsel
17        about whether he should have been here and what not being
18        here means.
19                 I think we need this Agreement.
20                 Our view is that Mr. Weisselberg's interests
21        right now are very aligned with the Defendant's. I think
22        this Agreement points that out.
23                 Among other things, there are three payments due
24        Mr. Weisselberg during this calendar year for $250,000
25        each; one in June, one in September, and one in December.

2   BY MS. NECHELES:
3       Q    Good morning.
4       A    Good morning.
5       Q    We spoke a little yesterday about the travel schedule.
6   Do you recall that -- or I'm sorry, withdrawn.
7       We spoke a little bit yesterday about the campaign?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And you were working on the RNC Hearing; right?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    What is the RNC?
12       A    The Republican National Committee.
13       Q    And there came a point where President Trump won the
14   Republican nomination; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And after that, am I correct, that the RNC and the
17   campaign worked extremely closely together?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Because at that point, President Trump is the
20   presumptive Republic -- is the Republican nominee, and the
21   RNC wants, just like the campaign wants, to get him nominated;
22   right?
23       A    Absolutely.  Yes.
24       Q    So you guys were basically one unit; right?
25       A    That's right.

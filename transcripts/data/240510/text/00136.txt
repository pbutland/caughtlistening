1   Rodriguez; right?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    That's another exhibit where, this week, a significant
4   number of calls were removed; right?
5       A    I don't know about "significant", but they were
6   shortened.
7       Q    Three pages worth?
8       A    I don't know off the top of my head.
9                 MR. BOVE:  Mr. Conroy, do you have a copy of 344?
10                 MR. CONROY:  I need the Bates number.
11                 Who is it between?

13                 MR. BOVE:  4269.
14       Q    Just to try to move along, you remember deleting
15   several pages from 344; correct?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    Now, you also testified about some call summaries
18   relating to Michael Cohen; correct?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    And one of the phone numbers that you looked at with
21   respect to Michael Cohen ended in 0144; right?
22       A    0114.
23       Q    That's the attention to detail I was talking about.
24       Thank you.
25       So, that's a number that you had to get familiar with

2 Q. What information did you rely on in making that
3 report?
4 A. So I looked at the subscriber records that I mentioned
5 from AT&T and Verizon. I also looked at other pieces of
6 documentary records; text messages, records, email signatures,
7 contact lists produced by The Trump Organization. I also looked
8 at the contact lists that were extracted from Mr. Cohen's cell
9 phones.
10 Q. What was the purpose of creating this report?
11 A. We wanted to give the jury a sense of how we figured
12 out which phone numbers were associated with which people. Kind
13 of where the phone numbers would show up in the evidence that we
14 ultimately used.
15 Q. Are the records that you relied on in making this chart
16 all in evidence in this case?
17 A. Yes.
18 MR. CONROY: If we can pull up for the Court and
19 parties and the witness, but not the jury, what's been

21 Q. Do you recognize what that is?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. What is it?
24 A. This is the phone key I was just talking about.
25 Q. You created this?

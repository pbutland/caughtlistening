1 finance laws since 1907, so close to 90 years before
2 Mr. Trump made the admission in that video.
3 And to the extent that defense counsel argues
4 that the clip predates the relevant time period, that’s an

6 THE COURT: Do you have any other argument?
7 MR. BOVE: No. That’s our position, Judge.
8 THE COURT: All right.
9 I will rule after the break.
10 (Short recess is taken.)
11 SERGEANT: Remain seated. Come to Order.
12 Part 59 is back in session.
13 THE COURT: All right.
14 Two things regarding the People’s application, I
15 understand what you are saying, that the laws did not
16 change between 1999 and 2017. I still feel that that’s
17 pretty attenuated.
18 Plus, you are asking the jurors to draw an
19 inference that because he knew the laws in 1999, he still
20 knew them in 2015 and 2017. I think that's a lot of
21 speculation.
22 I am going to side with the Defense and preclude
23 you from introducing that.
24 Regarding scheduling today, we have two more
25 witnesses, right, today?

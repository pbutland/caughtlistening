1 All of the calls on those charts are in evidence in other
2 places; is that right?
3 A Yes.
4 Q Does that include the calls that Mr. Bove was talking
5 about that when we cut down on the charts, those calls are all
6 still in evidence; correct?
7 A Yes.
8 Q Why, if you know —— if you know, why were those
9 exhibits shortened?
10 A My understanding is that the decision was always going
11 to be that we would admit the parts of the call summaries that
12 were related to what had come out in trial. That’s the point of
13 doing summary charts.
14 We’re pretty far down the road now, so we made decisions
15 about which parts of them to include.
16 Q And you were asked a couple of questions about the
17 fact that you knew that the charts —— the original summary
18 charts had been turned over to the Defense; is that right?
19 A Yes.
20 Q And you know that the new versions had also been
21 turned over to the Defense; right?
22 A That’s correct.
23 Q And were you aware that there was no objection to
24 those charts coming into evidence?
25 A Yes.

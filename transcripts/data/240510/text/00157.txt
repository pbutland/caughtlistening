I What we’re trying to do is explain his absence.
2 I think, or I would submit, that this Agreement
3 offers a real explanation for why he is not going to be
4 here in this trial.
5 MR. BOVE: We just, respectfully, disagree with
6 that.
7 This Agreement is not the reason that
8 Mr. Weisselberg is not at this trial.
9 Jeff McConney has a substantial similar Agreement
10 that is in evidence, but he testified at this trial. And
ll his availability or lack thereof is much more
12 straight—forward, has similar terms.
13 Nobody tried to invoke that Agreement to prevent
l4 him from testifying.
15 That’s just not the case. That's not the reason
16 Mr. Weisselberg is not here.
17 The reason Mr. Weisselberg is not a witness to
18 either side is because the District Attorney’s Office
19 initiated a perjury prosecution in the lead—up to this
20 case.
21 Even that sentence, I know, is a very complicated
22 sentence, Judge.
23 My point is, to get into any of this, it would
24 all have to come out.
25 It’s just a rabbit hole that I think is

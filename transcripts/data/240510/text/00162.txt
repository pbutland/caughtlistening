1 he’s either unavailable or unwilling to testify.
2 MR. STEINGLASS: We could do that, Judge, but
3 then we would still be under the situation of calling the
4 witness to the stand who's under no obligation with us.
5 THE COURT: Right .
6 Then it would be on the record and I’ve seen it.
7 MR . STEINGLASS: Right .
8 THE COURT: Right now, we’re speculating. We're
9 speculating he would honor an Agreement. We’re
10 speculating the degree to which this Agreement dictates he
11 could not speak to you. We’re speculating to the advice he
12 may or may not be given by counsel.
13 It’s difficult to rule like that.
14 MR. BOVE: I want to make one last point, because
15 we’re contemplating a lot of process around this.
16 Mr. Weisselberg has never been on the
17 Government’s witness list.
18 So, to suddenly try and create this procedure to
19 get around a way to admit this document —— I think we were
20 procedurally barred this morning from offering an exhibit.
21 I think there are procedural problems with trying
22 to add him to the witness list at this point, as well.
23 THE COURT: I don’t see what one thing has to do
24 with the other.
25 We’re not creating any procedure.

J. Tomalin - Cross/Bove
3154
1            Air Time Charges, Long Distance/Other Charges and
2   Total, those three columns identify any financial charges
3   assessed to that call respectively.
4       Q    Just a couple of quick questions.
5            In the MIN column, is that minutes?
6       A    Yes, it is.
7       Q    And how does that work?
8            Does it reflect seconds, or does Verizon round in a
9   standard direction?
10       A    On the bill we round up.
11       Q    And with respect to the time shown for each of those
12   calls, what timezone does Verizon keep its records in?
13       A    They -- the timezone should be the timezone for the
14   City and State reflected in the origination column.
15       Q    So, when we look at the date and time columns,
16   together with the origination column, that should tell us the
17   timezone that that call is being reflected in?
18       A    Yes.
19                 MR. CONROY:  Thank you.
20                 I have no further questions.
21                 THE COURT:  You may inquire.
22                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you, Judge.

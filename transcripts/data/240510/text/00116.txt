8 that is listed next to them.
9 MR. CONROY: Okay. We can take that down.
10 Q. I now want to talk about another part of the work that
11 you did with the phone records here. Did you create a number of
12 summaries of phone records?

15 A. These are just logs of phone calls between pairs of
16 people.
17 Q. You mentioned that you received the records that we
18 just discussed earlier in a number of file formats, particularly
19 the records now in People's 400 and 401 from AT&T and Verizon.
20 Starting with the AT&T records, how did you go about
21 putting data in the summary?
22 A. We have a software that reads through the text files,
23 the AT&T files. It allows us to file and sort by phone number,
24 date, caller, et cetera.
25 We uploaded the text files, filtered and sorted and

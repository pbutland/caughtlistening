G. Longstreet - Direct/Mangold
3162
1       of the day.
2                 I am told that we only have two more witnesses
3       that are relatively short.  Today's plan is we are going to
4       work until about one o'clock or whatever time we get done
5       so you don't have to come back in the afternoon.
6                 Let's call the next witness, please.
7                 MS. MANGOLD:  The People recall Georgia
8       Longstreet.
9                      (Whereupon, the witness resumed the stand.)
10                 THE COURT:  Ms. Longstreet, you are still under
11       oath.
12                 You may inquire.
13                 MS. MANGOLD:  Thank you, your Honor.
14   G E O R G I A    L O N G S T R E E T,
15   called as a witness, being previously sworn, was examined and
16   testified further as follows:
17       Q    Welcome back, Ms. Longstreet.
18            Can you remind everyone where you work and what your
19   position is?
20       A    Yes.  I work for the New York County District
21   Attorney's Office, and I am a paralegal.
22       Q    The last time you were here, I believe you testified
23   that your duties and responsibilities include locating and
24   saving social media posts relevant to the case?
25       A    Yep.

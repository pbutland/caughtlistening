3146
1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And in the AT&T records, each account has a separate
3   phone number for voicemail, right?
4       A    Not each account, but each voicemail magistrate.  So,
5   there is another number entailed with voicemail.
6       Q    Was it voicemail magistrate that you said?
7       A    Voicemail box.
8       Q    And so, that an incoming call to the number associated
9   with this account, again, gets forwarded to that voice-mail
10   inbox, right?
11       A    Yes.
12                 MR. BOVE:  Now, if we can stay on these two rows,
13       items seven and eight, and if you can zoom in on
14       Originating Number and Terminating Number.
15       Q    And so, you see here there is a D in parentheses?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    That stands for dialed, right?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    And so, there is an originating number that dialed
20   that 0114 number, right?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And then where you see the F in parentheses --
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    -- that is the number getting forwarded to the
25   voicemail inbox, correct?

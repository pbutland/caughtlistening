M. Westerhout - Cross/Necheles
3104
1                (At Sidebar.)
2       ******
3                THE COURT:  So the People called this witness;
4       right?
5                I don't know how they got them this morning?  How
6       did they get them this morning?
7                MS. NECHELES:  I sent them this morning.  I called
8       them and then I sent it this morning.
9                THE COURT:  Because you intended to present it to
10       the witness?
11                MS. NECHELES:  It just happened that I thought of
12       it last night.
13                MR. STEINGLASS:  And we didn't even get notice of
14       this until the witness was on the stand in the middle of
15       questions.
16                I mean, this is just sandbagging.
17                MS. NECHELES:  Judge, I just sent them this morning
18       and then maybe ten minutes before I walked in here that I
19       was able to talk to them.
20                She did recognize many them.  She said it.
21                This is really a very last minute thing.
22                THE COURT:  But you were trying to lay a
23       foundation.
24                You already knew that she didn't see this, and you
25       already knew her answer.

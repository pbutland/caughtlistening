1        that, Judge?
2                 THE COURT:  Sure.
3                 MR. STEINGLASS:  While it's true that we could
4        subpoena him and put him up there cold, the Agreement
5        seems to preclude us from talking to him or him talking to
6        us at the risk of losing $750,000 of outstanding severance
7        pay.
8                 So, while it is, theoretically, our prerogative
9        to try to subpoena him, put him up, and see if he would
10        take the Fifth Amendment in real-time, but do this cold,
11        is a -- I don't think is really the entire point. Even if
12        it's -- even if it's relevant, I don't think it's the
13        entire point.
14                 I think that that Agreement has a very palpable
15        connection to why that could be an exercise in futility or
16        a strategically bad decision, to put a witness on the
17        stand who is under an Agreement like that.
18                 THE COURT:  Right.
19                 I think one way to possibly deal with that is to
20        do it out of the presence of the jury and put him on the
21        stand.
22                 He can have counsel present.
23                 He can be asked a few questions, and he can say,
24        "I'm not going to answer the questions," and then we can
25        go through the steps that are required for me to find that

8                 THE COURT:  So, are we okay working until one
9       o'clock, or maybe a little bit longer than one o'clock, so
10       we will end in the morning and not come back in the

15       matter about an exhibit that we can take up after the
16       witnesses are done.
17                 I don't think it will take long.

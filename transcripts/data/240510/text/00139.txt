J. Jarmel-Schneider - Cross/Bove
3227
1       Q    At this trial, you're sort of the guardian of the toll
2   records; right?
3       A    I don't know if I'd say that, but if you say so.
4       Q    There are no toll records in evidence that reflect
5   calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker around this time
6   period; are there?
7       A    I don't think that's true, but I would have to look at
8   the underlying records.
9       Q    Do you know what they're marked?
10       A    It would be in either People's 400 or 401.
11       Hope Hicks wasn't a part of the Verizon records, so it
12   would be in 401.
13       Q    And there's no call summary chart between the phone
14   calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker; is that correct?
15       A    That's correct.
16       Q    The last thing I want to talk about the Government
17   Exhibit 247, which is in evidence.
18                 MR. BOVE:  If you could bring that up, please.
19                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20                 MR. BOVE:  Zoom in as best we can.
21       Q    So, this is that recording file off the physical
22   device marked CP1; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And you said based on the file name -- there's that
25   timestamp, time field, that it is dated September 6, 2016?

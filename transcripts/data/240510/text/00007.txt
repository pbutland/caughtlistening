1   recall that?
2       A    Uh-huh, yes.
3       Q    What you meant by that was, it wasn't unusual for him
4   to send them to everybody, newspaper clippings; right?
5       A    That's right.
6       Q    But with respect to sending them to Allen Weisselberg,
7   do you recall what happened other times?
8       A    Not that I can recall, no.
9       Q    This might have been the only time that he was
10   President that he sent something like this to Allen Weisselberg;
11   right?
12       A    It could have been, yes.
13       Q    And you were asked if Allen Weisselberg -- you spoke to
14   Allen Weisselberg during when he was President; do you recall
15   that, about checks?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    And, am I correct, that you do not have any specific
18   recollection of Allen Weisselberg and the President -- and
19   President Trump speaking during the first year that President
20   Trump was in office?
21       A    That's correct, yes.
22       Q    And you have a vague recollection that at some point
23   they might have spoken about a check?
24       A    Yes, vaguely, uh-huh.
25       Q    But you're not even sure that that's true; right?

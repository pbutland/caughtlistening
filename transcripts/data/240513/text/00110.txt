1       A    Quite a few.
2       Q    And were those conversations on the phone, in person
3   or both?
4       A    Both.
5       Q    And, in total, approximately, how many conversations
6   do you think you had with AMI, with David Pecker and Dylan
7   Howard, about the Karen McDougal deal?
8       A    Also a substantial amount.
9       Q    By the way, did you ever play for Mr. Pecker the
10   recorded conversation that you had with Mr. Trump where he said
11   he understood that he would have to pay the $150,000?
12       A    No.
13       Q    Why not?
14       A    He didn't ask me to.  I had told him that I had spoken
15   to Mr. Trump and that he is going to do it.  I told him I
16   could, but I just never played it.
17       Q    In other words -- withdrawn.
18            After the conversation you had with Mr. Trump, that
19   you taped on September 6th of 2016, did you move promptly ahead
20   the next day with Daniel Rotstein to finalize the agreements
21   then?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    Was there any need to play that recording for
24   Mr. Pecker?
25       A    No.

9 pre—2016.
10 But, in general, explain how you communicated with him.

13 ways.
14 Q Understood.
15 Did you have all of his cell phone and other telephone
16 numbers in your contacts in your phone at the time?
17 A I did.
18 Q And you used all those variety of numbers as a way to
19 contact him?
20 A Yes.
21 Q When he called you, did he, generally, call you on
22 your cell phone or your work phone at The Trump Organization?
23 A Well, it was a combination of both.
24 Most of the time, it would be on my cell phone. Unless it
25 was in the office, he would have one of his assistants ring me

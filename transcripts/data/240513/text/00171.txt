1 it for Mr. Trump before. I figured why not ask.
2 Q. What did he say?
3 A. Not a chance.
4 Q. Did he say why?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. What did he say?
7 A. I knew he didn't get the money back on the $150,000

9 me my job.
10 Q. How did you leave things with Dylan Howard and David
11 Pecker on that call, what did you tell them?
12 A. Make sure it's locked down. We're going to take care
13 of it.
14 Q. In other words, who did you say was going to take care
15 of it at that point?
16 A. I was.
17 Q. Thank you.
18 Now, you said earlier, I believe, that you sometimes
19 communicated with David Pecker by Signal, an encrypted
20 application?
21 A. Yes, ma'am.
22 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's put up just for the witness
23 and counsel and the Judge People's 212 for identification,
24 please.
25 Q. Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

1 Q. Do you believe you received some that night as well?
2 A. I do.
3 Q. Did you try to emphasize those talking points as well?
4 A. Yes, ma'am.
5 Q. What, if any, additional pressure did you feel to close
6 this deal with Stormy Daniels as a result?

8 anxious to sell the story.
9 Q. Did there come a time after that, again, still in
10 October of 2016, that Mr. Trump, in substance, expressed to you
11 that he understood he could no longer delay this transaction?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And describe that conversation that you had with him?
14 A. He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends,
15 some individuals, very smart people, and that: It's $130,000.
16 You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to
17 keep this thing out there. So do it.
18 And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with
19 Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out.
20 Q. Following that conversation with Mr. Trump, did you, in
21 fact, have some discussions with Allen Weisselberg about trying
22 to figure out how the payment would be made?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And what, in substance, did you discuss with

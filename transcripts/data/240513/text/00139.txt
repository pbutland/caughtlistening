1   she would owe at that point in time the LLC that was going to do
2   it, she would owe them 1-million-dollars per violation.
3       Q.   Whose idea was it to have that million-dollar, as you
4   say, punitive damage provision in the contract?
5       A.   It was mine.
6       Q.   What was the point of that?
7       A.   To ensure that she didn't speak.  Not only that, there
8   was also a provision in there that she disclose who she had told
9   the story to, and they were included in the Agreement.
10       Q.   There was a list of names that were included in the
11   Agreement?
12       A.   Yes, ma'am.
13       Q.   Now, the email mentions a Side Letter Agreement.  That
14   is also one of the attachments here.
15           What was the purpose of the Side Letter Agreement that
16   is referenced here?
17       A.   The Side Letter Agreement would be a one-page document
18   that indicates pseudonym names that we were going to use in the
19   Non-Disclosure Agreement.  And the purpose of that is if
20   somehow the Non-Disclosure Agreement got out, having the names
21   Peggy Peterson or David Dennison would have no meaning to
22   anyone.
23       Q.   And so, would the Side Letter Agreement be a key to who
24   those names are really related to?
25       A.   Yes.

1       Q    Over the years you've seen his handwriting and you've
2   watched him write on this document?
3       A    Yes, ma'am.
4       Q    Now, tell us what Allen Weisselberg told you at the
5   meeting, including what he told you to write on that document?
6       A    So for Tech Services that were done.  And it's
7   regarding a different type of a matter, one that I had gone to
8   Mr. Trump with on a regular basis in order to -- it was to
9   purchase IP addresses and things like that.  The total that was
10   due to Red Finch was $50,000.  But that was actually done, like,
11   two years earlier.
12       Q    So did Mr. -- what, if anything, did Mr. Weisselberg
13   tell you about what to put down about those monies that were
14   owed to Red Finch from two years earlier?
15       A    Include everything as -- obviously, I was no longer
16   going to have a position at The Trump Organization, there was no
17   way for me to get that money back or to have this matter done --
18       Q    What, if anything, did he tell you to do in terms of
19   totaling the monies owed to Red Finch and the monies that you
20   had paid out to Stormy Daniels to Keith Davidson?
21       A    So the 130,000 was obviously the money that went for
22   the Non-Disclosure Agreement.
23       He told me to add up the 130 with the 50,000 for Red Finch.
24   Total it to 180,000.  Thirty-five was lost, that was just a wire
25   transfer fee.

1   with Dylan Howard right after he met with Karen McDougal?
2       A    Yes, ma'am.
3       Q    And why did you do that?
4       A    Because I needed to get an update so I could provide it
5   to Mr. Trump.
6       Q    And shortly after these updates from Mr. Howard, did
7   you actually have a call with both Dylan Howard and David Pecker
8   to find out about their interview with Karen McDougal?
9       A    Yes, ma'am.
10       Q    And what was the substance of what they told you during
11   that three-person call about progress with Karen McDougal?
12       A    That they believed that they have this under control,
13   as Dylan had stated to me:  "I will get this locked down for
14   you.  And I won't let it out of my grasp."
15       Q    Did Dylan Howard tell you what his opinion was about
16   whether he believed that Karen McDougal had had a relationship
17   with Mr. Trump?
18                MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
19                THE COURT:  Sustained.
20       Q    Was it important for you to have that call with Dylan
21   Howard and David Pecker?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    And that's to make sure that things were being taken
24   care of for Mr. Trump?
25       A    Yes.

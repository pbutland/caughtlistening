1       Q    And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump how
2   much you were going to be paid in total?
3       A    It was going to be divided by 12, and it's $35,000 a
4   month, and that they would actually start making the payments
5   in February, not January, because there was a lot going on with
6   Mr. Trump moving to D.C., the Inauguration, and so on.
7       Q    And did Mr. Weisselberg reflect those payments over
8   12 months on that bank statement, People's 35?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And can you just read what that says there in the
11   middle or the bottom?
12       A    It says 420,000 divided by 12, that's an equal sign.
13   And that's 35,000.  And that's per month.
14       Q    And so was it stated -- did Mr. Weisselberg state in
15   front of Mr. Trump that you were going to receive $420,000 over
16   the course of 12 months?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at that time?
19       A    He approved it.  And he also said:  "This is going to
20   be one heck of a ride in D.C."
21       Q    And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump that
22   those monthly payments would be, you know, like a retainer for
23   legal services?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    Now, you mentioned something before, but I just wanted
                           Lisa Kramsky,

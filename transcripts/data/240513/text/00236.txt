1       A    Being President-Elect.
2       Q    Was he at meetings at Trump Tower?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    Now, what happened when you went into Mr. Trump's
5   office to have this discussion with him?
6       A    During the conversation, Allen turned around and said
7   to me, ummm, while we were talking about this, it was -- and
8   what we're going to do is, we're going to pay you over
9   12 months.
10       It was probably better if I get it in one lump sum.
11       No, no, no, no.  Why don't you do it as over 12 months and
12   it will be, ummm, paid out to you monthly.
13       Q    And did he say anything about how it would be paid out
14   as something?
15       A    Yeah, as like a legal service rendered since I was then
16   being given the title as Personal Attorney to the President.
17       Q    And we will get to that in a second.
18       So was this conversation that you had with Mr. Weisselberg
19   in Mr. Trump's office with Mr. Trump?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    And did Mr. Weisselberg have with him this document,
22   People's 35?
23       A    He did.
24       Q    And did he show this document to Mr. Trump?
25       A    Yes.

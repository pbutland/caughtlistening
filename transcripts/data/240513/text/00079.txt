2       Q    And is that transcript a true and accurate
3   representation of that portion of the conversation regarding the
4   purchase of materials from AMI?
5       A    Yes, there was one change that was made to one word.
6       Q    Okay.  And is what is currently the transcript that you
7   reviewed --
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    -- that you reviewed carefully against the tape, is it
10   true and accurate in terms of the words that are spoken by both
11   yourself and Mr. Trump?
12       A    Yes, ma'am.

19       Q    Now, Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, the first two minutes
20   or so of the conversation were not related to the Karen McDougal
21   matter; is that right?
22       A    That's correct.
23       Q    That's when Mr. Trump was on the phone and when you
24   were talking to him about some other divorce papers and
25   Charleston; is that right?

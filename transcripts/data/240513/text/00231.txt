1   were owed?
2       A    No.
3       Q    And, briefly, without describing details, why did he
4   tell you that he didn't want to pay them?
5       A    Because he didn't feel that he had gotten the benefit
6   of what he wanted, which dealt with the ranking.
7       Q    Now, did you end up paying out some money yourself to
8   Red Finch?
9       A    I did.
10       Q    How did that come about?
11       A    So I happened to know the CEO of Red Finch, and he
12   explained to me that:  This isn't fair, I'm out money, I had to
13   acquire -- lay out money for the IP addresses that we were
14   obtaining and requesting. And each time that I needed to go back
15   for more, I would go to Mr. Trump's office asking and requesting
16   that he give me the permission.
17       And so, I said to him, let me -- I said, I'll -- I'll take
18   care of it -- I'll take care of you.
19       I needed him for other things that I was working on for
20   Mr. Trump's benefit.
21       And so I went to my bank and I took out money to give him
22   because he told me he was going to be coming into New York from
23   Virginia.
24       Q    And did you pay him the full $50,000?  That was the
25   bill?

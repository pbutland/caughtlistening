1 Q At times, did you also speak with Mr. Pecker using an
2 encrypted application called Signal?
3 A Yes.
4 Q Why did you do that?
5 A Well, depending upon the matter, sometimes we thought
6 that encryption, not having the event traceable would be
7 beneficial.
8 Q Was it because it was something you wanted to keep
9 confidential and didn’t want anybody to be able to trace it or
10 look into those communications?
11 A Yes, ma’am.
12 Q And did you also, at times, communicate with
13 Mr. Pecker by email?
14 A Yes.
15 Q And you had his email address, as well, in your
16 contacts; is that right?
17 A Yes, ma’am.
18 Q Now, did you speak with Mr. Pecker at The Trump
19 Organization about matters having to do with Mr. Trump prior to
20 June of 2015?
21 A Yes, but rarely.
22 Q And was it —— what sort of matters were the few
23 matters that you spoke to him about, if you can remember, prior
24 to 2015?
25 A There was some things that had come up.

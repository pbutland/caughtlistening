1                 Can we now put up People's Exhibit 162, which is
2       in evidence?
3                      (Displayed.)
4       Q    Do you recognize that document, sir?
5       A    I do.
6       Q    What is that?
7       A    This is an executed Assignment of Licensing Agreement
8   between AMI as the signer to Resolution Consultants LLC dated
9   September 30th of 2016, and executed by David Pecker and
10   myself.
11       Q    And that's your signature there?
12       A    It is.
13       Q    And do you recognize David Pecker's signature?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Can you just describe for the jury, generally, what
16   were the terms of this Assignment Agreement?
17       A    As it states in the document:
18            For good and valuable consideration, the signer does
19   hereby sign and transfer to the assignee, successors and
20   assigns all of his rights, benefits and obligations to the
21   license agreement.
22       Q    Just, in general, without reading it for the jury,
23   there is a lot of legal language in there, does it represent
24   the transfer of those rights from AMI to Resolution
25   Consultants?

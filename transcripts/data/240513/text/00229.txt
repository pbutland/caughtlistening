1       Then he told me what he was going to do was to, it's called
2   "Gross it up," because I was taking it -- because I was taking
3   it as income.
4       And in order to get back the 180, you need to actually
5   double it because of tax purposes, being I was in the 50 percent
6   tax bracket, City, State and Federal.
7       So, in order to get back the 180, what he did was, he then
8   wrote down 360,000.
9       Q    Did he tell you that he wanted to gross up that number
10   of 180,000 to 360,000?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And what was your understanding about why he said he
13   needed to gross it up to 360,000?
14       A    Because otherwise you wouldn't get back your 180.  It
15   would be, obviously, less.
16       If they gave me the 180, and they didn't gross it up, after
17   taxes onto it, it would be 90.  Then, that's, again, assuming
18   that you take it as income as opposed to just a wash.
19       Q    Let me back up just for a second.
20       Were you previously -- you were familiar with paying
21   expenses for something, in other words, The Trump Organization,
22   did you ever pay out any expenses for a business trip or
23   something like that?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And when you submitted it to The Trump Organization, if

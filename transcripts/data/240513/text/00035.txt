1       Q    Were those, if you recall, covered in the news?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Did he, ultimately, decide to run for the Presidency
4   in 2011?
5       A    No.
6       Q    What was your understanding why he decided not to run?
7       A    There were several large real estate projects he
8   acquired, as well as another season of The Apprentice.
9       And, as Mr. Trump told me, "You don't leave Hollywood.
10   Hollywood leaves you."
11       Q    So, he decided to stay and do that work instead?
12       A    Yes, ma'am.
13       Q    Did there come a time, then, in June of 2015, when
14   Mr. Trump announced that he was running for President?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And how did he make that announcement, if you recall?
17       A    I do.
18       It was at The Atrium at Trump Tower. He came down the
19   stairs to the lowest level. And we had set up a podium. He made
20   the announcement and a speech.
21       Q    Now, at the time, in June of 2015, were you -- or any
22   time -- an official paid member of Mr. Trump's campaign?
23       A    No.
24       Q    Nevertheless, did you assist Mr. Trump in his
25   campaign?

1       A.   Well, that I had the opening of the company all set up.
2   Now it just needed to be funded.
3            To which Weisselberg turned and said:  Can we get AMI
4   to pay it?
5            I said:  No.  They've already expressed to me they're
6   not paying it.  They said we need to come up with a way how to
7   fund it.
8            I said:  We need to do it immediately.
9       Q.   What options did Mr. Weisselberg discuss with you?
10       A.   One option was to see whether I knew anybody who
11   wanted to purchase a golf membership at one of the various golf
12   courses or possibly somebody who was having a family affair,
13   like a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, that would be interested in
14   paying the money there and taking it as credit off of their
15   invoice, or maybe even just running it through one of the golf
16   courses.
17       Q.   Was he suggesting it would be a vehicle to use that
18   money to pay this?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   And what, if anything, did you discuss about those
21   options?
22       A.   Obviously, that wasn't a possibility because each of
23   those entities has a Trump name attached to it, and the whole
24   purpose was to ensure that Trump name in no way was disclosed in
25   this Non-Disclosure Agreement.

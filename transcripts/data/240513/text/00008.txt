5   liked the way that that occurred, and then continued to ask me

7   matters that he had.
8       Q    And did you perform some additional legal work for him
9   at that time?
10       A    I did.
11       Q    What --
12       A    Some legal. Some non-legal matters.
13       Q    Did he pay you for that work?
14       A    No, ma'am.
15       Q    Did there come a time where you -- this was when you

17       A    Yes.
18       Q    Did there come a time when you presented him with a
19   bill in connection with some work you had done in connection
20   with one of his properties?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Tell us a little bit about that.
23       A    I was asked to review a series of documents that dealt

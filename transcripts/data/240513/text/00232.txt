1       A    No, ma'am.
2       Q    And given that you didn't pay him the whole $50,000,
3   why did you put down $50,000 on there?
4       A    Well, for the previous year and a half I had told
5   Allen:  Look, I laid it out.  My hope was to get it, the money
6   from Allen onto it, so that I can give it to him.
7       But it never happened, but I constantly reminded him because
8   I did want him, you know, to receive the funds.
9       Q    Did you pay Red Finch less than $50,000?
10       A    I did.
11       Q    Okay.  And why did you then ask for $50,000 back?
12       A    Because that's what was owed and I didn't feel
13   Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the difference.
14       Q    And if you were going to get $50,000, but you paid out
15   less than 50,000, were you going to keep the rest of it for
16   yourself?
17       A    That's what I ended up doing.
18       Q    And just to go back to one thing.
19       Did Allen Weisselberg -- was Allen Weisselberg able to
20   approve the repayment to Red Finch for $50,000 without
21   Mr. Trump's approval?
22       A    No.
23       Q    Now, was there another piece to this repayment to you?
24   I think where we left off, you said that Mr. Weisselberg said
25   you needed to gross up the 180,000 to 360,000 to make it look

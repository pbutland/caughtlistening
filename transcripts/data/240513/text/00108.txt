13 cover on Men’s Health magazine had sold more copies than they
14 had not only anticipated, I think that they had ever —— the way
15 David expressed it to me, that they had ever sold, and they had
16 made a lot of money on that. And that it was no longer

23 Q Did he tell you what to do with that Assignment of
24 Rights Agreement that you had signed?
25 A He did.

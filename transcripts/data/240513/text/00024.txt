9 during those years?
10 A It was fantastic. It was —— working for him,
11 especially, during those ten years was —— (pause) —— an amazing
12 experience in many, many ways. There were great times. There
13 were several less than great times. But, for the most part, I
14 enjoyed the responsibilities that were given to me. I enjoyed
15 working with my colleagues at The Trump Organization, the Trump
16 children. It was a big family.

24 obligation towards him, as well?
25 A Yes.

2 Mr. Trump, the purchase of that information?
3 A For privacy purposes and for the benefit of Mr. Trump.
4 Hmmm.
5 Q Now, you didn't refer to Mr. Pecker by his full name;
6 you just said "David."
7 Why didn't you use his full name?
8 And was this sort of typical for this conversation?
9 A It wasn't necessary. Mr. Trump knew who I was
10 referring to.
11 It was an ongoing conversation that we had been having.

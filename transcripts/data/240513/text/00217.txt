1       Q    There are quite a few texts on there.
2       Can you summarize to the jury what's comprised in this
3   text?
4       A    Sure.
5       So, my daughter and I are very close. We're very much
6   connected.
7       And she was concerned that I was upset that I was not being
8   considered for the role.
9       I explained that Reince Priebus was pushing like a madman
10   early on. But I explained to her that there are so many
11   opportunities.
12       "Like what?"
13       I said: "When they come closer, I'll tell you all of them."
14       At the time, when I was communicating with my daughter, she
15   was at college at the University of Pennsylvania. And I didn't
16   want to get into the ideas that were going on because they were
17   still in a formulation state.
18       And so, she asks me: "Are the opportunities in government
19   or no?"
20       And I explained to her: "It's a hybrid."
21       And what I was referring to as "a hybrid" is meaning as
22   Personal Attorney to the President, I would continue to have my
23   continued access to President Trump, and I would still be able
24   to monetize my relationship and my ability with these various
25   different companies.

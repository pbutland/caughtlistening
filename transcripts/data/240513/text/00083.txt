11       Q    Now, what was the significance of "all that stuff" that
12   was mentioned?
13       A    "All that stuff" is referencing the information that
14   David Pecker had accumulated over the years of Mr. Trump that
15   was in that alleged locked door -- or drawer.
16       Q    And including also the Karen McDougal story?
17       A    And including Karen McDougal.
18       Q    Now, what was the conversation about "someone may be
19   getting hit by a truck."
20       What was that about it?
21       A    As I had said before, Allen Weisselberg was being
22   considered -- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  David Pecker was being
23   considered for the CEO position of another -- of Time Inc., and
24   the concern was the information, so "all the stuff" refers to
25   that.

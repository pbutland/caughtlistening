I And just between us, I will be Personal Counsel to President
2 Trump."
3 Q And does that help you date the time of this meeting
4 that you had with Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump when you
5 talked about the $420,000?
6 And in connection with you, were you also at that meeting
7 shortly thereafter being given the title Personal Counsel to
8 Mr. Trump?
9 A Yes.
10 Q I want to just go back to one question that I neglected
II to ask you.
12 That document that we looked at, People's Exhibit 35,
13 which contained the calculations that Allen Weisselberg did to
14 get you from 180 to 360 and adding the bonus, and so on, did Mr.
15 Weisselberg ever give you a copy of that document after all the
16 handwriting had been put on it?
17 A No.
18 Q What, if anything, did you know that he did with that
19 document; if you know?
20 A I believe —— I don't know. I believe he put it in a
21 file.
22 Q And so, is your sense that —— based on this document,
23 and perhaps another one, did you have a sense of the approximate
24 timing of the meeting that you had with Allen Weisselberg and
25 Donald Trump about the reimbursement?

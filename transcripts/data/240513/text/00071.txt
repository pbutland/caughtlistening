M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3326
1   out to you after this deal was concluded?
2                MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
3                THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       Q    Now, after AMI finalized the deal with Karen McDougal
5   and paid the $150,000 for the life rights and also for the
6   other that she was going to be doing, did you have any
7   conversations with Mr. Pecker about Mr. Trump reimbursing AMI
8   for the money that AMI put out?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    Tell us a little bit about that?
11       A    So David had asked me when he should anticipate
12   receiving or being paid back the 150 thousand dollars.
13       He needed to get the 150 thousand dollars; that he wanted
14   the 150 thousand dollars back because it was too much money for
15   him to hide from the CEO of the parent company.
16       And he had also just laid out 30 thousand dollars
17   previously.
18       So he was putting pressure on me to speak to Mr. Trump and
19   to get the money back.
20       Q    Did you have several conversations with Mr. Pecker
21   where he urged you to try to move it along and get him repaid?
22       A    Yes.  I -- I don't know if I would characterize it as
23   urge as much as he insisted.
24       Q    Was he upset about it?
25       A    Very.

1       Q    And did you make public appearances for him and for
2   his campaign?
3       A    I did.
4       Q    Tell us a little bit about that. What kind of public
5   appearances?
6       A    I would make public appearances on television, CNN,
7   MSNBC, ABC, whoever, CBS. I would frequently provide comment to
8   press regarding different matters that kept popping up.
9       Q    Did you leverage your press contacts in that way, from
10   Mr. Trump's campaign?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Your relationships?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    Did you also develop some relationships with some key
15   people on behalf of the campaign who put together some kind of
16   committees or groups for him?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    Tell the jury a little bit about that.
19       A    So, while watching the rallies, I had gone to
20   Mr. Trump, and I said, "One of the things that I notice is that
21   it's very white. And we really need diversity. If you're going
22   to win, you're going to need diversity."
23       And so, I started a group called National Diversity
24   Coalition for Trump, along with Pastor Carol Scott, an
25   Evangelical Pastor from Cleveland, Ohio.

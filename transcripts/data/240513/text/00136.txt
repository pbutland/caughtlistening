1       Q.   Were you concerned about that?
2       A.   I was.
3       Q.   And what, if anything, did he say to you about that?
4       A.   Don't worry, he goes.  He goes:  How long do you think
5   I will be on the market for?  Not long.
6       Q.   What did you understand that to mean?
7       A.   He wasn't thinking about Melania.  This was all about
8   the campaign.
9       Q.   Now, those conversations that you had with Mr. Trump,
10   were they in person, on the phone, or both?
11       A.   Both.
12                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Now, can we put up now, please,
13        People's 63 in evidence.  Can you blow up the body of the

20            And it says:  Michael, please find Ms. Daniels'
21   Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement attached.
22            I have not filled in the Side Letter Agreement (SLA)
23   which identifies the parties to this agreement.

25   I are entitled to possession of the SLA.

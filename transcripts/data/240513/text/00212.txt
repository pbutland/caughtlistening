1       A    I did. I indulged them.
2       Q    For the reasons you explained, that you would have
3   liked --
4       A    I would have liked to have been considered. It would
5   have been right.
6       Again, it was solely for my ego.
7       Q    Now, at some point during this transitional time
8   period, so from November to December, did you pitch to
9   Mr. Trump another role for you after he became President?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    What was the role that you -- or the title role that
12   you pitched to him?
13       A    Personal Attorney to the President.
14       Q    And what were the reasons that you wanted that title,
15   that role, Personal Attorney to the President?
16       A    First of all, I thought that he would need it because
17   there was still outstanding matters that we were dealing with.
18       And every President has a personal attorney.
19       So, my thought was:  That way I can continue to protect
20   him, to do the things that he needed with these other matters
21   and it would be protected.
22       I also had another thought in mind, which was consulting.
23   And that's what I really wanted. Because it also afforded me
24   the opportunity to stay at home with -- or stay in New York
25   with my son, my daughter, my wife.

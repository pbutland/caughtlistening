1       Q.   Let me go back to your conversations with Mr. Davidson
2   about taking that article down from TheDirty.com.
3            Did you also have some conversations with the General
4   Counsel of Life & Style about what he might do if that article
5   wasn't taken down?
6       A.   Yes, ma'am.
7       Q.   What was the substance of that conversation?
8       A.   I would file an immediate lawsuit against him.
9       Q.   Ultimately, when you and Keith Davidson were able to
10   get that article down and to make sure -- actually, let me
11   withdraw and go back.
12            The General Counsel you spoke to at Life & Style, were
13   they involved in putting out a different -- another article at
14   around that time, separate from TheDirty.com?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And those conversations were about that separate
17   article, meaning In Touch magazine, and making sure that it
18   didn't come out in that magazine?
19       A.   Correct.
20       Q.   Thank you.
21            After you succeeded in making sure that the In Touch
22   article didn't come out, and Keith Davidson was working to take
23   down the article on TheDirty.com, did you update Mr. Trump to
24   let him know that it had been taken care of?
25       A.   I did, and gave the credit actually in that case to

2                Can you see if we can cull those out.

4       Q    Mr. Cohen, can you read those texts between yourself
5   and Keith Schiller on that same day, June 16th of 2016?
6       A    Yes, ma'am.
7       So, this is from me to Keith Schiller, asking:  "Can we
8   speak?  I need you."
9       Q    And what does he respond?
10       A    He then responds -- I didn't receive --
11       Q    His response?
12       A    I didn't receive a response back.
13       And so, I followed it up with another that says:  "You
14   there?"
15       He then responds to me:  "On Dallas."
16       I think he meant in Dallas.
17       I then respond to him:  "Where's The Boss?" Which, of
18   course, referenced Mr. Trump.
19       He then responds to me:  "Next to me."
20       And then, I then ask:  "Is he free to speak?"
21       Q    Why are you trying to reach Mr. Trump on this date of
22   June 16, 2016?
23       A    Regarding the Karen McDougal matter.
24       Q    Was it an update that -- in response to an update that
25   you had just received from Dylan Howard about a meeting with
                           Lisa Kramsky,

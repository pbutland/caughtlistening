1       You said "everybody".
2       Do you mean you're aware of other executives who --
3       A    I apologize.
4       Yes. Other executives.
5       Q    So, they would report back to him, as well?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    But, you felt it was part of your job, and what he
8   wanted from you, to promptly report to him when you were
9   handling a matter for him about the progress and whether it was
10   resolved?
11       A    Yes.And that's what I did.
12       Q    Did you have a sense or did you learn from your
13   experiences with him that if you didn't keep him updated or
14   things didn't go well that you were working on, that that would
15   create an issue for Mr. Trump?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    Can you explain that just a little bit?
18       A    If you didn't immediately provide him with the
19   information and he learned of it in another manner, that
20   wouldn't go over well for you.
21       Q    To the extent that you discussed the requirement to
22   report frequently to Mr. Trump, was it your sense, based on
23   working with him, that he was a micromanager about the work of
24   his organization and of which he was concerned?
25       A    Yes, ma'am.

1       "He agreed to that.  He fears she has been convinced to tell
2   her story at ABC.  And really wants to.  I implored my guy to
3   GET IT DONE."  All caps.  "He's getting back to me."
4       Q    Is that the last text?
5       A    No.
6       Q    I'm sorry.  I apologize.
7       A    I then respond back to him:  "Okay."
8       To which he then responds to me:  "We are having a video
9   conference with her next week to outline the opportunities we
10   will present to -- we will present her to sign up with us."
11       I then ask:  "Do you know what day?"
12       And he responds to me:  "Monday or Tuesday."
13       And I respond again:  "Okay.  Thank you."
14       Q    Now, why were you pressing for this information from
15   Dylan Howard?
16       A    So several things here.  One, I wanted to know what the
17   number was, because I would have to report that to Mr. Trump.
18       When they stated that they are having a video conference
19   with her next week to outline the opportunities, I needed to
20   know what day, again, so that I could update Mr. Trump, and he
21   could have all the necessary information.
22       Q    Did you also speak to David Pecker around this time
23   about how things were moving along in the negotiation with Karen
24   McDougal and her lawyers?
25       A    Yes.

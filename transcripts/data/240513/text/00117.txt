1 of where you were and what you were doing when you had these
2 phone calls with him?
3 A Yes.
4 Q What were you doing?
5 A I was with my family and friends in London.
6 Q London.
7 Were you having dinner?
8 A I was.
9 Q Did you step out to take these calls?
10 A I did.
11 Q And what, if any, discussion do you remember with
12 Mr. Trump about the Access Hollywood tape and the strategy for
13 dealing with it?
14 A He wanted me to reach out to all of my contacts with
15 the media. We needed to put a spin on this. And the spin that
16 he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk,
17 something that Melania had recommended, or at least he told me
18 that that’s what Melania had thought it was. And use that in
19 order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact
20 on him and his campaign.
21 Q And what, if anything, did you do at that point to try
22 to assist the campaign with that effort?
23 A I reached out to members of the media.
24 Q And, in addition —— when you say you reached out to
25 members in the media, did you have conversations with them?

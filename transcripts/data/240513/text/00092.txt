11   did you ever alter that recording?
12       A    No.

18       Q    Now, I want to go back to your conversation with
19   Mr. Trump on that audio recording where you mentioned having
20   spoken with Allen Weisselberg about setting this whole thing
21   up.
22            Do you remember that?
23       A    I do.
24       Q    I just want to go back to you -- was it typical for
25   you to discuss financial matters with Allen Weisselberg?

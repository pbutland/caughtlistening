M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger

1       And I was just -- just personally insulted.
2       Q    Did you ask Mr. Pecker to help you with it?
3       A    I -- I don't recall.
4       Q    Did you also complain to Keith Davidson about it at
5   some point?
6       Do you remember having a phone call with him?
7       A    I might have had a phone call with Keith Davidson.
8       Q    Also complaining about the situation?
9       A    I may have mentioned it.
10       I'm not so sure that -- Keith Davidson and I didn't really
11   know each other, other than his representation of Ms. Clifford
12   and Ms. Daniels, whereas David Pecker I had a much longer
13   relationship with.  So, I'm not sure that I was complaining to
14   Keith Davidson as much as I probably just mentioned it.
15       Q    Now, did you go away with your family on holiday?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    And did Mr. Trump call you while you were on vacation?
18       A    He did.
19       Q    Can you tell the jury a bit about that conversation?
20       A    He called me just before New Years, just to say:
21   Hello.  How are things going?  Are you enjoying the vacation?
22   Next year, you should come to Mar-a-Lago.  Don't worry about
23   that other thing.  I'm going to take care of it when we get
24   back.
25       Q    What did you understand him to mean by that?

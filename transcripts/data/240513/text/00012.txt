1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And was -- I think you mentioned before; but, when you
3   started, what was your title?
4       A    Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald
5   J. Trump.
6       Q    And just in terms of your salary and your bonus,
7   approximately all in, how much were you making at The Trump
8   Organization?
9       A    525,000.
10       Q    And did that change over the years or did it, largely,
11   stay the same?
12       A    Well, it changed. Initially, after the second year, he
13   cut my salary. Ultimately gave it back, two years after that.
14   But it stayed the same.
15       Q    Tell the jury a little bit about what kind of matters
16   you handled for Donald Trump at The Trump Organization during
17   that ten years.
18       A    It was whatever concerned him, whatever he wanted.
19       Um, initially, when I first started working at The Trump
20   Organization, I was presented with an opportunity, and I
21   brought it to Mr. Trump immediately. We liked it. It was in New
22   Jersey. It was called the EnCap Golf Redevelopment Project. It
23   was a 1,000-acre landfill remediation project.
24       And this was all very exciting to me because it was all
25   new, and I enjoyed the challenge.

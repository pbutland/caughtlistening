5 Thank you.
6 Q. Now, after you learned from Dylan Howard and from Keith

8 publish that story, and the conversations about purchasing that
9 story, did you speak to Mr. Trump?
10 A. I did.
11 Q. Can you tell us —— first of all, why did you speak to
12 Mr. Trump about it?
13 A. Because it was a matter that affected him and because
14 that was what I always did, which was, to keep him abreast of
15 everything.
16 Q. Was this also a serious matter at that time?
17 A. A very serious matter.
18 Q. Did you tell him what you had heard from Dylan Howard
19 and Keith Davidson?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And what was his reaction?
22 A. He was really angry with me: I thought you had this
23 under control. I thought you took care of this.
24 1 expressed to Mr. Trump: We did, 2011. I have no
25 control over what she goes out and does.

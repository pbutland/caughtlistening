M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3350
1       A    So, I went to Allen's office.  I expressed to him that
2   we need funding of $150,000 to consummate this transaction.
3            Allen then said to me:  Well, if we do it from a Trump
4   entity, that kind of defeats the purpose because the point is
5   not to have the Trump name affiliated to this at all.  It's
6   really to create a barrier.
7            And so, he asked me to think about ways that we could
8   raise the $150,000.
9       Q    Before we get to that for a moment, in terms of
10   opening up a separate LLC to handle it, did you have a
11   conversation with Mr. Allen Weisselberg about that?
12                 MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
13                 THE COURT:  You can answer.
14       A    No.  I just told him I was going to open up a LLC.
15       Q    Was there a discussion about doing that to make it
16   more difficult to track directly to either Mr. Trump or The
17   Trump Organization?
18       A    It was in order to keep it separate.
19       Q    And, approximately, how many conversations do you
20   think you had with Mr. Weisselberg about the McDougal
21   transaction?
22       A    Maybe 10, 12.
23       Q    Now, did there come a time that you had some
24   conversations and began working with someone named Daniel
25   Rotstein associated with AMI in terms of effectuating this

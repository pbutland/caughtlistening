1 Non—Disclosure Agreement and the Side Letter.
2 Q. What was your goal in having those communications with
3 Keith Davidson?
4 A. In order to ensure that that occurred, so I could
5 express to Mr. Trump as an update that this matter is under
6 control.
7 Q. Did you in any of these conversations mention to Keith
8 Davidson that maybe AMI would still do the payoff instead of on
9 your side?
10 A. I might have.
11 Q. Why was that?
12 A. I was hoping that AMI was going to make the payment.
13 Q. But, at the end of the day, you knew they were not; is
14 that correct?
15 A. That is correct.
16 MS. HOFFINGER: You may take that down.
17 Can you now put up People’s 342 in evidence.
18 The calls, again, between Mr. Cohen and

1   additions and the calculations there that Mr. Weisselberg
2   wrote?
3       A    So you take 360 and add 60 to it, it was 420,000.
4       Q    And what, if anything, did he indicate about the
5   420,000 at that point, if anything?
6       A    Well, he didn't at that point.  It was only after we
7   had spoken to Mr. Trump about the $420,000 which, obviously, I
8   realized that they had already spoken.
9       Q    Before you get to that.  Just one question.  I
10   apologize.
11       I just want to go back to something on the issue of Allen
12   Weisselberg telling you that they were going to gross up the 180
13   that you had put out or stated that you had put out as an
14   expense, of grossing it up to $360,000, so that it would appear
15   to be income.
16       What was your understanding about Mr. Weisselberg's
17   background in terms of accounting and taxes?
18       A    He's not a CPA.  He has been Mr. Trump's CFO for well
19   over four decades.
20       Q    And as Chief Financial Officer, what is your
21   understanding about whether he oversaw the Accounting Department
22   at The Trump Organization?
23       A    He oversaw every aspect of the Accounting Department.
24       Q    And, to your knowledge, did he also work with outside
25   tax accountants?

1 A Yes. It was something that Reince Priebus had offered
2 to me.
3 Q Did you want that role of Assistant General Counsel?
4 A No, ma’am.
5 Q Did Mr. Trump or anybody working for him on the
6 transition team ever offer you the position of Chief of Staff?
7 A No, ma’am.
8 Q Was that disappointing for you, that you were not
9 offered or your name was not considered for that role?
10 A Yes.
11 Q Explain.
12 What was the disappointment?
13 A Well, I didn’t want the role. I didn’t believe the
14 role was right for me or that I was even competent to be Chief
15 of Staff.
16 I just wanted my name to have been included in the fact
17 that I had not once, but twice, started the campaign, been a
18 surrogate. After all of this going through, I had other ideas
19 for myself, what I wanted, but I wanted to at least be
20 considered.
21 It was more about my ego than anything.
22 Q Did some of your friends or your colleagues suggest to
23 you that you should have been considered for that role?
24 A Yes.
25 Q Did you indulge some of that conversation?

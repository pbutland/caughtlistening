M. Cohen — Direct/Hoffinger
3271
1 Q Did you renegotiate other bills for Mr. Trump at The
2 Trump Organization, besides the ones that you just mentioned?
3 A Yes.
4 Q From your experience over the ten years working at The
5 Trump Organization, are you aware whether Mr. Trump directed
6 other employees or executives to negotiate bills, not to take
7 the first bill, but to negotiate them down?
8 A Yes.
9 Q Let me ask you a question, Mr. Cohen. During the years
10 that you worked for Mr. Trump at The Trump Organization, did
11 you threaten, at times, to sue people or companies during those
12 years?
13 A Yes.
14 Q And explain why you did that.
15 A Well, it would depend on what the issue was.
16 We had an issue, for example, with a Miss USA Pageant
17 contestant, who —— Mr. Trump was being defamed, the Miss
18 Universe Organization, so he brought an arbitration against
19 her. That matter, ultimately, got resolved.
20 If —— with the press, as an example, that if they said
21 something that angered him, I would reach out to the press, and
22 I would express to them their need to either redact or take the
23 article down or we would file an action against them.
24 Q Did you do that in a strong and threatening manner at
25 times?

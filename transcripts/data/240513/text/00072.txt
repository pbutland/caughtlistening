1       Q    So directing your attention now to about September of
2   2016.  Did you have lunch with Mr. Pecker where he pressed you
3   further on that matter?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    Can you tell us a little bit about that matter?
6       A    So he asked me if I would meet him at his favorite
7   Italian restaurant, and I went to meet with him.
8       And, again, he expressed his anger that:  I need to get this
9   money back.
10       And I said:  Look, Mr. Trump told you that he would pay you
11   back, so he'll pay you back.
12       Q    Did you -- after the lunch meeting with Mr. Pecker
13   where he was, as you say, upset about not being repaid, did you
14   talk to Mr. Trump about that?
15       Did you inform him of that?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    And what did Mr. Trump say, in substance, about David
18   Pecker's concerns about getting it paid?
19       A    Don't worry.  I'll take care of it.
20       Q    And did you discuss with Mr. Trump David Pecker's
21   request for that money back on one occasion or more than one
22   occasion?
23       A    Several occasions.
24       Q    Around the same time, did you have any conversations
25   with Mr. Trump regarding other stories that AMI may have had in

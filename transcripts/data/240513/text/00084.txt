M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3339
1       Q    Now, you mentioned the word "financing," and Mr. Trump
2   asked you about that.
3       Can you explain that?
4       A    That was not the best usage of the word, what I really
5   meant was funding, not financing.
6       Q    And what did you mean by what you had -- what needed to
7   be funded?
8       A    How much money needed to be paid.
9       Q    Paid to who?
10       A    Paid to David Pecker, AMI.
11       Q    Okay.  And is that what you understood by, "We will
12   have to pay him something?"
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    By "we have to pay him something?"
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    What did you understand Mr. Trump to mean by saying,
17   "Pay with cash?"
18       A    Well, to pay in green, which would, obviously, be one
19   way to avoid any type of a paper transaction, but that's not
20   what I thought was the best way to do it.
21       Q    And so, is that why you said, "No?"
22       A    Correct.
23                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Did you want to take a break, your
24        Honor?
25                THE COURT:  It's up to you.

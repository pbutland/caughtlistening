1       A    Yes.  The transfer of the McDougal life rights, as
2   well as the other documents.
3       Q    Now, why does this agreement reference $125,000
4   instead of $150,000, which was the payment to Karen McDougal?
5       A    So, David had expressed to me that we are going to
6   reduce it from 150 to 125, on the basis that 125 was going to
7   represent the life rights because they were engaged with Karen
8   McDougal for two covers, as well as 24 penned articles; that
9   the compensation to her for that was going to be $25,000.
10            That's what they would have on their books claiming

17       Q    And who did you understand was, ultimately, going to
18   pay the $125,000 for the life rights to that material?
19       A    Mr. Trump.
20       Q    Were you planning on owning the life rights to that
21   story?
22       A    No, ma'am.
23       Q    Why not?
24       A    I had no reason to own -- no need to own the life
25   rights.  What I was doing, I was doing at the direction and for

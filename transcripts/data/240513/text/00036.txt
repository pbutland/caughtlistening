1       A    So, just some colorfulness.
2       In 2011, when Mr. Trump decided not to run, he actually
3   promised me that he was going to do it in the next election
4   cycle. And for years thereafter, we would talk about him
5   running in 2015.
6       At the very beginning, when he ultimately said, "I'm doing
7   it," there was a lot of back and forth about which date the
8   announcement should be.
9       A very small group of people were attached to the campaign
10   when it first launched.
11       Q    Did you have some discussions directly with Mr. Trump
12   about what your role might be in terms of assisting with his
13   campaign?
14       A    I wasn't going to be part of it.
15       I was just going to be a surrogate.
16       Q    Explain what you mean by "surrogate".
17       A    Sure.
18       "Surrogate" was someone who speaks on behalf of the
19   candidate and defends him in the press. Speaks to the press,
20   provides color, but not as a member of the campaign, but,
21   rather, as an outside person. So, again, as to give the
22   appearance that it's unbiased.
23       Q    And that's the role that you performed for him and for
24   the campaign?
25       A    Yes.

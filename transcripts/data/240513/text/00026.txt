1       Q    From your perspective, is that in some ways an
2   accurate title, an accurate moniker?
3       A    It's fair.
4       Q    I just want to ask you some questions about your
5   telephone numbers, and I'm going to ask you only about the last
6   four digits of some of those numbers.
7       During the period of 2015 to 2017, when you were working at
8   The Trump Organization, did you use a cell phone number ending
9   in 6866?
10       A    I did.
11       Q    Did you also use a cell phone number ending in 0114?
12       A    I did.
13       Q    And did you continue to use those two numbers for a
14   period of time after you left The Trump Organization?
15       A    Yes, ma'am.
16       Q    Do you still continue to this day to use the cell
17   phone number ending 0114?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Now, during the time that you worked at The Trump
20   Organization for Mr. Trump, you also had a landline work
21   number; is that right?
22       A    That's correct.
23       Q    Was that 212-836-3212?
24       A    Yes, ma'am.
25       Q    Obviously, you no longer use that number?

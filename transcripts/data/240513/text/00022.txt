M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3277
1   was there at The Trump Organization about executives coming in
2   to meet with Mr. Trump?
3       A    Mr. Trump had an open-door policy, which, if there was
4   somebody in there, you waited; and if not, you knocked on the
5   door, and I would say, "Boss, do you have a second?", and I
6   would walk right in.
7       Q    And others did the same, to your knowledge?
8       A    To my knowledge, yes.
9       Q    Now, when you met with Mr. Trump at The Trump
10   Organization, in his office, did you, generally, need -- I'm
11   sorry.
12       Did you, generally, record those meetings in your calendar?
13       A    No, ma'am.
14       Q    As part of your work at The Trump Organization, did
15   you feel that it was part of your job to keep him updated on
16   matters that you were handling for him?
17       A    Yes. It was actually required.
18       Q    Tell us what you mean by that.
19       A    When he would task you with something, he would then
20   say, "Keep me informed. Let me know what's going on."
21       And what he was saying, what everybody did is, as soon as
22   you had a result, an answer, you would go straight back and
23   tell him. Especially if it was a matter that was troubling to
24   him.
25       Q    So, two things, just to break that down.

2       Q    So -- and I apologize.
3       Was that the second email in this email chain, was there a
4   prior email?
5       A    Yes.
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we blow up the prior email.
7                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
8       Q    And you can describe the prior email that preceded
9   Mr. Davidson's response. Your email.
10       A    Sure.
11       Prior to the receipt of Keith Davidson's response, I had
12   sent to Keith:  "Kindly confirm that the wire received today,
13   October 27, 2016, shall be held by you in your attorney's trust
14   account until such time as directed for release by me, in
15   writing. Additionally, please ensure that all paperwork
16   contains the correct name of Essential Consultants LLC. I thank
17   you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing
18   from you later. Yours, Michael."
19       Q    Why did you send this email to Keith Davidson?
20       A    I sent it to him to ensure that the wire was received
21   by him, that he had properly corrected the name on the
22   paperwork to reflect Essential Consultants LLC, and to ask
23   him -- direct him, as an attorney through his lawyer's IOLA
24   account, not to disburse any funds to Ms. Daniels or anyone
25   else until such time as directed by me.

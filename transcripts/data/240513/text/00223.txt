1 Q What was your understanding about whether your

3 What was your understanding about whether your anger had any
4 impact on Mr. Weisselberg?
5 A I think it did, in light of all of the things that I
6 had just been involved with and helped to resolve. I was, even
7 for myself, unusually angry. (Laughter.)
8 Q Did you complain to a few other people also about your
9 anger about not being repaid and also having your bonus cut?
10 A I'm sure I did.
11 Q Do you know whether you expressed your upset with David
12 Pecker?
13 A I'm sure I did.
14 Q Do you recall specifically any conversation with David
15 Pecker about your end—of—year bonus?
16 A Yes.
17 Q Can you just tell the jury a little bit about that,
18 what you recall?
19 A Yeah. I engaged him in conversation: Could you
20 believe this? I mean, it's like after all of this, and laying
21 out $130,000 to protect him, this is the best that I get?
22 And I couldn't believe it.
23 I was really —— I —— and it was, it wasn't even so much
24 about the number as much as it was about the, sort of,
25 disrespect that came with it.

6 Narrative."

8 Q. And if could you read that to the jury, Mr. Cohen?
9 A. Yes, ma'am.
10 It states: Michael Cohen is opening Essential
11 Consultants LLC as a real estate consulting company to collect
12 fees for investment —— it should say consultation work —— he
13 does for real estate deals. It is dated October 26, 2016.
14 Q. And was that business narrative description on the KYC
15 form true or false?
16 A. It's false.
17 Q. Why didn't you give them the true reason of setting up
18 that account?
19 A. To hide the intent of the reason for opening Essential
20 Consultants, which is to pay for a Non—Disclosure Agreement.
21 Q. Did you have an understanding as to whether the bank
22 may or may not open such an account if you had given them a true
23 reason?
24 A. I believe they probably would not.
25 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

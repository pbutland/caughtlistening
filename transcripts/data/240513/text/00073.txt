1   the past and some concerns about that?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Can you tell the jury a little bit about that?

5   relationship with Mr. Trump goes back many, many years and there
6   is a file drawer or a locked drawer, as he described it, where
7   files that relate to Mr. Trump existed.
8       And, at that point in time, David was being considered for

10       And one of the concerns that I had, that I expressed to
11   Mr. Trump, was if he goes, there is a series of papers there
12   that relate to you.
13       Q    And what was your concern, specifically, with respect
14   to those stories and Mr. Pecker leaving AMI?
15       A    Well, I didn't know what those stories were, and nobody
16   was discussing that with me, but that they would be open for
17   use.

20       A    Yes.  Because we didn't know who the potential CEO or
21   replacement would be.
22       Q    And was Mr. Trump concerned about that at that point as
23   well?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    Did you discuss with Mr. Pecker those concerns about

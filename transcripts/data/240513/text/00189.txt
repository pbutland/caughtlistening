M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3444
1       I wanted to ensure that I received the executed
2   Non-Disclosure Agreement, as promised, before they released
3   funds.
4       Q    At this point, you didn't yet have the signed
5   Agreement from Ms. Daniels; correct?
6       A    Correct. The signed Agreement and the Side Letter
7   Agreement.
8                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.
9                 You can take that down.
10       Q    Now, after you wired that money to Keith Davidson, did
11   you then receive the final Non-Disclosure Agreement and the
12   Side Letter signed by Ms. Daniels?
13       A    I did.
14       Q    What were the general terms of the Agreement?
15       Were they the same as the Agreement that had been sent to
16   you on October 11th?
17       A    Yes.
18       In consideration for the $130,000, that she had transferred
19   all rights assigned to the life rights of the story, and it
20   also contained/states punitive damages of $1 million per
21   violation clause.
22       Q    Did you let Mr. Trump know once you received it that
23   you had it?
24       A    Immediately.
25       Q    Why did you do that?

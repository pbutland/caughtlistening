M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3305
1       Q    What did you tell them?
2       A    Ummm, I thought that there needed to be a clause in
3   there, a significant penalty for a million dollars per violation
4   of any of the terms of the Agreement to ensure that the doorman
5   knew not to go ahead and to talk about this matter.
6       Q    So, you suggested that there be a heavy hammer to make
7   sure that he didn't break the terms of the Agreement?
8       A    Yes, ma'am.
9       Q    Did you also suggest some other term involving
10   perpetuity for this Agreement?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Can you explain that?
13       A    What I found was that the Agreement had what I
14   considered to be an end date to it.
15       And so, rather, I said why not just -- let's make this in
16   perpetuity.
17       Q    What does that mean, "in perpetuity?"
18       A    It means that it's forever.  That he owns the
19   document -- they own the story forever.  And it can never come
20   out.
21       Q    And did AMI agree to include that term as well in the
22   Agreement?
23       A    He did.
24                MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we put up, please, People's 165
25       in evidence.

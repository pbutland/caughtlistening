M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3343
1   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
2       Q    Now, Mr. Cohen, when we ended off before the break, I
3   was asking you about Mr. Trump saying something about paying in
4   cash.
5            Why did you think it was a bad idea for Mr. Trump's
6   suggestion that this be paid in cash?
7       A    Because we needed to acquire the information, the
8   documents, and I believed that the proper way to do it would be
9   by check and make it appear to be a proper transaction.
10       Q    Now, at the end of the tape it cuts off, and there is
11   a voice that's heard at the end of the tape before it cuts off.
12            Whose voice is that?
13       A    It's my voice.
14       Q    And what do you recall about why that recording cut
15   off that way with your voice?
16       A    Because I received an incoming phone call.
17       Q    And what do you understand you were saying in that
18   last piece when you hear your voice?
19       A    Hello, are you there?
20       Q    Now, why did you -- when you tried to take that call,
21   you said the incoming call you thought was coming in, did the
22   recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump end at that
23   point?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And why did you try to take that call instead of

1 today, but can speak for the next three hours via cell if
2 necessary.
3 Q. Just to orient the jury, was that the first email, the
4 one at the bottom, and the response by Keith Davidson at the
5 top?
6 A. Yes.
7 Then it is followed by Keith Davidson to me: We good.
8 Q. So, what was happening at this time?
9 A. Continue to delay. Delay the execution of the
10 documents. Continue the delay of execution of funding.
11 In this specific case, I used the holiday of Yom Kippur
12 as a way of just, once again, trying to delay it, which is until
13 after the election.
14 Q. And the reason for that?
15 A. Because after the election it wouldn't matter.
16 Q. And according to who?
17 A. According to Mr. Trump.
18 Q. Now, around this time, the middle of October or so, did
19 you have some more conversations with Mr. Trump about Keith
20 Davidson pushing for payment around this time?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. And what was his response?
23 A. I mean, I'm incredibly busy right now. There is a lot
24 going on. I am travelling all over. I don't have time to think
25 about this right now. Just give me a few days.

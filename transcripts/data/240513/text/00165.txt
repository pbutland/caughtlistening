M. Cohen â€” Direct/Hoffinger
3420
1 Q. At some point, did you have a conversation with
2 Mr. Trump about the fact that you were willing to pay for it, at
3 least initially?
4 A. Yes. Allen and I spoke to Mr. Trump. We expressed to
5 him that I was going to front the money for it. To which he was
6 appreciative and: Good, good.
7 Q. Did you have a sense from Mr. Trump that you would end
8 up being out the money or you would get paid back?
9 A. He stated about it: Don't worry about it. You will
10 get the money back.
11 Q. Would you have ever paid for the NDA for Stormy Daniels
12 on your own without an understanding that you would get paid
13 back?
14 A. No.
15 Q. Why not?
16 A. It's $130,000. I was doing everything that I could and
17 more in order to protect my boss, which was something I had done
18 for a long time. But I would not lay out $130,000 for an NDA
19 needed by somebody else.
20 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we bring up now People's
21 Exhibit 342. Let's show those to the jury.
22 (Displayed)
23 Q. Do you recognize these? What are these, Mr. Cohen?
24 A. These are phone calls made from my cell phone to Allen
25 Weisselberg.

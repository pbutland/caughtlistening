1 A I did.
2 Q Explain why you did that.
3 A So, one of my clients was leaving the country to move
4 to Israel, and it gave me the opportunity to buy 50 percent
5 interest in a company called Manhattan Maintenance. That was
6 1995. And so I did.
7 I thought it was, and it turned out to be at that time, a
8 very good investment.
9 Q Did you also invest in some real estate along the
10 years?
11 A I did.
12 Q Tell us a little bit about that.
13 A I started purchasing new developments, specifically in
14 Trump properties. My very first one, in the year 2000, was at
15 Trump World Tower. I also bought on 60th Street, 431 —— I'm
16 sorry. It was called Bridge Tower on 60th Street.
17 Ultimately, down the road, I ended up going into business
18 with a friend of mine who had grown up with me, and we started
19 purchasing buildings.
20 Q Did there come a time when you became a partner in a
21 law firm called Phillips, Nizer?
22 A Yes.
23 Q What kind of work did you do there?
24 A I was, basically, doing business and corporate law.
25 Q Did there come a time when you left Phillips, Nizer?

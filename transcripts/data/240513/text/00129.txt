3 Q. As a result of your efforts and Keith Davidson's
4 efforts, did that article —— either article in 2011, get any
5 traction in 2011, meaning, was it out there much?
6 A. No, ma'am.
7 Q. So, let me now move past 2011. Between that in 2011
8 and 2016, when you found out from Dylan Howard that Stormy
9 Daniels' story had resurfaced again, in between that time, had
10 you heard anything more about the Stormy Daniels matter?
11 A. Nothing.
12 Q. Now, when you learned on October 8th from Dylan Howard
13 that the Stormy Daniels story had resurfaced, did you also learn
14 from Mr. Howard that there was an attorney who would be
15 representing Stormy Daniels in the matter?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. What did he tell you?
18 A. Keith Davidson, he was going to be representing Stormy
19 Daniels.
20 Q. And was that the same lawyer who had represented her in
21 2011 that you worked with?
22 A. Yes. We had, obviously, a positive result.
23 MS. HOFFINGER: So let me ask to, please, put up

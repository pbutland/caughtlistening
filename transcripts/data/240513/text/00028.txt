1       A    That's correct.
2       Q    What kind of information, just generally, was in your
3   contacts on those phones?
4       A    Names, email addresses, potential addresses, cell
5   phone numbers, home numbers, fax numbers.
6       Q    Were there also, sometimes, other information
7   associated with folks whose contacts you had in there?
8       A    Yes, ma'am.
9       Q    Did you keep anybody else's contacts in your phone, as
10   well?
11       A    Personal ones, yes.
12       Q    In other words, however -- what I'm asking about is
13   not just your contacts, of your contacts and the folks that you
14   know; but, did you also, at some point, include or sync with
15   your contacts somebody else's contacts?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    Tell the jury about that.
18       A    Actually, I didn't do it. It was done by the IT
19   people.
20       I was spending a significant amount of time with Mr. Trump;
21   and we ultimately decided -- he agreed -- to have his contact
22   numbers synced to my cell number, to my account as well.
23       That way, if we needed to travel, if he needed to get
24   somebody on the phone, he would just say, "Michael, get me" so
25   and so "on the line," and I would have them in my cell phone.

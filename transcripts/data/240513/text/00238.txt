1   to question you about it.
2       Did you say something to the effect of that you had the
3   sense that they had spoken about this previously?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    Why do you say that?
6       A    Because they always played that sort of game of frick
7   and frack type game.
8       And I didn't -- I had been around that office more than
9   enough to realize that this conversation had already taken place
10   between the two.
11       And when I asked for the 420; Mr. Trump said, no, it's
12   better, it's better to do it over the 12 months.
13       Q    And --
14                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, objection to that answer
15       and move to strike.
16                THE COURT:  Overruled.  Overruled.
17       Q    And when Allen Weisselberg laid out the plan of how
18   much you were going to get paid and over what months and showed
19   Mr. Trump this document, did Mr. Trump try to renegotiate?
20       A    No.
21       Q    So he approved it at that point?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    Now, at some point did Mr. Trump confirm to you that he
24   was going to give you the title of Personal Attorney or Personal
25   Counsel to the President?

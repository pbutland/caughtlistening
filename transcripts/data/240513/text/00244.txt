1   would be compensated for any legal work that you might do for
2   him in the future in that role?
3       A    No.
4       Q    Did you -- did it come up at all, whether, you know, if
5   you did some work, whether you would be paid for it?
6       A    I mean, when he said to me, yeah, you know, whatever
7   you end up doing, you know, just take it easy on any bills, he
8   goes.  But I knew what he was referring to.  He had given me
9   this title, his Personal Attorney, and I was proud to accept
10   that title, which I wanted, so I knew that there would be no
11   compensation for any of the other work.
12       Q    And so, did you have any expectation that if you did
13   work for him you would be paid?
14       A    None at all.
15       Q    And, from your perspective, how were you essentially
16   getting paid for that title?
17       A    By monetizing the role as Personal Attorney and
18   creating consulting agreement relationships.
19       Q    Now, are you aware that when attorneys represent a
20   client and receive compensation for work, that they are required
21   to put together either a Retainer Agreement or a written
22   Engagement Letter?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And did you ever put together any sort of a Retainer
25   Agreement for any future work that you might do for Mr. Trump as

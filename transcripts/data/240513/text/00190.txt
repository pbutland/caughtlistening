M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3445
1       A    For two reasons.
2       One, so that he would know the matter, the task that he
3   gave to me was finished, accomplished and done.
4       But, also, to take credit for myself, so he knew that I had
5   done and finished it. Because this was important.
6       Q    Let's take a look at the Agreement first.
7       Actually, let's take a look at -- let's take a look at the
8   Agreement first.
9                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Let's put up People's 276,
10        please.
11                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12       Q    Is this the final Settlement Agreement and Side Letter
13   Agreement signed regarding the Stormy Daniels matter?
14       A    This is one page of it, yes.
15       Q    We can scroll down just so that you see it is the
16   final Agreement.
17                 (Whereupon, the exhibit scrolls on the screens.)
18       A    (Nods yes.) Yes, ma'am.
19       Q    Did Mr. Trump sign this Agreement anywhere?
20       A    No.
21       Q    Why not?
22       A    Because, again, the purpose of it was to ensure his
23   name didn't appear anywhere, as he's a candidate for the
24   Presidency of the United States of America, and this would not
25   have been to his benefit to do so.

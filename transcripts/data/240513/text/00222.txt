M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger

1       A    Yes.  I mentioned the fact that:  You didn't lay out
2   the money; I did.
3       You weren't prepared to lay it out; I did.
4       And the best that you get for showing loyalty, the best that
5   you get for extending yourself as I did is have your bonus cut
6   by two-thirds.
7       I didn't expect more, but I certainly didn't expect less.
8       Q    Did Mr. Weisselberg generally know what executives like
9   yourself were getting as bonuses end year?
10       A    Yes.  Every year Allen had the list, and he would sit
11   down with Mr. Trump and they would go through it before the
12   checks were prepared.
13       Q    And so, was part of your anger also at Mr. Weisselberg
14   for allowing your bonus to be cut?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    What was Mr. Weisselberg's response to you at that time
17   to the anger that you expressed to him?
18       A    Take it easy.  You know that Mr. Trump loves you.  We
19   are going to do right by you.  We will make sure that -- we are
20   going to make sure that you are taken care of.  Just go.  Enjoy
21   your vacation.  Relax.  We are going to do -- we will make this
22   right.
23       Q    And did he tell you when it would be made right?
24       A    After the holiday, when everybody returned to the
25   office.

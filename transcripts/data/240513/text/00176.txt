1        October 26, 2016, one at 8:30 a.m. -- two calls at about
2        the same time, actually, about 8:30 a.m.
3                 (Displayed.)
4       Q.   You see those two calls?
5       A.   Yes, I do.
6       Q.   How long was the call for?
7       A.   One is 3 minutes and 20 seconds.  The second one is for
8   1 minute and 28 seconds.
9       Q.   Did you call Mr. Trump before you went and set up the
10   account to make a transfer?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   What, in substance, did you discuss with him on these
13   two calls?
14       A.   I wanted to ensure that, once again, he approved what I
15   was doing because I required approval from him on all of this.
16   That's what the sum and substance of the conversation was,
17   laying out exactly what was going to happen, what was being done
18   in order to ensure the story didn't get sold to Daily Mail or
19   somebody else.
20       Q.   Did you let him know you were going across the street
21   and you were going to get the account set up and make the
22   payment?
23       A.   Yes, ma'am.
24       Q.   Would you have made that payment to Stormy Daniels
25   without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump?

2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Tell us a little bit about that.
4       A    Again, if it was in order to place a story that would
5   be advantageous in some way, shape or form, I would speak with
6   them.
7       If there was an article that caused him displeasure, I
8   would speak with them about that, as well.
9       Q    So, did you work with the press to try to minimize
10   negative stories and sort of enhance positive stories about
11   Mr. Trump and his business?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    Was that a good part of your work for him, interacting
14   with the press for him?
15       A    It was a portion of it, yes.
16       Q    Now, you mentioned that you worked at Trump Tower at
17   the Offices of The Trump Organization; is that right?
18       A    That's correct.
19       Q    During the time that you worked there, where,
20   approximately, was your office in relation to Mr. Trump's
21   office?
22       A    Well, initially, when I started, it was towards the
23   back of the office that was Ivanka's old office, until,
24   ultimately, I moved to a different office that was maybe
25   50 feet, 60 feet from his office.

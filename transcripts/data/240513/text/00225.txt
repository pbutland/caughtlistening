1       A    What he meant was the two-third diminution in the
2   bonus..
3       Q    Did he mention at all -- what, if anything, did he
4   mention about any conversation that he had with Allen
5   Weisselberg?

12   $130,000 that you had gave to Stormy Daniels?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    Tell us how that came about?
15       A    Well, it's now after the new year, and I had laid out

21       Q    And what, if anything, did he say about trying to
22   resolve that with you?
23       A    So he said to me:  "Let's sit down.  Let's meet and
24   let's do it."
25       Q    What, if anything, did he ask of you to provide to

1 continuing to tape the conversation with Mr. Trump?
2 A I must have believed it was an important phone call.
3 Q Was there another reason also that you were
4 comfortable ending the tape?
5 A Yes.
6 Q Tell us about that, please.
7 A I didn’t want to record more. I already had enough

9 convince him that he was going to receive the $150,000 back.
10 MS. HOFFINGER: Now, let’s put up, please, for
11 Mr. Cohen, what’s in evidence, a page from People's Exhibit
12 400. The page that’s Bates ending 2726, please.
13 (Displayed.)
14 Q Now, Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review this
15 record, this AT&T record regarding your call history?
16 A Yes.
17 Q And do you recognize it to be an AT&T record of calls
18 to or from your cell phone ending in 0114?
19 A Yes.
20 Q Does it appear to show an incoming call at around the
21 time that your recording of Mr. Trump cuts off?
22 A Yes.
23 Q And does that record indicate a call at around that
24 time that looks like it came in and perhaps went to voicemail?
25 A It says so, yes.

1   could publish it?
2       A    Correct.  Take it off the market.
3       Q    Now, did you update -- actually, when Dylan Howard and
4   Mr. Pecker told you they were going to do that, they were going
5   to acquire the life rights for $30,000, did you tell them that
6   Mr. Trump would be grateful?
7       A    Absolutely.
8       Q    And when you spoke to Mr. Trump about it, was he
9   grateful?
10       A    Absolutely.
11       Q    Now, did AMI at some point send you the Agreement --
12   their agreement with the doorman for those life rights for
13   $30,000?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    And did you review it?
16       A    I did.
17       Q    Why did you review it?
18       A    Well, I reviewed it to ensure that Mr. Trump was fully
19   protected.
20       I also asked them to send it to me so that I could show
21   Mr. Trump that it's being taken care of.
22       Q    And did you -- when you reviewed that Agreement, did
23   you provide AMI with any feedback about the terms in the
24   Agreement?
25       A    I did.

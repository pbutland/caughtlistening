1       A    No.
2       Q    And so, how did you feel about the situation of him
3   cutting your bonus and then also not repaying you yet for the
4   Stormy Daniels payout?
5       A    I was truly insulted, personally hurt by it.  I didn't
6   understand it.
7       It made no sense.
8       After all that I had gone through in terms of the campaign,
9   as well as things at The Trump Organization, in laying out
10   $130,000 on his behalf to protect him, it was insulting that
11   the gratitude shown back to me was to cut the bonus by
12   two-thirds.
13       Q    Did you express your anger about the situation to
14   Mr. Weisselberg?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    Would you tell the jury about your conversation with
17   Mr. Weisselberg about that?
18       A    So, right after opening it, I actually had to take a
19   double take and then immediately went to Mr. Weisselberg's
20   office in the back and in some very colorful language expressed
21   to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was.  This makes
22   no sense.  At all.
23       But I used quite a few expletives.
24       Q    Now, did you mention in that conversation with
25   Mr. Weisselberg that he also hadn't repaid you for the 130,000?

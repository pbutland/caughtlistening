1 with Mr. Trump about Stormy Daniels?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Can you tell us, in general, the gist of that
4 conversation?
5 A After I received the information from Dylan Howard, I
6 immediately went to Mr. Trump’s office, knocked on the door,
7 said, Boss, I got to speak to you. And I told him about the
8 conversation, the sum and substance of the conversation that I
9 just had with Dylan Howard.
10 And I asked him if he knew who she was.
11 He told me that he did.
12 And I stated about the story that existed on
13 TheDirty.com, that they had a relationship that occurred during
14 a golf outing going back to, like, 2006. And I told him that
15 one of the things that, you know, we need to do is we need to,
16 obviously, take care of it.
17 We need to absolutely do it, take care of it.

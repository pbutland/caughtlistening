2             LIEUTENANT:  All rise.
3             Part 59 is back in session.
4             THE COURT:  Mr. Blanche, in the past my practice
5   has always been when there is a tape or something like that
6   produced into evidence, I normally give some sort of
7   limiting instruction along the lines of, Jurors, I just
8   want you to know that the transcript is not evidence.  The
9   transcript is just an aid to assist you and it is the tape
10   that is evidence.
11             No one has requested that instruction.
12             Do you want to leave it like that, or would you
13   want me to give it?
14             MR. BLANCHE:  We would.
15             MS. HOFFINGER:  I believe the transcript is in
16   evidence.
17             THE COURT:  It is in evidence as an aid, and I am
18   going to give that instruction.
19             MR. BLANCHE:  If your Honor can give it even
20   right now, since we finished that part of the testimony,
21   that would make sense.
22             THE COURT:  Sure.
23             Let's bring the witness back, please.
24             LIEUTENANT:  Witness entering.

M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger

1       Q    Did there come a time, in 2011, that Mr. Trump was
2   exploring a run for the Presidency?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    Can you tell us a little bit about that?
5       A    So, in 2011, I had come across, while reading the
6   paper, a poll that stated 6 percent of all the people who had
7   taken the poll thought Mr. Trump should be President of the
8   United States of America.
9       And so, I took that article, and I brought it to Mr. Trump.
10   And I said, "What do you think?"
11       He said, "It's interesting. We should look into it."
12       Q    And did he look into it in some degree in 2011?
13       A    He did.
14       Q    Do you recall whether he spoke publicly in 2011 about
15   exploring a run for the Presidency?
16       A    He did.
17       That was posts I had created for him, my own website called
18   shouldtrumprun.com. And many people came to that website.
19       And it was further proof that his name recognition, his
20   popularity, especially because of the hit show The Apprentice,
21   was so strong.
22       Q    And just to go back to the question, do you remember
23   giving some public speech -- him giving public speeches about
24   his considering a run for the Presidency in 2011?
25       A    Yes.

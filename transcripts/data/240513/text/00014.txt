1   He didn't believe that the invoice was fair, reasonable,
2   justified. And so, he would give me the task of renegotiating a
3   specific bill.
4       Q    Did you ever renegotiate bills from other types of
5   vendors?
6       For example, regarding Trump University?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    Tell us a little bit about that.
9       A    So, Trump University fell into trouble, and there were
10   approximately 50 vendors that had not been paid.
11       There was a sum certain that was in the bank at the time.
12   Approximately $2 million. Unfortunately, the bills far exceeded
13   that $2 million. But, Trump was not going to fund the balance.
14       And so, what I did is I put them onto a spreadsheet, a
15   handwritten spreadsheet, divided it by the $2 million, and came
16   up with basically 20 percent of everyone's invoice.
17       I contacted each and every one of the vendors; and all but
18   two accepted, ultimately, the 20 percent.
19       We had Releases drafted. And upon the receipt of the
20   Release, within 48 hours, we had checks sent to them by FedEx.
21       Q    So, did Mr. Trump ask you to renegotiate all those
22   bills regarding Trump University?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And you said "all but two".
25       What happened with the other two vendors?

1   Mr. Davidson on that day.
2       A    I wanted to ensure that Ms. Daniels did not go rogue,
3   that any of the people that she had known weren't providing any
4   statements or information regarding this.
5       Q    Let me ask you also a question: Did you also discuss
6   with him Karen McDougal?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    Had Mr. Davidson represented Ms. McDougal, as well as
9   Stormy Daniels?
10       A    He represented both.
11       Q    What, if any, discussion did you have with him -- that
12   article we looked at was, largely, about Karen McDougal?
13       A    It was mostly, 95 percent of it, 99 percent of it was
14   Karen McDougal.
15       Q    What, if anything, did you discuss with Mr. Davidson
16   on those phone calls about Karen McDougal?
17       A    That she was also under control, that nobody is going
18   rogue here.
19       Q    In addition to that, did you express any anger at
20   Mr. Davidson for that article?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Why?
23       A    Because she was his client, and I expected that he
24   would have this under control.
25       Again, it was days before. And I wanted to ensure Mr. Trump

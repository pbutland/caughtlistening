13       A    Yes.
14       Q    What, generally, did you discuss with him?
15       A    The Karen McDougal article.
16       Q    Was there a concern -- what, if any, concern did
17   you -- on the part of AMI was there about this article?
18       A    Well, remember that AMI was now in contract with Karen
19   McDougal for the two covers as well as the, um, 24 articles
20   that were to be penned.
21       And I was expressing to him also, in a rather angry manner,
22   that: She's now part of your team. You need to get a hold of
23   this and also start issuing denials.
24                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down.
25                 Can you also put up 340 in evidence.

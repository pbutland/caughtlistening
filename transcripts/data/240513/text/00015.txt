M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger

1       A    They just went away.
2       Q    You mean -- did you pay them?
3       A    No, ma'am.
4       Q    Now, once you accomplished that task for Mr. Trump of
5   renegotiating all those bills with the Trump University, did
6   you report back to him?
7       A    Yes. But not in its totality.
8       Each and every Release was separate. I would go straight
9   into Mr. Trump's office, and I would advise him of the task
10   being accomplished.
11       Q    Why did you do that?
12       A    For two reasons.
13       The first was so that he knew I was on it and I was doing
14   what he had asked.
15       And the second was, really, to obtain credit so that he
16   understood that, again, I was accomplishing what he wanted.
17       Q    Do you have a memory of advising him about
18   accomplishing that task of reducing the payments to vendors and
19   his reaction? Do you have a memory of that?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    What do you remember him saying when you told him you
22   accomplished that task?
23       A    "It's fantastic. It's great."
24       Q    How did that make you feel?
25       A    Like I was on top of the world.

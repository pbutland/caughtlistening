1   document?
2       A    The purpose was to reflect $125,000 that was for the
3   assignment.
4       Q    Was it an invoice for the payment of that 125?
5       A    Yes, ma'am.
6       Q    And let me direct your attention to the description of
7   services.
8            It says, flat fee for advisory services for $125,000.
9            Do you see that?
10       A    I do.
11       Q    Was that description a truthful description about this
12   transaction?
13       A    No, ma'am.
14       Q    In truth, what was the $125,000 payment supposed to be
15   for?
16       A    For the life rights of Karen McDougal.
17       Q    And what's your understanding about why you got an
18   invoice, or why this invoice was from a company called,
19   Investment Advisory Services instead of AMI directly?
20       A    I never knew who they were.  I still, to this day,
21   don't.  It was clearly just to create separation in order to
22   mask the transaction.
23                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down.
24                 Thank you.
25       Q    Now, ultimately, you signed this Assignment Agreement

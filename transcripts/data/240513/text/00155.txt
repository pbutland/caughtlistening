l communications on October 17, 2016?
2 A. From me to Dylan Howard: Call me.
3 Then I responded back with three question marks because
4 I hadn't heard back.
5 This was obviously incredibly stressful and incredibly
6 important.
7 I finally receive a response back from Dylan Howard:
8 "Not taking my calls." And he was referencing there Keith
9 Davidson. "He's not talking my calls."
10 The goal is to figure out exactly what was going on and
ll what else could be done.
12 I then respond from me to Dylan: You're kidding.
13 Then I continue by saying: Who are you trying to
14 reach?
15 I wanted just to confirm that my suspicion that he was
16 trying to reach Keith Davidson and not maybe somebody else.
17 To which he responds thereafter: The agent.
18 "The agent" I knew to be Keith Davidson.
19 Q. Now, did you also speak by telephone that day with
20 Dylan Howard?
2l A. Yes, ma'am.
22 Q. And why did you speak with him by telephone?
23 A. This was of grave importance.
24 Q. What, if anything, did you understand at this point
25 about whether Stormy Daniels might end up in the Daily Mail?

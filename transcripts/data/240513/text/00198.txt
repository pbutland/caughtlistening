1 Q Do you recognize that?
2 A I do.
3 Q Tell the jury what that is. What's reflected in that
4 document?
5 A This is an email from Hope Hicks, dated Friday,
6 November 4, 2016, to me.
7 It states: "We have nothing to do with this final attempt
8 by the liberal elite to disparage Donald Trump and stop this
9 historic movement. We have no knowledge of this false story
10 allegedly being shopped around, although it comes as no
11 surprise —— yet another publicity hungry individual with a get
12 rich and famous quick scheme at the expense of Mr. Trump."
13 What she was sending to me was a series of ideas and
14 thoughts to use for the media and to put out to the media.
15 Again, to get control over the release of that article.
16 Q Was she sending you several different options for the
17 campaign to spin as a response to this article?
18 A Yes.
19 Q And was she looking for you to provide some advice to
20 her?
21 A Yes.
22 Q Did you offer your input here on the campaign —— the
23 Trump campaign's response?
24 A Yes.
25 Q Can we scroll up to your email response to her.

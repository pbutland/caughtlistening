1 THE COURT: Overruled.
2 A Yes.
3 Q What was your understanding?
4 A That this was going to be significantly impactful,
5 especially with women voters.
6 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.
7 You can take that down.
8 Can we now put up People’s Exhibit 167 in
9 evidence?
10 (Displayed.)
11 Q Do you recognize this email?
12 A I do.
13 Q Can you explain —— first, tell us who the email is
14 with, who it’s between and what it is about?
15 A So this is an email from Dylan Howard on October 8,
16 2016, to me with a CC to David Pecker.
17 The subject line is, Link.
18 It says, Evening. The only story was this posted in
19 October of 2006, before AMI owned it, and he is referring to
20 the old Radar Magazine.
21 The tape was not part of the story that existed
22 online. I suggest it would have been lost during the many site
23 changes over the years.
24 Nevertheless, I have deleted the text story. It no
25 longer exists. And he attaches a hyperlink of that story.

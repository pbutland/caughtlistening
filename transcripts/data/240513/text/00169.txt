l fund the deal?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Now, what was the plan for how you were going to fund
4 the Essential Consultants account in order to transfer the money
5 to Keith Davidson?
6 A. So, I had already, for several months at First Republic
7 Bank, before all of this, I had a HELOC, a Home Equity Line of
8 Credit, on my apartment. That account was paperless. Meaning,
9 that we wouldn't receive any documents in the mail.
10 And I elected to use money that was in the HELOC
ll because my wife was the CEO of the household and would not
12 understand if there was $130,000 missing from our joint bank
13 account. She would ask me, and I clearly could not tell her,
14 and that would have been a problem for me. So I elected to use
15 the HELOC.
16 And once I received the money back from Mr. Trump, I
17 would just deposit it and no one would be the wiser.
18 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we now put up People's l77A in
19 evidence.

21 MS. HOFFINGER: And cull out the text between
22 Mr. Howard and Mr. Cohen on October 25, 2016.
23 A. So, this is a text message from Dylan Howard to me.
24 And it states: Keith calling you urgently. We have to
25 coordinate something on the matter he's calling you about, or it

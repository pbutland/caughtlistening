M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3419
1       Q.   Did you suggest to Mr. Weisselberg about him funding
2   it?
3       A.   I did.
4                 MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
5                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
6       A.   I stated to Allen:  You're the CFO.  You're making
7   seven figures.  Why don't you pay it.  You'll get paid back.
8   You don't have to worry about that one.
9       Q.   What did he say?
10       A.   He said to me he wasn't financially in a position to do
11   it.  He stated:  Michael, as you know, I have my four grandkids
12   at prep school, and that I have summer camps for them that I am
13   paying for, I just can't do it.
14       Q.   What did you resolve between the two of you, yourself
15   and Weisselberg, ultimately?
16       A.   Well, because of the urgency that was happening and the
17   fact she was heading -- or at least they expressed to me they
18   were heading to the Daily Mail, I ultimately said:  Okay, I'll
19   pay it.
20       Q.   Was there any discussion at that time with
21   Mr. Weisselberg about you getting paid back eventually?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   What was discussed?
24       A.   Don't worry about it, I will make sure you get paid
25   back.

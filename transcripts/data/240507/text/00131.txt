1 Q. Did you go into the bungalow to meet with Mr. Trump?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And tell us a little bit about what you discussed with
4 him in the bungalow?
5 A. Same sort of thing. He was busy. He was on the phone.
6 When I got there, there were several phone calls. He was
7 watching television. I said, you know, what are we having for
8 dinner? He was watching a documentary. We were talking about
9 the documentary that he was watching about some sailors that got
10 killed by sharks or submarines. He kept trying to make sexual
11 advances, putting his hand on my leg, scooting closer, giving me
12 compliments.
13 Q. What was your response?
14 A. I told him I was on my period.
15 Q. But you told him you did not want to; is that right?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Was there more discussion about the The Apprentice?
18 A. Yes. But a lot less than I thought there would be, no
19 real update.
20 Q. And about how long did you stay?
21 A. Two hours, tops. More than an hour, less than two.
22 Q. And what did he say when you were leaving, when you
23 decided to go?
24 A. "Want to get together again? I missed you." You know,
25 the usual.

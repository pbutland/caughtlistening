1            Your Honor, there are a couple of different
2   reasons, but what's clear is that the Court set guardrails
3   for this testimony.

14   alleged incident back in 2006, a lot of the testimony that

21            There was testimony today about being blacked out;
22   about not wearing a condom, which was after there was
23   testimony from the -- from her employer that you had to wear
24   a condom; that there was always -- that there was always a
25   condom worn; the height of the two individuals; the fact

1   her, and I never went to California.
2            She said, I will pay for your trip.  I am so scared.
3   So I went with her.  I was an extra, like a completely clothed
4   background extra, in a bar on her shoots.
5            And the director, who is a very famous director, from
6   a famous adult company, Wicked Pictures, saw me, and said he
7   actually thought I was already an adult actress and asked me if
8   I would be in another movie.
9            I honestly was kind of scared to do it.  And she said,
10   I will do it with you, and just doing one you can say you have
11   done it, and it bumps you up in pay grade.
12            So I said, yes.  And I will cut out a lot of the other
13   details, and five days later she got on a plane to fly back
14   home, and I got offered a contract at Wicked Pictures.
15       Q    And how old were you at the time?
16       A    Twenty-three.
17       Q    Did there come a time that you started writing for
18   adult films?
19       A    Yes, about six months later.
20       Q    Were you still about 23-years old?
21       A    I was 23, yes.
22       Q    Do you continue to write for adult films?
23       A    Yes, I still do.
24       Q    And did there come a time when you started directing
25   in that industry?

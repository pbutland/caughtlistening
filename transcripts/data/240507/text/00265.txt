1       Q.   Now, in 2016, you say that you were afraid, but the
2   story was worth a lot of money for you now; right?
3       A.   Correct.
4       Q.   And you then had Gina Rodriguez go out and try to sell
5   the story; right?
6       A.   Correct.  I didn't care for how much.  I just wanted
7   the story out there, which is why I had a press conference set
8   up for free.
9       Q.   And you didn't give a free press conference; did you?
10       A.   I didn't have to.
11       Q.   You were looking to get -- extort money from President
12   Trump; right?
13       A.   False.
14       Q.   Well, that's what you did; right?
15       A.   False.
16       Q.   And just when we're talking about your fear, the fear,
17   your supposed fear that you supposedly felt is totally based on
18   the supposed incident that took place in 2011 that you never
19   told anybody about; right?
20       A.   I am really sorry, I can't always hear when you step
21   away.  I am so sorry.
22       Q.   When you say this fear that you say you were under in
23   2016 is based on the supposed incident that supposedly took
24   place five years earlier, that you still hadn't told anybody
25   publicly about; right?

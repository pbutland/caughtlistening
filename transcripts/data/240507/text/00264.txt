S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2770
1       Q.   Now, in 2016, you claim you have been threatened and
2   you were afraid for your life; right?
3       A.   Yes.
4       Q.   But at that point -- and were you afraid for your life,
5   you had been told, "Don't talk any more about Trump otherwise
6   your life and your baby's life will be in danger;" right?
7       A.   Correct.
8       Q.   And so you decided, well, I'm going to sell my story;
9   right?
10       A.   I didn't just decide that, I was given advice from
11   someone to do so.
12       Q.   You were given advice, according to you, that instead
13   of staying quiet because your life was threatened, instead, the
14   best thing to do was to go out and sell your story; right?
15       A.   Yes.  I was very different and a much braver person in
16   2016 than I was in 2011.  Because Donald Trump was not just a
17   guy on television, he was running for President, I was more
18   afraid for my situation.  The attorney told me:  Get high, stay
19   light, get out in front where you are safe, hide in plain view.
20       Q.   In 2011, your story wasn't worth much money?
21       A.   I don't know what it was worth.  I turned down many
22   offers.
23       Q.   You turned down or tried to get $15,000.  You couldn't
24   get that?
25       A.   Correct.

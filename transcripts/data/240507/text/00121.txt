S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger
2627
1       A.   I wrote it down on a piece of paper next to my bed and
2   I entered it into the phone.
3       Q.   When you say you "entered it into your phone," did you
4   put it into your phone contacts?
5       A.   Yes.  Sorry.
6       Q.   That's all right.
7                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we show now just to the
8        witness to the Court and the parties People's Exhibit 228A
9        for identification.
10       Q.   Do you recognize that, Ms. Daniels?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   What do you recognize that to be?
13       A.   That is a picture of Rhona's contact in my phone.
14       Q.   And do you notice that the phone number is redacted to
15   show only the last four digits of the number?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   Had you reviewed it and compared it to the original
18   contact without that redaction?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Are they exactly the same other than the redaction?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Other than the redaction, is that an exact copy of the
23   contact that you entered into your phone for Rhona when you
24   received it from Mr. Trump sometime in 2006?
25       A.   Yes, it is.

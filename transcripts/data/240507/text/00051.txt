1       were threatened by some random man in a parking lot and
2       that's why she didn't tell her story earlier.
3                And there is no connection at all to -- I don't
4       believe her story -- but there is also just no connection to
5       President Trump in any way on this, and so we would ask that
6       that be precluded.
7                MS. HOFFINGER:  We are not suggesting that it was
8       President Trump who did that.
9                There are a few things that I would say.
10                First of all, the defense opened the door in their
11       cross-examination of Keith Davidson.
12                They put in the clip saying that Avenatti said
13       something about her story of being threatened in a parking
14       lot in 2011 by a man as being not true.
15                It is also the basis of a defamation claim, which
16       the defense opened the door to on their opening when they
17       said that this is all just about the fact that she owes him
18       some legal fees having to do with that case.
19                So they've opened the door.
20                It also goes to, your Honor, directly to why she
21       didn't tell her story at various times.  So it's a critical
22       piece.
23                They've opened the door to it.  And we should be
24       allowed to elicit it.
25                THE COURT:  The latter issue that you say they did

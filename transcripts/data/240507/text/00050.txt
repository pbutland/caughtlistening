Proceedings
2556
1       the Prosecutor wasn't going there, so it's not drawing the
2       sting out of -- they are putting in very prejudicial
3       material, and they are not drawing the sting out, they are
4       essentially making this into rape, which is totally
5       improper, that she felt threatened and --
6                MS. HOFFINGER:  Let me make this clear --
7                MS. NECHELES:  And that she felt threatened into
8       doing it.
9                MS. HOFFINGER:  Let me make this clear.  She has
10       always said, and she did not say -- she will not say that,
11       she will not say that this is a sexual assault, that will
12       not be her account, has not been her account and never has
13       been.
14                So to the extent that that is the way that the
15       defense is characterizing that, I will make that clear and
16       she will make that clear.
17                MS. NECHELES:  Judge, there is, additionally,
18       another area that I don't know whether the prosecutors
19       intend to go into, but I would ask that she be precluded
20       from being asked.
21                She has said on various occasions, starting in
22       2018, that she and her daughter were threatened by some
23       random man.
24                THE COURT:  That she?
25                MS. NECHELES:  That she and her daughter's lives

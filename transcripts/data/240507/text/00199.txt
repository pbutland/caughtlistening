S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger
2705
1       Q    Was it your understanding that the Court in California
2   actually found that you were the prevailing party in that
3   suit to free you from the NDA and, therefore, awarded you legal
4   fees?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And were those legal fees -- did they total
7   approximately a little under a hundred thousand dollars?
8       A    Yes, just under a hundred grand.
9       Q    And after you were free from that NDA, as a result of
10   what we just discussed, did you publish a book?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    What was the name of that book?
13       A    "Full Disclosure."
14       Q    And what is that book about?
15       A    It's mostly about my life.  It starts when I'm two
16   years old, actually, all the way up until, I believe, I think it
17   ends in June of 2018.
18       Q    And did you include in the book some descriptions of
19   what happened with Mr. Trump?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Did you include in that book every detail of what
22   occurred in the room with Mr. Trump in his hotel, Harrah's?
23       A    Not every detail, no.
24       Q    Does the book also include some difficult experiences
25   that you had as a child?

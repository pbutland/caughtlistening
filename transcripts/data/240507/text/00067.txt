1       Q    So just to clarify, so was the platform that you were
2   interested in running on was to promote sex education and
3   women's reproductive rights?
4       A    Correct.
5       Q    And if you had run, you would be running as a
6   Republican, correct?
7       A    Correct.
8       Q    I would like now to direct your attention to July of
9   2006.
10            Were you working at a celebrity golf tournament in
11   Lake Tahoe at that time?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    And for whom were you working at the time?
14       A    I was still under contract with Wicked Pictures, the
15   adult film company.
16       Q    Contract, meaning you were both a director and a
17   writer and also an actress?
18       A    Yes, ma'am.
19       Q    And what were you and others from Wicked Entertainment
20   doing at this golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July of 2006?
21       A    So, Wicked sponsors one of the holes on the golf
22   course, which, yes, I know it's very funny.  We are an adult
23   film company sponsoring one of the holes.
24            And we had a table in the gift room where celebrities
25   would come through, get a gift bag, check out the products,

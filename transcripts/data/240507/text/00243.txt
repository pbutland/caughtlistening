S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2749
1       Q    And you told Gloria Allred that you did not have sex
2   with President Trump; didn't you?
3       A    No. I did not say that. I told her that I did.
4       Q    I want to direct your attention to Page 194 of Exhibit
5   J-11G, which we'll show just to the parties and the witness.
6                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
7        and the parties' screens.)
8       Q    Okay.
9                 MS. NECHELES:  If we could blow up for the
10        witness where it starts with "I barreled", that paragraph.
11       Q    You see that?
12       You can read it to yourself where it starts off with "I
13   barreled".
14       Am I correct that you told -- you had a conversation, and
15   you said in a prior statement that you gave Gloria Allred an
16   extremely abbreviated version of your interactions, leaving out
17   sex; right?
18       A    Yes. During that phone conversation.
19       When I met her in person later, I told her everything.
20       Q    All right.
21       I'm talking about what you wrote in your book.
22       This is your book; right?
23                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
24                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
25       Q    This is your book; right?

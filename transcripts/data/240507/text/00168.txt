1 because she's an opportunist, out to make money and that she

4 the defamation case.
5 Second, they specifically put in an exhibit which
6 was admitted in evidence, through Keith Davidson's
7 testimony, where they referenced this threat in 2011, saying
8 that it was not true.
9 And, so, it was incumbent upon us to bring out
10 those details in her direct, again, to rehabilitate
11 credibility where they attacked it both during Keith
12 Davidson's testimony and on opening.
13 So, your Honor, we were extremely mindful of not
14 eliciting too much testimony about the actual act.
15 We did it initially before your Honor even asked us
16 to carve it back.
17 Additionally, so there were details that were left
18 out based on the Court's instructions at the bench.
19 They were additional details that were not brought
20 out.
21 But, your Honor, this —— stating that this is an
22 entirely new story is not accurate.
23 And I'm certain that when they cross—examine
24 Ms. Daniels, some of this will come out, and some of this
25 will come out on redirect.

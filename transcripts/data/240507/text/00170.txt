Proceedings
2676
1 don't think there is any basis for a mistrial, your Honor.
2 THE COURT: Thank you.
3 MR. BLANCHE: Just briefly, your Honor. That
4 misses the point a little bit of our argument.
5 The point of the argument is that the reason why
6 this evidence, in theory, is admissible, over our objection,
7 is because this is —— these, in theory, are the facts which
8 was presented to Mr. Davidson and Mr. Cohen so that they
9 could evaluate whether they could enter into an NDA and,
10 supposedly, the fact and the details that were going to be
11 kept from the American people in 2016.
12 That's the theory for this evidence coming in.
13 The problem is that isn't what came in.
14 And so what —— instead, what came in is this
15 extraordinarily prejudicial testimony that has changed over
16 time.
17 And we can't fix that except to cross—examine her,
18 but it's still —— it has nothing to do with the case.
19 The voters decided in 2016. The People are going
20 to make a lot of that in their summation, I expect.
21 And, Judge, I don't think anybody, anybody can
22 listen to what that witness said and think that that has
23 anything to do with the charged conduct.
24 And it's the kind of testimony that's so
25 prejudicial that you have to run —— you run the very high

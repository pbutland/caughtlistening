1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And in your book, you said that you left out sex and
3   anything in the least bit interesting; right?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    And then Ms. Allred asked you, "Is there anything
6   else?"; right?
7       A    (No response).
8       Q    Right?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And you said, "No;" right?
11       A    Right.
12       Q    And then she said, "Well, I can't do anything else for
13   you if that's all there is;" right?
14       A    Correct.
15       Q    And, you say -- you wrote: "I hung up, and that was
16   that;" right?
17       A    Correct.
18       I did not tell her all the sex details. I did not trust
19   her.
20       And she wanted me to accuse him of forced -- basically
21   rape, and so I did not continue that conversation.
22       Q    None of that is in your book; is it?
23       A    No.
24       Q    Right?
25       You're making this up as you sit there; right?

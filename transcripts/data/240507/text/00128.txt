7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And did you have a discussion in there with Mr. Trump?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And, just generally, what was the discussion?
11 A. It was very brief. He was very busy. People were in
12 and out. He introduced me to a couple of other people when I
13 was there, and he was in a meeting with somebody when I got
14 there. Then he had another meeting come in. It was a gentlemen
15 with an accent. It was very sort of rushed.
16 At one point he did step out and leave us in the
17 office. We took selfies. He said: "I don't have a lot of
18 time. I wanted you to stop by. I wanted to say hi."
19 It was always: "I am still working on the The
20 Apprentice thing," it got pushed back, I got it; that kind of
21 thing. It was always very, very brief.
22 Q. Did he also end up inviting you to another event?
23 A. He invited —— well, okay. My assistant loved beauty
24 pageants. He was sort of in the midst of dealing with his
25 upcoming pageant. He offered us tickets, if we wanted to go.

1 as I stared at myself in the mirror.
2 Q. You were shaking still, but less now, correct?
3 A. Correct.
4 Q. You didn't say, "I was lying and the instructor saw me
5 crying;" did you?
6 A. Yes, I did. I said, she had a blowout, that is a lie.
7 That is not telling the truth.
8 Q. Then, in fact, in the same book, you said that, "I went
9 and did the class, told no one what happened in the parking
10 lot;" right?
11 A. Yes. I went to the class afterwards. Everybody was
12 gone. Told my instructor that she had an accident and that was
13 it.
14 Q. When you wrote, "I went and did the class," you didn't
15 mean to say, "I did the exercise class?"
16 A. It was incorrect. I did not do the class.
17 Q. So you wrote a book saying that you did the class and
18 now you are saying you didn't do the class?
19 A. I did not do the class. There is no way I could have
20 possibly done exercises as scared as I was.
21 Q. In any case, you didn't tell anybody in the class about
22 it; right?
23 A. No, but I wasn't close with those women anyway.
24 Q. You didn't call the police, did you?
25 A. No.

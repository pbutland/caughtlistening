1       Q    Did he say anything else about The Apprentice and what
2   might happen if you went on?
3       A    Right.
4            And so, I was -- first of all, there is no way that's
5   going to happen.  I knew enough about his ego to know even you
6   don't have that much power, thinking that would also make him
7   want to do it.
8            I was like, people underestimate women, especially
9   people in the adult industry, when they see blond hair and big
10   boobs, and I am a good writer and director.
11            And he said, this is your chance to have somebody see
12   that part of you.
13            I was like, well, but I am not a business person.  I
14   don't have that kind of education.  Like, there is no way I
15   could win.  What, if, you know --
16            He said, you don't have to win.  You just have to show
17   who you are.
18            I said, what if I lose on the first episode?  That
19   also makes me look bad.  People will take that and run with it.
20   You are just an idiot like we all thought you were.
21            And then he said, what if I tell you what the
22   challenges are?
23       Q    What did you understand that to mean?
24       A    He said, you know, we can kind of like on the
25   wrestling thing, if you know what they are, obviously, I can't

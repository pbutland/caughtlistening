5. Franklin — Redirect/Mangold
2550
1 Exhibit 414G, already in evidence.
2 (Displayed.)
3 Q Can you describe what this is?
4 A The acknowledgments for "Think Like a Billionaire."
5 Q And can you read the first sentence of this to the
6 jury, please?
7 A "Like my previous book, 'How To Get Rich,’ this book
8 never would have happened without the hard work and help of
9 Meredith McIver. Also, Norma Foerderer, who manages my
10 schedule, kept this project on schedule."
11 Q And, again, is this consistent with your understanding
12 of how authors and ghost writers work together?
13 A Yes.
14 Q And then can you read to yourself the next paragraph,
15 please.
16 A To myself?
17 Q Yeah, just to yourself. You don't need to read the
18 whole thing.
19 (Pause.)
20 A Got it.
21 Q Like the acknowledgment section of the prior book, does
22 this section of the acknowledgments of this book also list
23 employees of Penguin Random House?
24 A It does.
25 Q And is it the author's —— withdrawn.

Senior Court Reporter

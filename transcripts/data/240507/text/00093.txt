1   conversations except that it wasn't weird, it was like business
2   questions and thought-out questions and thought-out answers,
3   and how did you come up with ideas for my scripts and things
4   like that.
5            And it was at that point he got really quiet, and he
6   was thinking, and he told me he had an idea, that I should go
7   on his television show.
8       Q    Which show?
9       A    The Apprentice.
10       Q    Was it The Apprentice?
11       A    I don't remember the TV show.  The Apprentice, I
12   assume it's Celebrity Apprentice.  I don't know, The
13   Apprentice.
14            And I said there is no way that they would ever let --
15   there is no way NBC would ever let an adult actress on
16   television.  And I said, even you don't have that much power.
17            And he said that he did.
18            He said, you remind me of my daughter because she is
19   smart and blond and beautiful and people under estimate her as
20   well.  And the way he framed it did actually make perfect
21   sense, because he is all about like PR things, the spin.  And
22   he was like, that will really shake things up, and you can go
23   on the show and prove that you are not just a dumb bimbo, you
24   are more than people think and he would get a lot of attention
25   for having this crazy idea.

S. Daniels — Direct/Hoffinger
2619
I THE COURT: Please approach.
2 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
3 THE COURT: Your objection is to leading?
4 MS. NECHELES: The objection to leading, but I
5 am also objecting to the witness just going off on
6 tangents.
7 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger is doing some leading.
8 I will sustain your objection as to leading.
9 But I think that is what Ms. Hoffinger is trying
10 to do, she is trying to direct her. I think that might be
11 the safer course.
12 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I understand that. The
13 problem is, that she is also leading her through a set of
14 things: What do you remember?
15 And, so —— and obviously the problem with leading,
16 it suggests answers sometimes.
17 So I understand that —— maybe if your Honor could
I8 direct the witness to just answer the questions.
19 MS. HOFFINGER: I think that she has answered my
20 questions. I think asking her to answer my questions is
21 not necessarily probative.
22 But I would say, I have been leading her to try to
23 be cognizant of the Judge's decision. I have had a
24 chance to talk to her about it. I was trying to lead her.
25 Second, Ms. Necheles has made very clear her story

S. Daniels — Cross/Necheles
2720
1 Is it correct that you had mock cross—examination done?
2 A I was asked questions as they would, perhaps, be asked
3 by the Court.
4 Q But, you said on a previous occasion that you had
5 "mock cross—examination" done to you ——
6 A I used the wrong word. "Mock" is not the correct term
7 now that I’m in court.
8 Q So, when you said that before, you were not being
9 truthful?
10 A I was incorrect. I did not know what true court would
11 be like.
12 Q But, they asked you questions as if you were being
13 cross—examined; right?
14 A Not exactly, no.
15 Q And it was, you said, "brutal sessions", right,
16 "grueling sessions", right?
17 A True.
18 Q And they were "pushing you"; right?
19 A The memories were hard to bring up, yes. They were
20 painful.
21 Q And they wanted to make sure that when you came into
22 court, you were able to present a good appearance; right?
23 A The —— that I wouldn't be too upset.
24 Q And that you would be ready for cross—exam; right?
25 A No. I don’t think so.

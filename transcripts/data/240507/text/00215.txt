1       Q    Okay.
2       So, when you said "mock cross-examinations", it wasn't to
3   get you ready for cross-exam?
4       A    (No response).
5       Q    Right? Is that what you're saying?
6       A    It was to have all of the facts. They wanted to ask,
7   to have as much information as possible.
8       Q    And the prosecutors began your direct testimony today
9   by asking you why you started acting in pornography; right?
10       Do you remember that happening this morning?
11       A    They asked me why?
12       Q    Yes.
13       A    I don't think they asked me why.
14       Q    Well, do you recall testifying that you started acting
15   in pornography because you wanted to make more money; right?
16       A    Correct.
17       Q    And it's that simple, you wanted more money; right?
18       A    Don't we all want to make more money in our jobs?
19       Q    And that is why you started acting in pornography;
20   right?
21       A    To get a pay increase for my dancing, yes.
22       Q    That motivates you a lot in life, making more money;
23   right?
24       A    Well, it is the United -- that's what we do here.
25   (Shrugs).

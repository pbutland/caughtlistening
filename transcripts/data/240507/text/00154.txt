S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger
2660
1       Q    What do you mean by that?
2       Were there actual names disclosed in the NDA?
3       A    No.
4       In the original paperwork, instead of saying "Stormy
5   Daniels" or "Stephanie Clifford", it identified me as one party
6   and Mr. Trump as the other party. They gave us, like, fake
7   names, pseudonyms of "Peggy" and "David". I think it was
8   "David".
9       Q    "David Dennison"?
10       A    Yeah.
11       This was the Side Letter that went to it, that identified
12   that I was "Peggy" and he was "David".
13                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we just take a quick look at
14        Page 3 on the PDF, of the signature line.
15                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
16       Q    Is that your signature there on the line for "Peggy
17   Peterson a/k/a Stephanie Gregory Clifford a/k/a Stormy
18   Daniels"?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And how did you sign it?
21       A    Stephanie Clifford.
22       What do you mean?
23       Q    What's the date that you signed it?
24       A    Oh. 10/10/16.
25       Q    And you signed it with your name as "Peggy Peterson";

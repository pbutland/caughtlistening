S. Daniels — Cross/Necheles
2751
1 A No.
2 Q Well, you wrote a whole book, and you specifically
3 describe that encounter, and you didn't say anything like you
4 just said; right?
5 A Which is why I said it’s an abbreviated version of my
6 interaction, leaving out the sex part.
7 I'm pretty sure that backs up my story.
8 Q You said it’s an abbreviated version of your
9 interaction with Donald Trump; right?
10 A "Abbreviated" means I left out all of the details,
11 including the sex, because she wanted to force me into saying
12 things that were not true.
13 Q Meaning, you didn’t tell Gloria Allred anything about
14 sex; right?
15 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
16 THE COURT: Sustained.
17 Q You learned from that, did you not, that a story about
18 President Trump that doesn’t include sex will make you no
19 money; right?
20 A It taught me that I should tell the truth and not
21 trust people that I didn’t feel like I could trust, and she was
22 one of them.
23 Q In other words, it taught you that if you want to make
24 money off of President Trump, you better talk about sex; right?
25 A No.

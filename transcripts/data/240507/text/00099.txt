S. Daniels — Direct/Hoffinger
2605
1 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
2 THE COURT: Please approach.
3 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
4 record.)
5 THE COURT: I understand that your client is
6 upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is
7 shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous.
8 It has the potential to intimidate the witness
9 and the jury can see that.
10 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him.
11 THE COURT: So, I am speaking to you here at the
12 bench because I don’t want to embarrass him.
13 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him.
14 THE COURT: You need to speak to him. I won’t
15 tolerate that.
16 MR. BLANCHE: I will talk to him.
17 THE COURT: One time I noticed when Ms. Daniels
18 was testifying about rolling up the magazine, and
19 presumably smacking your client, and after that point he
20 shook his head and he looked down.
21 And, later, I think he was looking at you,
22 Mr. Blanche, later when we were talking about The
23 Apprentice, at that point he again uttered a vulgarity and
24 looked at you this time.
25 Please talk to him at the break.

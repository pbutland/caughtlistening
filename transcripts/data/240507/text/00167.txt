1   account -- her account completes the narrative of the events
2   that precipitated the falsification of business records.
3         And this story, your Honor, her account is highly
4   probative of the defendant's intent, his intent and his
5   motive in paying this off, and making sure that the American
6   public did not hear this before the election.
7            It is precisely what the defendant did not want to
8   become public.
9            I will say, without getting into too many details,
10   that Mr. Blanche's recitation of the fact that this is
11   entirely new is not true.
12            I will say that, and I'm sure that he knows this,
13   that the account and things like the fact that a condom was
14   not used has been out there for a very, very long time.
15             This is not new.
16            This is not a new account.
17            Now, there were certain details that I told your
18   Honor that she remembered after a movie in 2019, and I was
19   going to elicit that.
20            You asked me not to, and I did not.
21            But, you know, the other thing is, Judge, they
22   opened the door to this.
23            So, the 2011 threat to her was opened on not only
24   in their opening when they talked about legal fees and that
25   she was changing -- you know, coming up with this story,

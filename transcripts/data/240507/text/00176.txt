1 Ms. Daniels regarding a 2011 incident in which she testified
2 about being threatened in a parking lot.
3 This testimony was permitted to explain any impact

9 inference that Mr. Trump was behind any such threats, nor
10 may you draw any inference unfavorable to the defendant as a

13 that Mr. Trump had nothing to do with any threat to this
14 witness, and you may not draw any inference unfavorable to
15 the defendant as a result of this testimony.

18 going too quick, honestly.
19 We haven't really had time to think about it.
20 THE COURT: Do you want to think about it?
21 MS. NECHELES: Yes. Because even hearing it, it
22 sounds like your Honor is saying, yeah, this actually
23 happened and we contest it. We're going to have to cross on
24 this.
25 THE COURT: Okay. You can think about it and get

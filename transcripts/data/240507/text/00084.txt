1 And then a —— like another little room that had a
2 table and chairs. It was almost a full—size dining room table
3 with a full—size —— some people call it a buffet, some people
4 call it a credenza, depending on where you are from.
5 It was all heavy, beautiful furniture. There was
6 another room over that way —— I didn’t go into that room. It
7 was a very big beautiful room. It was nicer than any of my
8 friends’ apartments.
9 Q When Mr. Trump came back in the suit —— you said he
10 went to put on a dress shirt. Where did the two of you go at
11 that point?
12 A To the table, I guess the dining room table. The
13 table with the chairs would be where you would have dinner.
14 Q Did you both sit down at that dining room table?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Where was he sitting and where were you sitting?
17 A He was sitting across from me with his back against
18 the wall, and the buffet/credenza was behind him. And I was
19 sitting directly across from him in the main area, the living
20 room bar area, behind me.
21 Q And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say about talking
22 a while before dinner?
23 A It was a little bit early. I do remember it wasn’t
24 even dark outside just yet. It was still some light coming
25 through the windows.

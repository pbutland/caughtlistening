Proceedings

1 This is the account that would have been told to
2 the American people had she not entered into the NDA.
3 She entered into the NDA willingly, but had she not
4 entered into the NDA, this is what would have been told to
5 the American people. And that's why they wanted to pay her
6 to remain silent.
7 MS. NECHELES: Judge, it's not the account that
8 would have been told.
9 Her story has changed over time.
10 And if they go into this, we will have to go into
11 how her story has changed.
12 This is all a fabrication.
13 MS. HOFFINGER: This is not new. This is not a
14 fabrication nor has her story changed.
15 I think we will be able to establish, if the
16 defense goes into this —— they are saying that this is a new
17 fabrication. There are prior consistent statements and so I
18 image we will it deal with that at that time.
19 THE COURT: To the extent that it helps to explain
20 that she had forgotten some things and she remembered
21 certain other things, I will allow it.
22 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay.
23 THE COURT: To the extent that it goes into how she
24 felt when she got into the bed and feelings while lying
25 there, I think we should wait and see what happens on

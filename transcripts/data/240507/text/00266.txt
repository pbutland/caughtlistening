1       A.   It was not a supposed incident.  It was a true
2   incident.  I had told a lot of people.
3       Q.   You hadn't told your husband; right?
4       A.   No.
5       Q.   And then, so, because you had that fear, you decided to
6   do exactly the opposite of what that person had told to you do;
7   right?
8       A.   Which person?
9       Q.   That supposed guy who showed up in that parking lot?
10       A.   Correct.
11       Q.   So you weren't really very scared; were you?
12       A.   I was terrified.  I decided to change my tactic.  It
13   was a new ball game.  There is a big difference between a
14   reality TV star and someone running for office.
15       Q.   The truth is, you saw your opportunity to make it
16   known, you had Gina Rodriguez try to sell your story to the
17   National Enquirer?
18       A.   I saw my opportunity to get the story out.  I didn't
19   put a price tag on it.  That is why I did every interview for
20   free.
21       Q.   You didn't do any interviews for free at that point?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   And I want to show you what is in evidence as People's
24   Exhibit 117A, which are texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan
25   Howard of the National Enquirer.

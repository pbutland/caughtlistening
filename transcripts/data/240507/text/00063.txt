1 A Yes. I directed my first adult film, it was a
2 feature, which is —— there are two kinds of films. One that is
3 like not scripted and you are just sort of like seen. There is
4 no thinking or you don't have to learn dialogue or whatever.
5 And then there are adult features that are very
6 scripted, kind of the ones if you cut out the really naughty
7 stuff, you will see on TV late at night. They are, basically,
8 actual movies that have sex.
9 That's what the company I wrote for did.
10 I was one of the youngest, if not the youngest, adult
11 feature director and definitely the youngest female feature
12 director. I started directing when I was 23, and I have
13 directed over 150 films, and I have won 11 best director awards
14 and two best screenplays.
15 Q And have you also acted in what we would call
16 mainstream movies?
17 A Yes.
18 Q Could you give the jury examples of those you did?
19 A Sure. I was in a movie called 40—Year—Old Virgin,
20 Knocked Up, Finding Bliss, a whole bunch.
21 I have been in TV shows too.
22 Q I will just ask you to slow down a little bit.
23 A I was in a television show called The Dirt with
24 Courteney Cox, Superbad.
25 Q And have you also acted in some music videos?

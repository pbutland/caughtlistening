1   number or from Keith's number and/or Rhona's number, I guess,
2   and said he was going to be in L.A, he had the final information
3   almost all sorted out for the show; would I meet him again for
4   dinner at his bungalow, the Beverly Hills Hotel.
5       Q.   Did you end up going to the bungalow?
6       A.   I did.
7       Q.   And how did you get there?
8       A.   Mike, who was previously my publicist, we were now
9   dating, he drove me in my car.
10       Q.   And had you told your boyfriend at that time about what
11   exactly had happened in the hotel room with Mr. Trump?
12       A.   Not the sexual part.
13       Q.   Why not?
14       A.   Because I was ashamed.
15       Q.   Why did you decide to go meet him at the bungalow?
16       A.   To speak.  Mike did know about The Apprentice thing.
17   If I suddenly didn't want to do it, it would be very weird.
18       Q.   Did you meet anyone outside?
19            How did you get into his bungalow?
20       A.   He gave me specific instructions.  The place is kind of
21   complicated to pull up to.  His bodyguard, Keith, met me at my
22   car, and Mike stayed in the car.  He escorted me through like
23   these back patios to his particular building.
24       Q.   Did you ask your boyfriend to just wait for you?
25       A.   It was pretty common.

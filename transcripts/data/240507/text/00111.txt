1   fantastic together.  I want to get you on the show."  And that
2   was it.  He didn't give me anything.  He didn't offer to pay me
3   or anything or a cell phone number or anything like that.
4       Q.   Did he ask you to keep your encounter with him
5   confidential?
6       A.   No.
7       Q.   Did he express any concern at that point about his wife
8   finding out?
9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Did you end up having dinner in his room that night?
11       A.   No.
12       Q.   You said it was dark out when you left?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   And do you recall how you got back to your hotel?
15       A.   It was a cab.
16       Q.   After that night, did you tell anybody else about what
17   happened?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Just give us a sense of the people that you told and
20   what you told them?
21       A.   I told very few people that we had actually had sex
22   because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say
23   no.  A lot of people would just assume -- they would make jokes
24   out of it.  I didn't think it was funny.  I didn't want to hear
25   about it, or assume that I was paid prostitute, which I wasn't.

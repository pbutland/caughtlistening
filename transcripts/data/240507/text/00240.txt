1 My question was, you’ve been making money by claiming to
2 have had sex with President Trump for more than a decade;
3 right?
4 A I have been making money by telling my story about
5 what happened to me.
6 Q And that story, in essence, is that you say you had
7 sex with President Trump; right?
8 A Yes.
9 Q And that story has made you a lot of money; right?
10 A It has also cost me a lot of money.
11 Q Now, just going back, isn’t it a fact that before you
12 started making money off of claiming you had sex, you were
13 denying that you had sex with President Trump; right?
14 A Because of the NDA, yes.
15 Q The NDA was signed in 2016; right?
16 A Yes.
17 Q Isn’t it a fact that in 2011, you spoke with a
18 prominent lawyer named Gloria Allred about whether you could
19 sue President Trump for money; right?
20 A I don’t remember what was talked about in that
21 conversation.
22 But I also told her that I had sex with Donald Trump.
23 Q You claim you told her you had sex with Donald Trump;
24 is that what you’re saying?
25 A Yes.

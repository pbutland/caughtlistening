2   CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
3   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
4       Q    So, you started making some money then in high school,
5   is that right?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And did you move out of your mother's house at some
8   point?
9       A    Yes, ma'am.
10       Q    During or shortly after high school?
11       A    When I was 17.
12       Q    And just briefly, why did you move out of your
13   mother's house, just briefly?
14       A    My mother was very neglectful.  She would disappear
15   for days at a time.  I wish I could say that she was an addict
16   of some sort, that would kind of be an excuse, but to this day
17   I really don't know.  We lived in a really bad neighborhood,
18   and she would just vanish.
19            And so, finally, it came to a head right around
20   Christmastime of my senior year.  And my -- and then I left for
21   a little bit for a couple of weeks.  And then I came home.  And
22   since I was 17, which in Louisiana at that time you are
23   considered an adult, so I moved out.
24       Q    And have you supported yourself ever since?
25       A    Yes.

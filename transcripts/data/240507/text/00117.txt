1 A. He introduced me as his little friend Stormy to Big
2 Ben, the football player, and we sat down. I remember it
3 clearly because I talked Ben into letting me try on his
4 Superbowl ring and two of my fingers fit into it.
5 Q. When you say "Big Ben," is that how Mr. Trump referred
6 to Mr. Roethlisberger?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. What, if anything, did you discuss at the table with
9 Mr. Trump or Mr. Roethlisberger?
10 A. It was really loud. I mean, it was very, very brief.
11 They were talking. I think they had been having a conversation
12 when I arrived. They kind of continued it out of earshot. They
13 were whispering to each other.
14 Then he said —— he did come back to me: Hey,
15 everything about our idea, I think it's good. I got to get back
16 home and figure out how to get you on the show.
17 He took a call. He was very busy.
18 He left and said: "You know, I am going to have Ben
19 walk you back to your room," and, "Ben, would you mind seeing
20 her up?"
21 It was very, very short. Maybe ten minutes that I was
22 there.
23 Q. And Ben walked you up to your room?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Did you leave Lake Tahoe the next day?

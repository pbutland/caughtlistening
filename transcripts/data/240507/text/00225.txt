S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2731
1   ordered you to pay money; right?
2       A    Roughly, yes.
3       Q    And that was you saying: I don't care about a Federal
4   Court Order; right?
5       A    That is me saying that I will not pay for telling the
6   truth.
7       Q    Well, it was a Federal Court Order, you understood;
8   right?
9                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection. Asked and answered.
10                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
11                 You can answer.
12       A    That's not what I was responding to.
13       Q    Well --
14       A    My motivation was because I was telling the truth.
15       Q    Ms. Daniels, you understand that there's no question
16   standing; right?
17                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
18                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
19                 MS. NECHELES:  You're correct.
20                 Can you ask the witness to respond?
21                 THE COURT:  Sure.
22                 Please wait until there's a question, and then
23        you can answer the question.
24                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.
25       Q    But, you don't care about the Court Order; do you?

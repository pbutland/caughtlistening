1 And I was in the Baton Rouge Ballet Company.
2 Q And I'm going to ask you to slow down just a little bit
3 so that the court reporter can get it all down and also so that
4 the jury can hear you.
5 A I'm sorry.
6 Q It's all right.
7 I'm sorry.
8 Did you do some work during high school, some paperwork?
9 A Yes, I did. I taught handicap rider lessons at the
10 stable where I kept my horse in exchange for board and feed for
11 my horse and riding lessons.
12 And I shoved manure. (Laughter).
13 And then later I went on to dancing.
14 Q Okay. Tell us about the dancing, when you went on to
15 that?
16 A I was 17, I think, and a friend of mine —— I met a
17 friend who told me that she was a dancer.
18 I thought she meant the same kind of dancing that I did,
19 which was ballet and jazz and tap.
20 I was wrong. (Laughter.)
21 She was an exotic dancer and invited me to the club to see
22 her dance; and they didn't bother to check my ID.
23 So I started dancing on the weekends, which was actually
24 kind of cool because I didn't have to miss any classes and could
25 still make more in two nights than I did shoveling manure eight

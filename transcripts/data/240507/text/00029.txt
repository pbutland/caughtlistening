2       A    One of our goals is selling copies of the book.  But --
3   but our authors are -- I mean, our goal is to make the authors
4   happy also.  But, yes, we definitely want to sell copies of our
5   book.
6       Q    Your goal is to make the authors happy, or what do you
7   mean?
8       A    If they have approval over the cover, we consider that,
9   we consider that.
10       We also want to sell the book.
11       Q    Sure.  And because you are trying to make money off the
12   book; correct?
13       A    That is correct.
14       Q    And so -- and for this book, which is "How To Get
15   Rich," that book, it was about 320 pages; correct?
16   Approximately?
17       A    I would have to double-check it.
18       Q    Are you looking at it now?
19       A    I can look at it.
20       Yes, it is approximately 320 pages.
21       Q    And you were just shown redacted versions of five of
22   those pages, correct, and asked to read those portions?
23       A    Yes.
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  If we could put up Exhibit 414,

17 THE COURT: So I just want to go back for a second
18 to Ms. Necheles' objection earlier.
19 She referenced her objection to feelings coming
20 out.
21 Did you also refer to feelings, that you wanted to
22 get into the feelings of Ms. Daniels?
23 MS. HOFFINGER: I think she's going to describe a
24 little bit about how she felt at the time, because it
25 corroborates what happened.

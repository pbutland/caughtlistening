S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2762
1       A.   I kept all of it secret from my husband.
2       Q.   Your daughter's life was in jeopardy and you did not
3   tell her father; right?
4       A.   Right.
5       Q.   But when you went on Anderson Cooper and were
6   interviewed, you decided to announce it to the world; right?
7       A.   Correct.
8       Q.   And the reason you told this story in 2018 is, you were
9   using it as an excuse for why you never publicly said before
10   that you had had sex with President Trump; right?
11       A.   I don't understand what you are asking.
12       Q.   Well, you used this supposed threat that happened to
13   you as an excuse to tell people, this is why I didn't talk
14   publicly, I was afraid; right?
15       A.   But I did talk publicly.
16       Q.   Well, when did you give a public interview before
17   2011 -- before 2018?
18       A.   I talked publicly on the speakerphone on set multiple
19   times.  On a radio show in 2007 I told the story.
20       Q.   Okay.
21            Ms. Daniels, I am asking about an interview, not what
22   you supposedly told friends.
23       A.   An interview on the radio show, that was an interview.
24       Q.   When was that?
25       A.   In 2007.

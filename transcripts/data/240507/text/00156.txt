1       Q    Why did you write them in?
2       A    Because I was asked to write down names of people who
3   knew all the details.
4       Q    Those were some of the people that you told?
5       A    Yes.
6                 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we look, also, at Page 15,
7        please, of the Agreement, which is Page 18 in the PDF.

9                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we blow up the signature,
10        please?
11       Q    This is the Non-Disclosure Agreement or the Settlement
12   Agreement; and did you sign it?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    What did you sign it as?
15       A    "Peggy Peterson".
16       Q    And why did you not put your real name there?
17       A    Because I was instructed not to, that we were using
18   pseudonyms.
19       Q    After you signed the Agreement, the Side Letter
20   Agreement, and the Settlement Agreement, otherwise known as a
21   Non-Disclosure Agreement, did Gina Rodriguez, generally, just
22   keep you updated on the progress of the deal?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And did you get paid the $130,000 on October 14, 2016,
25   as was disclosed in that email?

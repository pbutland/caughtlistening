1 toilet actually was and used the bathroom, came out, and was
2 washing my hands and touching up my lipstick. I did notice
3 someone had obviously been using the restroom. There were
4 towels and stuff that was open. There was a leather, or like a
5 leather looking toiletry bag on the counter with products and
6 stuff in it, which, you know ——
7 Q. What do you remember about what was inside?
8 A. I did look. I’m not proud of it. I wondered what is
9 in here. And I noticed the toiletry was —— the items were Old
10 Spice and Pert Plus. I thought that was both amusing and odd.
11 And a manicure set, which was gold, gold tweezers and all gold
12 things.
13 I finished washing my hands and touched my makeup up.
14 Then I walked out of the bathroom.
15 Q. Did you try to call anybody while you were inside the
16 bathroom? Al anaAlina was not answering her phone. In fact, I
17 wish I had a cell phone camera. If I did, I definitely would
18 have taken a picture of that. I even thought, woe, this is
19 crazy.
20 Q. Did you try to call her while you were inside the
21 bathroom?
22 A. I believe so. Her phone was going straight to
23 voicemail. At this point she wanted no part of whatever I had
24 going on.
25 Q. What happened when you left the bathroom?

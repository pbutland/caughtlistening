1       A.   Correct.
2       Q.   And President Trump was running for President of the
3   United States at that point, correct?
4       A.   Correct.
5       Q.   And you had authorized Gina Rodriguez to try to sell
6   your story; right?
7       A.   Correct.
8       Q.   And you wanted to do it through a source; right?
9       A.   Once again, I don't know what this is specifically
10   talking about.  I don't know who Dylan is.  I don't know who
11   Wideeye Communication is.  "She doesn't want to go on record
12   about it but will tell the story through a source," I don't know
13   which specific story.  Is it about sex?  Is it about being
14   threatened?  You want me to comment on something when I don't
15   know the context, that's not fair.
16       Q.   Putting aside the text.
17            I am asking you a question.  My question to you is:
18   In June of 2016, had you authorized Gina David to sell your
19   story under the condition you would tell it through a source?
20       A.   I authorized Gina Rodriguez to shop the story so I
21   could make it public.
22       Q.   One of your conditions was that you were telling it
23   through a source, and the other was that you get $100,000;
24   right?
25       A.   I don't remember that, no.

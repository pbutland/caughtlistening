1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And what were those reasons, generally?
3       A    Ummm, so that my daughter would have an account from
4   her mom's own words of what I had been through and --
5       Q    From the various aspects of your life; right?
6       A    And the reasons why I did the things that I did.
7       Q    Now, did there come a time in April of 2018 that your
8   then-lawyer, Michael Avenatti, also filed a defamation case on
9   your behalf against Donald Trump?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    Did you want him to do that?
12       A    No.
13       Q    Why did you not want him to do that?
14                MS. NECHELES:  Objection.
15                THE COURT:  Overruled.
16                You can answer.
17       A    It just seemed really risky.  And it, it -- it didn't
18   seem like it was something that could be won.  It seemed like a
19   bad choice.  Not worth it, I guess.
20       Q    Was the basis of that defamation claim about what
21   happened --
22       A    Yeah.
23       Q    -- in a parking lot?
24       Before you answer, just wait a minute.
25       Was the basis of that defamation claim -- withdrawn.

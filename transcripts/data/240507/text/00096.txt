1   industry friends?
2            Do you all hate each other?
3            Do you love each other?
4            Do you hook up off camera?
5            I don't want to use the word, hook up.
6            Do you sleep with each other off camera?
7            Do you have any friends here?
8            Well, the girls from Wicked were there.
9            And he said, what about your friends here from Wicked?
10            Of course I shot that down immediately because the
11   whole reason I was having dinner there is because I didn't want
12   to have dinner with one of them.
13       Q    Did you call another colleague of yours during this
14   conversation from Wicked?
15       A    No, I didn't.
16       Q    Not from Wicked.  I apologize.
17            Did you call another friend of yours?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Tell us about that.
20       A    Yes.  I bumped into a friend of mine that was in town.
21   She was actually one of my neighbors as well.  I had no idea
22   that she was in Lake Tahoe.  She was not there for the golf
23   tournament.
24            I literally walked into her while I was walking down
25   the street with another girl from the industry getting a tattoo

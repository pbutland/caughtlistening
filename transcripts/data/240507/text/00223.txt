1       Q    Well, you've chosen to disobey the Court Order; right?
2       A    I have chosen not to make a payment while it's still
3   pending, yes.
4       Q    You have announced publicly that you will never pay
5   President Trump the money that you owe him; right?
6       A    Right.
7       Q    In fact, the day after the Federal Court of Appeals
8   ordered you to pay President Trump $245,000, you tweeted: "I
9   will go to jail before I pay a penny;" correct?
10       A    Correct.
11       Q    And, I show you what has been marked as Exhibit J-7.
12                 MS. NECHELES:  We can just show that to the
13        witness, the parties, and the Court.
14                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
15        and the parties' screens.)
16       Q    You recognize that as your tweet?
17       A    Yep.
18                 MS. NECHELES:  I offer that in evidence.
19                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
20                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
21                 MS. NECHELES:  Prior evidence applies.
22                 THE COURT:  Approach.
23                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
24        at sidebar:)
25                 MS. HOFFINGER:  She's admitted each of these.

1                MS. NECHELES:  Objection.  Leading.
2                THE COURT:  Sustained.
3       Q    What, if anything, did you become aware of in February
4   of 2018 in terms of public statements made by Michael Cohen
5   about this -- these issues?
6       A    Ummm, the articles and the quotes to journalists
7   started to have more details that they wouldn't have gotten
8   unless they got it directly from somebody.  And then I found out
9   that Michael Cohen was --
10                MS. NECHELES:  Objection.
11       A    I found out that he was shopping a book.
12                MS. NECHELES:  Objection to the hearsay.
13                THE COURT:  Sustained.
14       Q    Did you believe that some of what Michael Cohen was
15   saying publicly was not truthful?
16       A    I'm not sure.
17       Q    Well, did you believe that Michael Cohen was making
18   certain assertions about what did or didn't happen between
19   yourself and Mr. Trump?
20       Was he denying that you had an encounter with Mr. Trump?
21       A    No.  He was saying that I did.  And he was -- he was
22   the fixer.
23       Q    Okay.  He was making certain public statements that
24   upset you; is that right?
25       A    Yes.

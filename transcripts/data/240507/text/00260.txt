1       Q.   And you and Michael Avenatti offered a $100,000 reward
2   for anyone who could identify this supposed assailant?
3       A.   Michael Cohen offered -- Michael Avenatti offered a
4   $100,000 reward.  I would have never agreed to that.
5       Q.   Michael Avenatti never had to pay that $100,000 reward,
6   did he?
7       A.   No.
8       Q.   Because no one ever came forward and said, "I know who
9   this man might be?"
10       A.   A lot of people did.  Either none of them checked out,
11   or he didn't follow up on it.  He definitely got a lot of hits.
12       Q.   That's because this man never existed?
13       A.   He absolutely existed.
14       Q.   The whole story was made up?
15       A.   No, none of it was made.
16                 MS. NECHELES:  Can we take an afternoon break?
17                 THE COURT:  Would you like to take a break?
18                 MS. NECHELES:  Yes.
19                 THE COURT:   All right.
20                 Jurors, let's take an afternoon break.
21                 You can all step out.

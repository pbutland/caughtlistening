1       A    Yes.
2       Q    Aside from the redactions, is it exactly the same?
3       A    Yes, it is a match.
4                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I now offer People's Exhibit
5       229-A in evidence, your Honor.
6                 MS. NECHELES:  No objection.
7                 THE COURT:  Was that 228 or 229?
8                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It was, actually, 229-A.
9                 We are jumping a little.  We will get back to
10       228.  I apologize.
11                 THE COURT:  Okay.  Accepted into evidence.
12   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
13       Q    Tell us what that contact shows.
14       A    It says -- it is saved under the name, Keith Trump,
15   that I put Trump because I didn't know his last name when I
16   saved it.  And then the phone number that he texted me from
17   that I saved.
18       Q    And in listing it in your phone as Keith Trump, you
19   said you didn't know his last name, why did you put the name
20   Trump there?
21       A    I know a lot of people named Keith, and I wanted to
22   make sure I knew which one, which Keith it was, and because I
23   didn't know his last name, at least I know who he works for.
24            I do that a lot, put the name -- it's stupid -- or I
25   put where they are from.

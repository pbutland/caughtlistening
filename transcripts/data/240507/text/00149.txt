2       A    $130,000.
3       Q    And how did you feel about that $130,000 at the time?
4       A    Didn't care. I didn't care about the amount. It was
5   just to get it done.
6       Q    Were you happy --
7       A    Of course. Well, of course. It's money, but the number
8   didn't matter to me.
9       And I didn't pick the number.
10       Q    And did you -- did you negotiate that number at all?
11       A    No.
12       Q    Why didn't you ask for more money?
13       A    Because I didn't care about the money.
14       Q    What was your financial outlook in that time, in
15   October of 2016, relative to earlier years?
16       A    It was the best it had ever been.
17       Q    I'm sorry?
18       A    The best it had ever been. Instead of directing five
19   movies a year, I directed ten. I had gotten several raises. I
20   bought a house. We no longer lived in California, which was
21   really expensive. And I was able to go back to work. I was
22   working for a while, but it was on camera and on stage. Things
23   were good, very good.
24       I was winning with my horses, too.
25       Q    Let me direct your attention to October 10, 2016.

1 Q Now, did there come a time that you started also doing
2 some other work, for example, nude modeling for some magazines?
3 A Yes, when I was 21.
4 Q Why did you do that?
5 A Well, I was working at the club, as I said, and we
6 would have, like, guest stars. They are called featured
7 entertainers. For those that don't know, it's like traveling
8 acts that come in, and they headline at the club.
9 They put on very fancy burlesque shows. They either
10 breathe fire or do aerial, stilts, just like they are the star
11 performance and they give them all the special treatment.
12 And because I had this background in actual dancing,
13 and I was like, I want to do that, but you have to have some
14 sort of —— a reason to be the headliner. You have to have a
15 reason they pay you to come in and be the star. And the way to
16 do that is either to pose for magazines or do competitions or
17 to do adult movies.
18 So, if you are a regular girl in the club, you can
19 come and perform, but if you were like in Playboy, or Playboy
20 centerfolds, or one of those people, then you could be a
21 headliner.
22 So, you would have to have what they would call
23 credentials or credits.
24 And so, I asked a lot of those performers how they got
25 those, and, of course, they said you have to have these credits

1 Q Was it the fact that he worked for Mr. Trump that you
2 put the last name Trump in your phone?
3 A Correct.
4 Q Do you still have Keith’s contact in your phone to
5 this day?
6 A Yes.
7 Q Now, after you left the golf tournament, did you speak
8 with anyone else about the dinner invitation from Mr. Trump
9 that Keith extended to you?
10 A Yes.
11 Q Who did you discuss it with?
12 A Immediately, my then publicist. His name was Mike.
13 He was the first, and I think the only one that immediately I
14 talked to about it.
15 Q And what —— could you tell us a little bit about the
16 conversation with Mike and what it led you to end up doing?
17 A So, I was scheduled to have a dinner or to go to
18 dinner with everyone from the company that I worked for, and I
19 really didn’t want to go to that dinner. There was a couple of
20 people at that dinner that I didn't want to be around, you
21 know, cat fight and stuff.
22 And so, I said, well, I can go to this, not that I
23 ever would.
24 And he said, wait, this is amazing. You totally
25 should. What better excuse do you have to get out of this

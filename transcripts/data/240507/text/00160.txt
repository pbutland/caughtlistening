l AFTERNOON SESSION
2 THE COURT: Good afternoon.
3 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.
4 THE COURT: If I could have a second, Mr. Blanche.
5 MR. BLANCHE: Pardon me?
6 THE COURT: If 1 could just have one second,
7 Mr. Blanche.
8 MR. BLANCHE: Oh, your Honor, I'm sorry.
9 THE COURT: Just for the record, my Chambers
10 reached out to the People and Defense Counsel to ask if
11 Defense Counsel wanted a limiting instruction on the
12 encounter that took place in the parking lot where
13 Ms. Daniels claims that someone had threatened her.
14 I will not give a limiting instruction unless the
15 Defense requests it.
16 And even then, I would ask the two sides to see if
17 you can agree on a proposed limiting instruction.
18 I realize that you haven't had a lot of time to
19 work on that.
20 But I also received your email that you wanted to
21 make an application.
22 Please go ahead.
23 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
24 We move for a mistrial based on the testimony this
25 morning.

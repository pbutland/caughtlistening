1 A That’s why it is funny. You don’t get selected to go
2 to jail.
3 Q It’s not because you think this is all funny?
4 A No. Absolutely not.
5 Q When you say —— so —— and that, in fact, is what you
6 tweeted; right?
7 A Yes. I am quoting another tweet.
8 Q You are quoting the word "selected"; right?
9 A Correct.
10 Q And everything else is your words; right?
11 A Correct.
12 Q Your words: "I won’t walk, I'll dance down the street
13 when he’s", quote, "selected", end quote, "to go to jail"?
14 A Correct.
15 Q And, part of the reason you hate him is because he
16 won a legal case against you and you owe him, today, over
17 half—a—million—dollars; right?
18 A He didn’t win the case.
19 He won attorney’s fees because I was not allowed to go to
20 trial. Court. Sorry.
21 Q You’re suing him for defamation; right?
22 A Yes.
23 Q But, your lawsuit was dismissed by the court, Federal
24 Court in California; right?
25 A Right. So it was not lost. It was dismissed.

11       Did you have a conversation with a friend of yours who is
12   an attorney?
13       A    Lots. Yes.
14       Q    And this particular friend who you had a discussion
15   with, were you seeking legal advice from him?
16       A    No.
17       I was just having lunch with him.
18       Q    And did you decide, based on a conversation with him,
19   about what you should do about getting the details of your
20   story out?
21       A    Yes. I do remember asking him what he thought about
22   the Gina situation because I had been threatened.
23       And he said that he thought it was really a really good
24   idea, that he was concerned about my safety.
25                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection, your Honor.

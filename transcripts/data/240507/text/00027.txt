S. Franklin - Cross/Blanche

1       Q    So you mentioned that on both of these books there is a
2   second name on the front page, "Meredith McIver;" correct?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    And is what -- is her role sometimes called "a ghost
5   writer?"
6       A    It depends.  Sure.  I mean, I'm not sure exactly what
7   she -- how much she did for that book, but, sure, she could be a
8   ghost writer.
9       Q    So when you said you're not sure, you mean you don't
10   know what role Ms. McIver had in these two books?
11       A    I don't know how much she contributed.  I know that
12   Donald Trump was the author of the book.  I'm not sure how
13   exactly specifically she contributed.
14       Q    And you're not sure because it varies depending on the
15   book, the primary author, and if there is a secondary author, it
16   could vary; correct?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    So at times, does someone like Ms. McIver sit and
19   interview the primary author as the book is written?
20       A    Ummm, I mean, I'm not sure exactly, again, what she
21   did.
22       Q    I'm not asking you what she did --
23       A    Okay.
24       Q    -- I'm just asking you, in your experience, is that
25   something that happened at times?

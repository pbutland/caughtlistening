1       Q    And why was it upsetting to you?
2       A    Because he could talk about it and I couldn't.
3       Q    Around this time, did you -- around February of 2018,
4   did Michael Cohen try to prevent you from coming out and telling
5   the truth about what occurred?
6       A    I'm not sure if it was Michael Cohen.
7       Q    Okay.  Did Michael Cohen file or have lawyers file a
8   Temporary Restraining Order against you in about February of
9   2018?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    And can you just explain what your understanding was of
12   that Temporary Restraining Order?
13       A    It was to keep me from speaking or that I would be held
14   accountable for the million dollars that was mentioned in the
15   NDA.
16       Q    Or --
17       A    Per episode.
18       Q    And following -- around that time, after you were
19   served, around the time you were served with the Temporary
20   Restraining Order, did you hire another lawyer at that time?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And who did you hire?
23       A    Michael Avenatti.
24       Q    And did you hire him to try to get out of the NDA at
25   that point?

9 Q. What did the contact read at the time?
10 A. The name?
11 Q. Yes.
12 A. "D. Trump Rona."
13 Q. And why did you enter it that way, "D. Trump Rona?"
14 A. Well, I didn't want to type Donald Trump, so I put in
15 Rona. The same thing, I didn't know her last name. So it's
16 kind of like the Keith one, it's how I remember it, what it was
17 for, and if I needed to get a hold of him. That's why his
18 name was first. I needed to get a hold of a woman named Rhona.
19 MS. HOFFINGER: You can take it down.
20 Now, please, show what is in evidence as People's
21 Exhibit 83.
22 Actually, you can show it on all the screens.
23 Thank you.
24 Maybe we can blow it up.

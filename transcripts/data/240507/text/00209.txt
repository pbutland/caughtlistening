S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger

1       A    The next morning, yes.
2       Q    Can you read it for us, please?
3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Maybe you might want to make it a
4        little bit bigger, if it's possible.
5                 (Displayed.)
6       A    I can see it.  I'm good.
7       "I did nothing wrong in the 'Horseface' case.  I see she
8   showed up in New York today trying to drum up some publicity for
9   herself.  I haven't seen or spoken to her since I took a picture
10   with her on a golf course in full golf gear including a hat
11   close to 18 years ago."
12       "She knows nothing about me other than her con man lawyer
13   Avenatti and convicted liar and felon jailbird Michael Cohen may
14   have schemed up."
15       "Never had an affair with her."
16       "Just another false acquisition by a 'SleazeBag.'"
17       That's a typo, I guess, "by Sleazebag."  Period.
18       "Witch Hunt!"  Exclamation point.
19       Q    Who did you understand Mr. Trump to be referring to as
20   "Horseface" and "SleazeBag" in this post?
21       A    Me.
22       Q    Had he called you "Horseface" publicly before?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And has he also called you "SleazeBag" publicly
25   before?

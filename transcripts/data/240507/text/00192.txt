19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And did you want that article out at that point?
21       A    No.
22       Q    And that article, when you first gave the interview,
23   were you supposed to have been paid for it?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And did you get paid in 2018 when they released it?

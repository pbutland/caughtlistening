1   first?
2       A    It is not a site that I look at, so I'm not entirely
3   sure. But, it is the online equivalent to a tabloid. A gossip
4   site. Trash site.
5       Q    You said Gina Rodriguez told you there was something
6   up on thedirty.com?
7       A    Yes.
8       She called and told me about it. I think she might have
9   sent me a link, and I looked at it.
10       It's not a site I looked at at the time. Celebrity gossip
11   site.
12       Q    Did you provide information to that site?
13       A    No.  I never even heard of that site at that time.
14       Q    Were you concerned about it being up at the time?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    Why were you concerned?
17       A    Because I had been threatened, and I didn't want the
18   person who threatened me and my baby thinking I had done it.
19       Q    At that point, did you want it taken down?
20       A    Absolutely.
21       Q    What, if anything, did Gina, your agent --
22       A    Well --
23       Q    Hold up -- say about being able to take it down?
24       A    I remember I was freaking out and crying and
25   hyperventilating and asked her what I should do.

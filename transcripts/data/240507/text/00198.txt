1 A Yes.
2 Q Why did you want to get out of the NDA at that point?
3 A So that I could stand up for myself.
4 Q Now, in about March, early March of 2018, did
5 Mr. Avenatti file a lawsuit in California against Donald Trump
6 and Michael Cohen's company, Essential Consultants, to try to
7 get you out of the NDA?
8 A Yes.
9 Q After your lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed that lawsuit
10 to get you out of the NDA, did you also go on 60 Minutes to
11 speak to Anderson Cooper?
12 A Yes.
13 Q Why did you do that?
14 A To get my story out.
15 Q And you did that even though there was a risk that you
16 could be held responsible for breach of the NDA?
17 A Yes.
18 Q Is it your understanding that by the Fall of 2018,
19 Mr. Trump and Michael Cohen agreed not to enforce that NDA that
20 you had signed?
21 A Yes.
22 Q And so, was it your understanding that you were then
23 legally free from the NDA so that you could speak publicly and
24 freely about who occurred?
25 A Yes.

S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger

1       A.   When I came out of the bathroom, I expected to exit, go
2   around the bed and back out to where we had been sitting and
3   talking and hopefully say; Okay, time to go, I have been here
4   for a long time.
5            That was actually when I realized how long I had been
6   there.
7            And when I opened the bathroom door to come out,
8   Mr. Trump had come into the bedroom and was on the bed,
9   basically between myself and the exit.
10       Q.   What was he wearing at the time?
11       A.   His boxer shorts and t-shirt.
12       Q.   What was your reaction to seeing him like that?
13       A.   At first, I was just startled, like jump scare.  I
14   wasn't expecting someone to be there, especially minus a lot of
15   clothing.  That's when I had that moment where I felt the room
16   spin in slow motion.  I felt the blood basically leave my hands
17   and my feet and almost like if you stand up too fast, and
18   everything kind of spinned, that happened too.
19            Then I just thought, oh, my God, what did I misread to
20   get here.  Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody
21   stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like
22   waiting for you.
23       Q.   What happened when you came out of the bathroom, did he
24   stay on the bed?
25       A.   When I exited, he was just up on the bed like this

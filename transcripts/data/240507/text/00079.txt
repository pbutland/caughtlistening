1 dinner than that you are going to have dinner with Donald
2 Trump. If nothing else, you will get a big story, and it will
3 be good to get you out of this dinner. He said, I think you
4 should go. It will make for a great story. He is a business
5 guy. Like, what could possibly go wrong?
6 That was his words to me.
7 Q Did he persuade you that it would be good for your
8 career?
9 A Yes, he implied. He said, at the very least, he could
10 probably have some interesting advice.
11 At the best, maybe he can get you a pilot with an
12 agent or something like that.
13 Q Did you end up going to his hotel, Mr. Trump’s hotel,
14 to have dinner with him?
15 A I did.
16 Q How did that come about?
17 A Keith messaged me —— I don’t remember who messaged
18 first.
19 I messaged back and forth with Keith and set it up to
20 arrange for me to go across town to where Mr. Trump was
21 staying. It was not the same hotel I was staying at, and I
22 meet him for dinner.
23 Q Do you recall what hotel Mr. Trump was staying at?
24 A I believe it was Harrah’s. It was not the same one as
25 me.

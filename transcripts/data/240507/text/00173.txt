Proceedings
2679
1 Whether these are new stories or not new stories,
2 the remedy is on cross—examination.
3 And, in fact, if they are new stories, the more
4 fodder that I will expect to see on cross—examination, if
5 you have any.
6 I also believe —— if you want, I will give a
7 limiting instruction regarding the incident at the parking
8 lot in 2011.
9 Just bear with me one moment.
10 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, can I just object to
11 that ——
12 THE COURT: One second, Ms. Necheles, please.
13 (Pause.)
14 THE COURT: Yes, Ms. Necheles?
15 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I think —— I just wanted
16 to be a little clearer, I did see that you, on your own,
17 sustained it.
18 But, we had moved beforehand to try to limit all of
19 this, and your Honor had ruled that it could come in, and so
20 I didn't want to keep saying objection.
21 THE COURT: That's a very general statement,
22 Ms. Necheles.
23 That's not accurate. If you are going to say
24 something like that, be accurate.
25 MS. NECHELES: Well, I'm trying to be accurate.

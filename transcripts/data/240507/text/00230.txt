1   Fact and Information Sheet for you?
2                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
3        and the parties' screens.)
4       A    Yes.
5                 MS. NECHELES:  I offer this in evidence.
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
7                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
8                 THE WITNESS:  (Whispering to the Court) This has
9        my address.
10       Q    Well, let me ask you, you only partially filled this
11   form out; right?
12                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
13                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
14                 MS. NECHELES:  Can I approach?
15                 THE WITNESS:  (Whispering to the Court) That's
16        got my address.
17                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
18        at sidebar:)
19                 MS. HOFFINGER:  We are getting way down the road
20        now in that case.
21                 Now, I understand they opened the door on bias
22        concerning the legal fees, and there's been a lot of
23        testimony elicited.
24                 But, at this point, this is entirely collateral.
25                 THE COURT:  I agree.

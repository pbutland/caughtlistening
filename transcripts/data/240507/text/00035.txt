8   BY MS. MANGOLD:
9       Q    Now, Ms. Franklin, I believe that you previously
10   testified that this exhibit and the next two are excerpts from
11   the book:  "Trump:  How To Get Rich;" is that right?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    And is this a page from that book?
14       A    It is.
15       Q    Is this the dedication page?
16       A    It is not.  It's the epigraph page.
17       Q    What's the epigraph page?
18       Am I saying that correctly?
19       A    I'm sorry.  It's a quote, like usually the dedication,
20   you know, the author dedicates the book to somebody.
21       This is a -- it's usually a quote from somebody very
22   important that the author wants to highlight to set up the
23   book.
24       Q    And are there -- how many quotes are on this page?
25       A    Two.

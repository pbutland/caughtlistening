1   table.  It looked very heavy, like a mahogany or something,
2   super fancy, with a big flower arrangement and a light above
3   it, and it was very, very nice.
4       Q    Did you mention anything about the floor?
5       A    The black and white tile.
6       Q    Did you mention that?
7            I might have missed it.  I apologize.
8            Now, describe, if you would, where you first
9   encountered Mr. Trump inside of the hotel suite?
10       A    It was right there inside of the doorway by the table
11   with the flowers.  And I called his name.  I said, hello.
12            And he came from one of the main areas of the hotel
13   suite.
14       Q    What -- did you notice what he was wearing at the time
15   when he came to greet you?
16       A    Yes.  He was wearing silk or satin pajamas, like
17   two-piece pajamas, that I immediately made fun of him for, and
18   said, does Mr. Hefner know you stole his pajamas?
19       Q    Who were you referring to when you said, Mr. Hefner?
20       A    Hugh Hefner, the owner of Playboy Magazine.
21       Q    Was that someone known for wearing pajamas out in
22   public?
23       A    It was sort of his signature uniform.  He wore satin
24   pajamas all the time.
25       Q    What did Mr. Trump do when you said that?

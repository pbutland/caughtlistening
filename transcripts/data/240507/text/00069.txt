S. Daniels — Direct/Hoffinger
2575
1 It was a very brief encounter on the course.
2 Q Do you recall, if at all, what you discussed with
3 Mr. Trump on the golf course at that time?
4 A It wasn’t very much. So, you know, the owner of the
5 company was like, this is my contract girl Jessica, and this is
6 my contract star and director Stormy Daniels.
7 And that's when he acted like, oh, you actually direct
8 too? You must be the smart one. And there is a picture and
9 they moved on.
10 Q And what did you know about Mr. Trump at the time, if
11 anything?
12 A Well, that he was, obviously, a golfer, and that he
13 had a television show I had never seen called Celebrity
14 Apprentice or The Apprentice, and he had done some reality TV
15 things.
16 Q Do you recall what the reality TV things were that you
17 knew about at the time?
18 A He did a lot of cameos and things like that. I
19 definitely remember seeing movies, commercials or whatever and
20 something —— something for wrestling, which I am from
21 Louisiana. It’s a big deal.
22 Q How old were you at the time?
23 A Twenty—seven.
24 Q And did you know his approximate age, or could you
25 tell his approximate age at the time?

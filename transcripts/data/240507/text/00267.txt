1 MS. NECHELES: If we can put that up and turn to
2 Page 2. And if we can blow up the part that starts with
3 "Stormy Daniels." If we can go to the prior line.

5 Q. This is in evidence of texts between Gina Rodriguez and
6 Dylan Howard. Do you see in the first box, it is dated June 28,
7 2016?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. And Gina —— and you see where it says "from G?"
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. There is a redaction?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Do you see that? I represent to you that is Gina
14 Rodriguez's email address that has been redacted out.
15 Am I correct that she says "Stormy Daniels" in the next
16 box, she says, "I have her?"
17 MS. HOFFINGER: I am going to object as asking
18 this witness what someone else said.
19 THE COURT: It's in evidence.
20 If you can confirm that is what it says, that is
21 what it says.
22 Q. And then Dylan Howard in the next box asks, "Is she
23 ready to talk; right?"
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And it says, "I thought she denounced it previously,"

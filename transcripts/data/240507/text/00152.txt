5       "Ms. Daniels expressed dissatisfaction with your schedule
6   of a delay for ten days of for funding. To that end, you'll see

12       Q    Did you express dissatisfaction and want this signed
13   and done by October 14th?
14       A    Absolutely.
15       Q    Why was that?
16       A    Because I was afraid that if he -- that if it wasn't
17   done before the nomination and things, that I wouldn't be safe,
18   or that he would never pay, and there wouldn't be a trail to
19   keep me safe.
20       Q    When you say "before the nomination", was Mr. Trump
21   already the nominee at that point of the Republican Party?
22       A    I believe so.
23       In the election. Sorry. The election is what I meant to
24   say. The election.
25       Q    That's okay.

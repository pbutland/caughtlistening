1 at a tattoo parlor.
2 And as I was walking, she called my name. Her name is
3 Alana. And she is who I bumped into on my way over there and
4 the one I told I was on my way to see him. And I know she
5 didn’t believe me. So when he was like, do you know anybody
6 else? I also had two reasons for calling Alana. One because I
7 am telling the truth. I am with Donald Trump. And, two, he
8 asked me to call one of my friends and I didn't want to call my
9 colleague from Wicked.
10 Q Did you end up calling your friend Alana from the
11 hotel room?
12 A Yes.
13 Q Did you put her on speaker?
14 A Yeah.
15 Q What, if any, conversation did you and Mr. Trump have
16 with Alana on speaker?
17 A He said, hello, which meant that I won that bet.
18 I know she didn’t believe me, and they talked.
19 And she said, what are you guys doing?
20 And he said, we are just hanging out. Why don’t you
21 come over and hang out with us?
22 And she, I can’t remember what kind of excuse she
23 made.
24 She said, yeah, I will call you back in a little bit
25 or whatever. She didn’t. Time just kept going by.

Proceedings
2681
1 have reached a point where a mistrial is in order.
2 I believe that a limiting instruction as to that
3 incident in 2011 will cure that issue.
4 And I believe that you have a remedy of
5 cross—examination.
6 And, as I said before, the more times the story has
7 been changed, the more fodder for cross—examination that you
8 have.
9 So, I'm going to deny your motion for a mistrial at
10 this time.
11 Anything else?
12 Do you want to discuss a limiting instruction
13 now?

5. Franklin — Direct/Mangold

I walked away a few times, the price will come down."
2 "I understand that penny—pinching can have a negative
3 connotation ——as in 'miserly'—— but when you calculate how much
4 ten cents on a price can matter if you multiply it by a hundred
5 thousand or a million, the value of ten cents becomes clear."
6 "For instance, let's say I have to buy one hundred thousand
7 light bulbs for all of the buildings that I own and maintain
8 each year. If I manage to save ten cents on each light bulb,
9 that's a savings of ten thousand dollars per year!"
10 "That's ten thousand dollars I can put toward another
11 building or another investment or donate to a cause that needs
12 the money more than I do."
13 "Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances such as
14 percentages and cents. Numbers that seem trivial add up and
15 have enormous implications."
16 "My parents hammered frugality into me at an early age, and
17 it's the most important money—management skill a person can
18 use. Call it penny—pinching if you want to; I call it financial
19 smarts."

4 Q So you went with others from your company to promote
5 the company?
6 A Right. It was myself, the owner of the company, a
7 couple of the staff from the company, and some of the contract
8 girls, and the players would come around. You would stay at
9 your hole that had the company’s logo, and you would give them
10 water, towels, take a photo. And then later the next day, or
11 whatever, the evening, they would go to the gift rooms.
12 Q And did you meet Donald Trump on the golf course at
13 that celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe?
14 A Yes, I did.
15 Q Can you describe how you encountered him on the golf
16 course?
17 A It was a very brief encounter. The players were
18 playing. They came through very quickly. We met every person
19 who was in the golf tournament at that moment. They came
20 through.
21 Obviously, they would take their shot.
22 I would say, hello, and introduce myself to them. I
23 introduced myself, the company, and the other contract girls,
24 not just to Mr. Trump, but every player that came through.
25 Gave them water, posed for pictures.

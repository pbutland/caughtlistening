1       My daughter's father also was struggling with his own
2   personal issues at the time.
3       Q    So, did you tell your boyfriend at the time --
4       A    No.
5       Q    -- about the encounter?
6       A    No.
7       Q    That's because you were concerned about him?
8                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection to leading.
9                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
10       Q    Why did you not tell him?
11       A    Um, he was struggling mentally with some postpartum
12   stuff with our daughter and his alcoholism. Um, and I had never
13   told him about the fact that I'd had sex with Trump. So, for me
14   to tell him then, at that moment, when his whole world was
15   exploding, would have just not been good at all, on any level.
16       Q    Now, let me direct your attention to about October of
17   2011.
18       Did you become aware at around that time that an article
19   had come out and been posted online about your encounter with
20   Mr. Trump on a site called thedirty.com?
21       A    Yes.
22       Gina called and told me.
23       Q    Would that be Gina Rodriguez?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    Can you just tell the jury, what is thedirty.com,

S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2769
1       A.   I am saying that I did not give a statement denying the
2   story.  It says: "Daniels herself told E! News that she is not
3   commenting but the story is bullshit."  That is my one comment.
4       Q.   So you're saying where the article says you vehemently
5   deny this, the article is false; is that what you are saying?
6       A.   Yes.
7       Q.   Turning back to -- in 2011, you were denying to
8   thedirty.com that you had sex with President Trump?
9       A.   I never spoke to thedirty.com.  I couldn't have denied
10   it.  They put up a statement.  I was asked if I wanted Keith
11   Davidson to have it removed.  I absolutely wanted to have it
12   removed.  I didn't confirm or deny anything to The Dirty.  I
13   never spoke to them.
14       Q.   Well, your lawyer did?
15       A.   He told them to take the story down.  Whether he spoke
16   to them directly or not, I don't know.  All I know is, he wanted
17   it down and he took it down.
18       Q.   Keith Davidson was your lawyer?
19       A.   He was Gina's lawyer.  That is how I met him.  She
20   said, "Do you want me to have my attorney take it down?"  I
21   said, "Yes."
22       Q.   You asked him -- you authorized him to deny that story
23   was true and to get it taken down; right?
24       A.   No, I did not.  I authorized him to have the story
25   taken down.

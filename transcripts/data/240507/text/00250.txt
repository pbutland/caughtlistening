1 A False.
2 I did 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, and they gave me
3 zero.
4 Q We’ll get back to that.
5 I’m back in 2011. Right? You understand that; right?
6 A Yes.
7 Q And Anderson Cooper is in 2018; right?
8 A Yes.
9 Q So, in 2011 —— I’ll repeat my question.
10 One place won’t pay you money, you say you didn’t have sex
11 with President Trump; another place that’s offering you
12 $15,000, you gave an extensive interview, saying you did have
13 sex with President Trump?
14 A It was a 15—minute interview, and it was the only one
15 I did, and I turned down all of the other ones for money.
16 Q But, the answer to my question is "yes"; isn't it?
17 A No, it’s not.
18 Q And when you say it was a 15—minute interview, it was
19 a 22—page article; wasn’t it?
20 A Yes.
21 Q And that’s 22 pages of transcript; right?
22 A I don’t know.
23 Q And you’re a fast speaker, but you think you speak
24 that fast, that you could generate 22 pages of transcript in
25 15 minutes?

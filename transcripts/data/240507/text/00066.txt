1   saying, did you know about this?
2            There is a guy in Louisiana -- first, it came at me as
3   this person is using your name, your trademark name, and your
4   image to promote himself.
5            She was, actually, a little bit wrong.  It was a Draft
6   Stormy Campaign, and it was to go against the Republican David
7   Vitter, Senator David Vitter.
8            And I got really mad; and, basically, got ahold of the
9   guy, his name was Brian Welsh, and went after him to stop using
10   my name and image to promote himself.  But it wasn't to promote
11   himself, it.  Was to bring attention to this candidate, the
12   Republican candidate in Louisiana who was running on a platform
13   of like -- who was anti-women and was trying to shut down like
14   reproductive rights and sex education in school and Planned
15   Parenthood.
16            Meanwhile, he got caught doing some unsavory things.
17   And he had no intention of making me the Senator, but I was
18   helping to bring attention.  I jumped on board, and, basically,
19   was saying that I was a better choice than this guy.
20            But I dropped out.  I never wanted to actually move
21   back to Louisiana.  I didn't want to establish residency.  I
22   made a lot more money doing the job that I was doing at the
23   time, which made for some fun campaign slogans I would have
24   loved to use, but David Vitter would never actually -- he
25   wouldn't debate me.

4 A I didn’t know why it was late.
5 He just kept making excuses.
6 Q And what is your understanding about who kept making
7 excuses?
8 A Michael Cohen to Keith Davidson, because of —— Trump
9 to Cohen, and Cohen to Davidson.
10 Q That was your understanding?
11 A Yes.
12 Q Because you understood Michael Cohen represented
13 Mr. Trump?
14 A Correct.
15 Q Were you concerned about why these excuses were being
16 made and there was a delay in the payment?
17 A Yes.
18 Q What was your concern?
19 A Well, I mean, he, obviously —— that sum of money
20 shouldn’t matter, so it wasn’t a financial delay. So, it made
21 me more concerned that something bad was gonna happen, and that
22 if it wasn’t done before the election, that it was not ever
23 going to happen because he got whatever he wanted. And it goes
24 all the way back to me not being safe.
25 Q Let me direct your attention now ——

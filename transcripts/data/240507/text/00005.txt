Proceedings
2511
1                MS. HOFFINGER:  Well, your Honor, there will be
2       some details about the sexual act, very brief, very brief.
3       We have to elicit that they did have intercourse, your
4       Honor.
5                THE COURT:  Well, that's fine.
6                MS. HOFFINGER:  Okay.
7                THE COURT:  But we don't need to know the details
8       of the intercourse.
9                MS. HOFFINGER:  That's correct.
10                I agree with you that she has got credibility
11       issues, right, and, therefore, I think that makes it all the
12       more important for the People to establish her credibility
13       by eliciting certain background information about the events
14       that led to that encounter.
15                So I will allow that, based on the representations
16       that the People have made.
17                MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.
18                THE COURT:  All right.  People, please call your
19       next witness.
20                MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, your Honor --
21                THE COURT:  Let's get the jury first, yes.  That's
22       the third time.
23                THE COURT OFFICER:  All rise.  Jury entering.
24                (Jury enters.)
25                THE COURT:  You may all be seated.

1   you had earned so much money from making pornography that you
2   had just paid for your new ranch home?
3       A    I did tweet that, but I didn't own a home, and I do
4   not own a home.
5       Q    So, when you tweeted that, that was false?
6       A    We did not end up buying that house.
7       Q    And, am I correct that at that time you said you made
8   a million dollars in a book deal and in The Surreal Life, and
9   you're just doing the same job you've always done and love
10   doing, and that you just paid for your new ranch home?
11       A    I would have to see the tweet.
12       Q    Okay.
13                 MS. NECHELES:  We can pull up J-17.
14                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
15        and the parties' screens.)
16       Q    Isn't that correct, you said you just made a million
17   dollars?
18       A    I said I have made a million.
19       Q    And you said:  "I just paid" -- you said: "I just paid
20   for my new ranch;" right?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And that was on December 11th, 2022; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    So, was that a lie?
25       A    I pay rent at a ranch. I didn't say I purchased it.

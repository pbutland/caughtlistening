1        got information that is not signed by anybody.
2                 THE COURT:  Has this form been filed?

4        Trump's lawyer.
5                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You can look at it.
6                 THE COURT:  It got filed with the Court?
7                 MS. NECHELES:  It doesn't get filed, is my
8        understanding.
9                 It's not signed.
10                 THE COURT:  Can I see the form?
11                 MS. NECHELES:  Yes.
12                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It's entirely unsigned.
13                 (Whereupon, Ms. Necheles hands documents to the
14        Court.)

21                 MS. NECHELES:  It's not signed.
22                 I was going to ask her: She's been delaying, she
23        won't fill out the form for three years, four years.
24                 She just said: No, I had it filled out.
25                 That was her testimony.

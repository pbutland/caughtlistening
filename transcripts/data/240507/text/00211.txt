S. Daniels - Direct/Hoffinger
2717
1            (Continued from the previous page.)
2            MS. HOFFINGER:  Your Honor, may we approach for a
3   moment?
4            THE COURT:  Sure.
5            (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
6   at sidebar:)
7            MS. HOFFINGER:  I just want to be inordinately
8   careful.
9            I'm about to ask what the effect, if any, it had
10   on her.
11            You previously ruled we are allowed to elicit
12   information from subjects from these Truths or Tweets.
13            THE COURT:  What is the answer you expect?
14            MS. HOFFINGER:  It was frightening for her, she
15   didn't feel good about it, and I'm sure it had a chilling
16   effect.
17            MS. NECHELES:  Is that it? Or is she going to
18   talk about threats made to her or things like that?
19            MS. HOFFINGER:  I'll ask generally what affect it
20   had on her, seeing this.
21            MS. NECHELES:  Judge, we can't un-ring it if she
22   comes out and says that.
23            THE COURT:  I agree.
24            I think -- given the discussion we had earlier, I
25   think it's best to stay away from that.

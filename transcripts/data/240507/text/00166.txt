14 mistrial; and that to the extent that there is another
15 trial, that this witness is either excluded or that her
16 testimony is extremely limited to the guardrails, frankly,
17 that your Honor set this morning.

23 And your Honor did not put any guardrails on her
24 testimony.
25 Recognizing, of course, that this completes her

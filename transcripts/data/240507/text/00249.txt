S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2755
1       I was asked what I thought about all of this stuff, and I
2   said I thought it was bullshit.
3       Q    Well, you said the story was bullshit; right?
4       A    Yes. But I did not refer to the act.
5       The fact that there was a story and they were trying to
6   publicize it and put it on all these gossip sites was and still
7   is bullshit.
8       Q    So, you're saying now that was not a denial?
9       A    No.
10       Q    You're saying it was bullshit that it's going to be
11   reported; is that what you're saying?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    And that's at the same time you're trying to make
14   $15,000 off of this story?
15       A    (No response).
16       Q    Is that correct?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And, isn't it a fact that what you said depended on
19   who would pay you money?
20       A    No.
21       Q    Well, one place you say, "I didn't have sex;" the
22   other place you say, "I did have sex;" and it depends on who's
23   paying money; right?
24                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
25                 THE COURT:  Overruled.

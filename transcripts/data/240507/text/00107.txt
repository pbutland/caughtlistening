1   CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
2   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
3       Q.   I want to clarify and ask you to slow down so the
4   reporter can understand you.
5            Were you saying you were not drugged in any way; is
6   that correct?
7       A.   Correct.
8       Q.   You had not had any alcohol in any way?
9       A.   Correct.
10       Q.   Okay.
11            And that's what you were trying to convey?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   So, he was standing up and you were standing up.  What
14   were your relative heights?
15       A.   I am 5'6", 5'7", and I don't know how tall he was,
16   definitely several inches taller and much larger.
17       Q.   But you said you didn't feel threatened; is that right?
18                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection, leading.
19                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
20       Q.   Did you feel threatened by him?
21       A.   No, not physically.  Although, I did note there was a
22   bodyguard right outside the door.  There was an imbalance of
23   power for sure.  He was bigger and blocking the way.  But, I
24   mean, I was not threatened verbally or physically.
25       Q.   Can you briefly describe, at some point, did you end up

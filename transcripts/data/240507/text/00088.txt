1   industry, are we worried about getting pregnant or catching
2   something.
3            So it was a lot of that conversation.
4       Q    Did he ask about whether you had ever been tested?
5       A    Yes, of course.  I volunteered it as well.  At the
6   time you -- you will to be tested every 30 days.  Today it's
7   every 14 days.  You cannot work unless you have a test.
8            And yes, you know, have you ever had a bad test?
9            A bad test is something positive for something.
10            I said, nope.  I can show you my entire record.
11            Anybody in the industry can see anybody's testing.
12   You sort of waive that privilege.
13            But, yes, I have every test that I have ever done for
14   the last X amount of years.  At the time it was a month, now
15   it's twice a month.
16            I never had a bad test.  I never tested positive for
17   anything.
18       Q    Did you talk to him at all about protection, safety?
19       A    Yes, a little bit.  And I think that's kind of how we
20   segued into the safety conversation.
21            He said, aren't you worried about safety?
22            And I was quick to point out that my time in the
23   industry I chose to work for Wicked Pictures because they are
24   the only condom mandatory company.
25       Q    What does that mean?

1       credibility here.  So, therefore, the details are important.
2                  We have been careful, your Honor, to omit certain
3       details that might be too salacious.
4                We can, at some point, if you would like, list the
5       things that we are omitting, although I don't think that
6       it's necessary for me to do that in open court.
7                But the general details of what occurred, including
8       the sex act, barring certain details that are unnecessary,
9       are a significant part of the story, but also very important
10       for us in terms of her credibility.
11                THE COURT:  So when you say that some details

16       a sexual encounter with him.

18       conversation that occurred in the hotel room, at the
19       defendant's hotel room.
20                I think the full conversation is very, very
21       important.
22                How she even ended up having a sexual act with him,
23       and then in terms of the sexual act, it will be just very
24       basic.

1 Q I'm sorry. Was it "a computer signing a check?"
2 A Oh, sorry. "For me, there's nothing worse than a
3 computer signing checks."
4 "When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing what's really
5 going on inside your business."
6 "And if people see your signature at the bottom of a check,
7 they know you're watching them, and they screw you less because
8 they have proof that you care about the details."

10 combination with the next full paragraph, please.

12 Q Can you read the next full paragraph, please?

16 influence on my life."
17 Q Ms. Franklin, in your experience, are references to the

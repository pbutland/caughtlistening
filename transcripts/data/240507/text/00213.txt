S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2719
1   to "several grueling prep sessions, which included brutal mock
2   cross-examinations"; correct?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    And that -- and you say that that's not rehearsing
5   your testimony?
6       A    It is not rehearsing my testimony.
7       Q    But, you pretended to be being cross-examined; right?
8       A    My testimony was not rehearsed.
9       Q    That was not my question.
10       Do you want me to repeat my question?
11       A    Yes, please.
12       Q    Okay.
13       You pretended to be cross-examined; didn't you?
14       A    Um, no.
15       Q    Well, when you said that -- just now, you agreed that
16   you were subjected to "grueling prep sessions, which included
17   brutal mock cross-examination".
18       "Mock cross-examination" means that they had someone who
19   pretended to be cross-examining you; right?
20                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
21                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
22                 You can answer.
23       A    There were a lot of parts. Which part would you like
24   me to answer first?
25       Q    Okay.

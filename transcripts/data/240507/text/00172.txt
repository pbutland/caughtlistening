1   guardrails in place.
2            I do think that the Court instructed the
3   Prosecution that there were certain details that we don't
4   need to get into.
5            And, again, I'm not dismissing what you are saying.
6   I do think that there were some things that were better left
7   unsaid.
8            Having said that, I don't believe we are at the
9   point where a mistrial is warranted.
10            There are a few things that go along with that.
11            I will note that where there were objections, the
12   objections, for the most part, were sustained.
13            Where there was a motion to strike testimony, for
14   the most part, that motion was granted as well.
15            I will also note that I was surprised that there
16   were not more objections at various times during the
17   testimony.
18            And, in fact, at one point the Court sua sponte
19   objected because there was no objection coming from the
20   defense.
21            So, when you say that, you know, the bell has been
22   rung, the defense has to take some responsibility for that.
23             The Court has done everything that I can possibly
24   do to protect both sides and to ensure fairness and that's
25   why, again, I objected on my own.

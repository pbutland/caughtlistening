1       In April of 2018, did Mr. Avenatti release a sketch of the
2   man who you believed you had that encounter with in 2011?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    And in response to that sketch, did Mr. Trump tweet
5   that the sketch was essentially a con job?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And, to your understanding, was that defamation case
8   filed based only on that tweet about whether the sketch was a
9   con job?
10       A    Yes, it was about the tweet.
11       Q    Did the defamation claim have anything to do with
12   whether or not you were paid for the NDA before the election?
13       A    No.
14       Q    Did the claim of defamation have anything to do with
15   whether or not you had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump or any
16   other interactions with him?
17       A    No.
18       Q    What is your understanding about whether the Court in
19   that case made any finding with respect to your credibility
20   whatsoever?
21       A    There were none.
22       Q    Is it your understanding that the Court determined in
23   that case that Mr. Trump was free to tweet "con job" because it
24   was what the Court called "rhetorical hyperbole?"
25       A    Correct.

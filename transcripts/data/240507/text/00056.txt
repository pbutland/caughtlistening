2 So I graduated from Scotlandville Magnet High School in

4 I graduated top ten percent of my class for the country, and

6 I received a full scholarship from Texas A & M for
7 veterinary medicine, and —— but even that still requires you to

9 So I took a year off from that and never actually got to go
10 back.
11 Q So you never actually went —— you didn't go to college;
12 correct?
13 A Correct. But I did take college classes in high
14 school.
15 Q And did you participate in some clubs in high school?

21 I was in 4—H because I loved horses and, also, so they would

23 And then I was, aside from the regular 4—H, I was in the
24 Equine Department of —— the 4—H Department, which is the
25 equestrian horseback riding part of that.

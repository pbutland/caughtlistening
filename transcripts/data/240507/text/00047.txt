Proceedings
2553
1                Look, I think her account of what happened on that
2       day is the account that would have been told to the American
3       people prior to the election had she not entered into the
4       NDA.
5                It's significant.
6                THE COURT:  Give me a sense of what she's going to
7       say when she talks about her feelings, how she felt that
8       day?
9                MS. HOFFINGER:  I mean, she's going to say, for
10       example, at certain times she felt feelings leaving her
11       hands and toes, that she felt that she was having a panic
12       attack at one point.
13                She will describe that some details came back to
14       her later after seeing a movie called Bombshell, for
15       example, which I think will help to explain certain times
16       about what she remembered and what she didn't remember.
17                So it's not going to be in great detail, but I
18       think it's significant because for a period of time she
19       didn't remember how she got into bed and had sex with
20       him.
21                And so I think it's important to bring out
22       partly how she was feeling at the time, because it explains
23       that.
24                And, again, the defense opened the door from the
25       start to credibility issues.

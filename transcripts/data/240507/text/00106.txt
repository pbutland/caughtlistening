1   never insinuated that I was on drugs.  I was not drunk.  I never
2   said anything of that sort.  I just don't remember --
3                 MS. NECHELES:  I object.
4                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
5       Q.   Did you at some point --
6                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
7                 (Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
8                 THE COURT:  Tell me what your objection is?
9                 MS. NECHELES:  She is making it sound like she was
10        drugged.
11                 MS. HOFFINGER:  She said she wasn't drugged.
12                 MS. NECHELES:  She said she is dizzy, she blacked
13        out.
14                 THE COURT:  I got the impression she was saying
15        she wasn't drugged.  She is not suggesting she was drugged.
16                 I sustained your objection.
17                 If you want -- I got the impression -- Do you want
18        to consult with the other lawyers.
19                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I can clarify, if you would like.
20                 MS. NECHELES:  I think it should be clarified.
21        She is not saying she was not.
22                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Sure, I can do that.
23                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in
24        open court:)
25                 THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.

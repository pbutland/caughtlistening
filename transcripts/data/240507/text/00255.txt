S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2761
1       Q.   You didn't even tell your husband who was the father of
2   the child who you claim was threatened; right?
3       A.   Correct.
4       Q.   The first time you publicly told this story that was
5   about a supposed threat to your life was in 2018; right?
6       A.   I don't remember.
7       Q.   Well, it was on the Anderson Cooper show; wasn't it?
8       A.   Publicly in like an interview?
9       Q.   Yes.  Yes.
10       A.   I know I had told it before that because a colleague
11   told it in an interview she did about me.  She was the only
12   person that I called that day or the next day after it happened.
13       Q.   At the time, though, in your book, you said you told no
14   one; right?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Now you claim you told a colleague?
17       A.   Uh-huh.  Afterwards, not that day.
18       Q.   But you wrote, you told nobody about this story?
19       A.   Which I said in the book, as you just read, "I told
20   nobody about it that day or the days that followed."
21       Q.   So the first time you mentioned it publicly was seven
22   years after it supposedly happened; right?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And for seven years it's your claim that you kept this
25   story secret from your husband; right?

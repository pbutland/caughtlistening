1 A Yes. Pages 66 and 67.
2 Q What is the chapter title?
3 A "How to Decide How Much Risk to Assume" —— I'm sorry,
4 "How to Decide How Much Risk to Assume When Investing."
5 Q Can you please read for the jury the unredacted portion
6 of this chapter.
7 A "You need to watch the bottom line. Allen Weisselberg,
8 my Chief Financial Officer, has to be one of the toughest people
9 in business when it comes to money."
10 "When I was having some financial problems in the early
11 1990s, I called Allen into my office" —— and told him there
12 wouldn't —— "and told him there would be tough times ahead."
13 "The banks were about to cut off our funding. Allen said,
14 'No problem,’ and went be back to his office, where he
15 proceeded to renegotiate almost every payment from that point
16 forward."
17 "He did whatever was necessary to protect the bottom line ——
18 and refused to succumb to the pressures of risk."
19 "Now he's negotiating with bankers on deals worth hundreds
20 of millions of dollars and he's so tough that most banks would
21 rather I negotiate the deal than him. He's a loyal employee
22 and he's the ultimate master at playing the cards of
23 business."
24 MS. MANGOLD: And then, lastly, can we pull up
25 what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 414D.

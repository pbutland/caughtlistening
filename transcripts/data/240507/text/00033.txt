S. Franklin - Redirect/Mangold
2539
1       books showing quotes from the author and information that is
2       within the primary author's unique knowledge.
3                And to the extent that the defense is challenging
4       attribution, these establish that the defendant was aware of
5       statements in his -- throughout his book.
6                MR. BLANCHE:  In no way did I challenge
7       attribution.
8                I just asked the witness to explain what a ghost
9       writer was; if she had any knowledge about the ghost writer.
10       That's not challenging attribution even a little bit.
11                THE COURT:  You questioned that it was possible
12       that there were contents in that book that you are not
13       attributing to your client, that possibly it was written by
14       the ghost writer.  I think it's fair.
15                MR. BLANCHE:  I'm not allowed to introduce exhibits
16       that were never produced to the People, your Honor.
17                We did not open the door based upon a question
18       about just what a ghost writer is and what a ghost writer
19       may do.
20                Also, your Honor, as to exhibits that were not
21       produced to the Defense --
22                THE COURT:  You just asked one question about it?
23                MR. BLANCHE:  Excuse me?
24                THE COURT:  You just asked one question about it,
25       about a ghost writer?

1       Q.   Did he on that occasion tell you to keep it
2   confidential and not to tell anyone?
3       A.   Absolutely not.
4       Q.   Did he appear to be concerned with anybody else finding
5   out that you were there with him?
6       A.   Absolutely not.
7       Q.   Was that the last time that you saw him in person?
8       A.   Yes.
9       Q.   And did he call you after this meeting in the bungalow
10   in L.A., did he call you again?
11       A.   Like that night?
12       Q.   Did he call you another time?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Approximately, how many times did he call you?
15       A.   A few more times.  One was to tell me that he could not
16   get me on the television show, that he had been overruled by
17   his -- he had been overruled by someone higher up's wife having
18   a problem.  He owed it to them to go with their opinion, I
19   guess.
20            And he tried a couple of more times; I did not answer
21   his call.
22            Then one time I did answer, it was a New York number, I
23   didn't always know that it was him, to tell me that he did not
24   know that Jenna Jameson was going to be on the show.
25       Q.   Who was Jenna Jameson?

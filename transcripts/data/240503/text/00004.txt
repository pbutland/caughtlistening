1                But there is a lot of information on every tweet,
2       for example, the name @realDonaldTrump, the time it was sent
3       and other information, that's hearsay.
4                And that hearsay, we don't believe, is admissible
5       through just a summary witness who doesn't have any
6       foundational expertise to talk about the basis for how the
7       date is put on the tweet, how -- you know, the typical
8       things that you would expect for any type of business
9       records.
10                The same thing with the Truths, your Honor, the
11       same exact problem.
12                There is content within the Truth that purportedly
13       they will argue are President Trump's statements.
14                But there is a lot of stuff in that exhibit that is
15       pure hearsay, and it is an out-of-court statement that will
16       be offered for the truth of the matter asserted:  The date,
17       the time, the handle.
18                And without a proper foundation, we object to that
19       coming in.
20                The straight -- and the same is true of the
21       Washington Post tweet for the same reasons.
22                And the same is true of the Washington Post article
23       for the same reasons.
24                Separately, for three of the exhibits, putting
25       aside the hearsay objection, we don't believe they should

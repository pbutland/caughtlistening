1       A    That's correct.
2       Q    But when you have testified that the number of contacts
3   was unusual, one potential explanation for the unusual nature of
4   the number of contacts is this laptop syncing; correct?
5       A    It could be.
6       Q    So let's talk some more about this audio file, all
7   right.
8       I think you had acknowledged yesterday that the file cuts
9   off mid conversation; correct?
10       A    Towards the end of it.
11       Q    Well, how do you know if it's towards the end of the
12   conversation?
13       A    Because it -- when you listened to the whole thing and
14   the last 46 seconds and then it cuts off.
15       Q    Right.  So you just mean the conversation cuts off at
16   the end of the audio file, just to clarify?
17       A    That's correct.
18       Q    You didn't -- you don't know how long the conversation
19   continued; correct?
20       A    No, I don't.
21       Q    You are aware that a transcript of that audio file was
22   released to the public by Michael Cohen's lawyers in 2018;
23   right?
24       A    I had heard.
25       Q    Do you recall a news coverage relating to that release?

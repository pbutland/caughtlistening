5   BY MR. COLANGELO:
6       Q.   When did you begin work at the Trump Organization
7   fulltime?
8       A.   In October of 2014.
9       Q.   And I'm not sure you mentioned what year you received
10   your undergraduate degree, what year was that?
11       A.   I graduated from college in 2010.
12       Q.   You began working at The Trump Organization about four
13   years after you finished college?
14       A.   That's right.
15       Q.   And at some point after beginning to work at The Trump
16   Organization, did you also start working for the Trump
17   campaign?
18       A.   Yes.
19            Shortly after I joined The Trump Organization,
20   Mr. Trump -- at the time, Mr. Trump said that he would be
21   exploring a run for president.  And we began doing that in
22   January of 2015.
23            And then just a few months later, in March of 2015, he
24   formed a formal Exploratory Committee and announced he was
25   running as a candidate for President in June of 2015.

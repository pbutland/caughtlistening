1       A    We don't have that.
2       Q    And so, during that period, the January 19th through
3   the 23rd, you don't know if the phone was powered on or off;
4   right?
5       A    I do not.

7       A    I do not.
8       Q    You don't know if it was hooked up with the internet or
9   not; right?
10       A    I do not.
11       Q    Now, we talked yesterday about the -- a manual review
12   process for phones, taking pictures of what the contents of the
13   phone are; right?
14       A    Sometimes, yes.
15       Q    And I asked you:  Do you recall whether somebody at
16   HTAU did a manual review of CP1?
17       Do you remember that?
18       A    I don't recall anybody at HTAU doing a manual review.
19       Q    And I would like to show you --

23                 (Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.)
24       Q    And I want to see if that refreshes your recollection
25   about a manual review process?

1 Q And what did you speak with him about?
2 A Um, just asked what was going on; um, why was I
3 receiving this email. Um.
4 And he explained that, um, Karen McDougal was paid for
5 magazine covers and fitness columns, and that it was all very
6 legitimate, that that’s what the contract was for.
7 Q That's what Mr. Pecker explained to you on
8 November 4th, when you called him?
9 A That’s right.
10 Q Had you had discussions with Mr. Pecker before that
11 date having anything to do with Karen McDougal?
12 A Never.
13 Q You also mentioned you reached out to Michael Cohen;
14 is that right?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Did you end up speaking with him?
17 A Yes.
18 I believe I spoke with Michael before I spoke to
19 Mr. Pecker.
20 Q And what did Mr. Cohen say?
21 A Um, I —— I don’t really remember.
22 Um, but there was a reason I called David next. I think
23 Michael sort of —— feigned like he didn’t —— he didn't know
24 what I was talking about and that we should connect with David
25 to get more information.

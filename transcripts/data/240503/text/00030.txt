1       A    I do.
2       Q    And that was on January 25, 2017; correct?
3       A    That's correct.
4       Q    And on the same day, January 25, 2017, there was a sync
5   performed on the phone; right?
6       A    That's correct.
7       Q    And a sync is a situation where a user can connect a
8   phone to a laptop; right?
9       A    That's correct.
10       Q    And move data from the laptop onto the device; correct?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And in this instance, with CP1, in the sync that
13   happened in January of 2017, the phone was connected to a laptop
14   with a user named Michael-dot-Cohen; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And so, more than four months after the date that you
17   have associated with this audio file, there was some kind of
18   sync where Mr. Cohen plugged the phone into his laptop and
19   loaded some files from the laptop; right?
20       A    Right.  When you plug it into iTunes, it does a full
21   backup of whatever that backup is that you are restoring from
22   iTunes and restores everything back to that phone so that file
23   got restored at that time.
24       Q    That's one way just to do a sync, right, but there are
25   many ways that that transfer process could have occurred;

1   the great reporting.
2       Q.   What was the article about Dr. Carson about?
3       A.   Medical malpractice.

6       A.   I think he was just congratulating David on a great
7   investigative piece.  You know, sometimes he would say things

10       Q.   Was that the only time you heard or were present for a

19       A.   I think it was something about how his father may have

21       Q.   What, if anything, did you hear Mr. Trump say during
22   that phone call?
23       A.   Nothing remarkable.  Just similar to what he had said
24   the last time I had overheard a conversation; great reporting.
25       Q.   At some point during the campaign, did Mr. Trump become

1       problem with that.
2                I don't see the need for this.
3                This goes to the reason why I kept the tape out in
4       the first place.
5                I don't want those words to be associated with
6       Mr. Trump's face or his voice.
7                It's just very powerful evidence.  It's damming
8       evidence.  And I don't think it's necessary.
9                You are going to get to read the transcript.  You
10       are going to introduce testimony about it.
11                This is not necessary.
12                MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, would you be amenable to
13       us introducing it if we block out the picture and just
14       introduce the date and time that the article is published?
15                THE COURT:  And what is the purpose?
16                MS. MANGOLD:  Just to establish the original date
17       and time that the Access Hollywood tape -- story was
18       published.
19                (Mr. Blanche rises.)
20                THE COURT:  One second, Mr. Blanche.
21                Is there no other way to establish the date and
22       time of this tape?
23                MS. MANGOLD:  The other way would be through
24       Exhibit 405A, your Honor.
25                THE COURT:  Which is what?  I don't know it

1       A    Yes.
2       Q    What does that message say?
3       A    It says: "Hey. The President wants to know if you
4   called David Pecker again?"
5       Q    I think you testified that March 20th was the same day
6   that Karen McDougal sued American Media regarding her NDA
7   agreement?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    Did you speak to Mr. Pecker that day?
10       A    I have no recollection of speaking to David.
11       Q    You have no memory of that one way or the other?
12       A    I -- I don't.
13       I don't believe I called him, but I don't know. I don't
14   have a memory of it.
15       Q    So, are you saying it didn't happen, or you just don't
16   know one way or the other?
17                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
18                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
19       A    I don't know one way...
20       Q    And shortly after that -- shortly after filing that
21   lawsuit, did Ms. McDougal give an interview to Anderson Cooper
22   on CNN?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Do you remember when she gave that interview?
25       A    Um, March 24th?

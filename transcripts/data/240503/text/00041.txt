1        please.
2                   (Displayed.)
3       Q    And now, in that left pane, do you see there is a
4   folder with the name of the audio file?
5       A    That's correct.
6       Q    And in that folder is a file called "Manifest.P List."
7   Right?
8       A    There is.
9       Q    "P list" means property list; correct?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    And you said a minute ago that that contained
12   information about the timing of a sync; right?
13       A    It can, yes.
14       Q    And so, if you see that on the right, in the right
15   pane, there is a window with file information associated with
16   the Manifest.P List file?
17       A    I do.
18                 MR. BOVE:  Can I pause briefly to apologize to the
19        court reporter.
20       Q    Do you see the date associated with that?
21       A    I do.
22       Q    And the dates are October 17, 2020; right?
23       A    That's correct.
24       Q    And so, this reflects another sync between a laptop and
25   this phone, CP1; right?

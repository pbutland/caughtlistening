2       I take it you are not a friend of Michael Cohen's?
3       A    I'm not.
4       Q    So you don't hang around with him to track what he's
5   doing on a daily basis?
6       A    I do not.
7       Q    You were also asked a series of questions about a phone
8   being turned on and turned off and used.  Is it unusual for a
9   phone to be used?
10       A    No.
11       Q    Is it unusual for a phone to be used to make
12   recordings?
13       A    No.
14       Q    Now, you were asked a series of questions, just towards
15   the end of Mr. Bove's cross-examination, about other recordings
16   that were made on this phone; is that right?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    But those are noted, the recordings that are at issue
19   here in this case; is that right?
20       A    That's correct.
21       Q    I want to talk for a minute -- you were asked some
22   questions about the end of the phone call between the defendant
23   and Michael Cohen that we played the other day and sort of how
24   it ended and how it sort of cut off at the end?
25       A    Yes.

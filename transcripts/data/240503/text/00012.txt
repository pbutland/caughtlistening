Proceedings
2046
1       offhand.
2                MS. MANGOLD:  Which is --
3                (Handed.)
4                MS. MANGOLD:  This is the original version of the
5       article, which was published or retrieved from a website
6       called "The Wayback Machine," which finds previous versions
7       of websites and shows the original date of publication.
8                THE COURT:  All right.  So the People do have a
9       right to establish the date that it was printed.
10                You may want to stipulate to that.
11                I don't know if you want to stipulate to that, but
12       if you don't, I do have to give them the opportunity to
13       establish that.
14                MR. BLANCHE:  May I propose something -- one
15       second -- potentially.
16                If they show the witness, just the witness, either
17       the article or the -- or the tweet and say:  Was the article
18       published at, on this date, at this time, does that refresh
19       your recollection, we're not objecting, and the witness can
20       say yes.
21                I mean, that's all they're offering it for,
22       apparently.
23                Anyway, that's the way that you can get it in.
24                THE COURT:  I will leave it to the People, if
25       that's satisfactory.

1 and allowable.
2 Sandoval evidence of the case —— I am thinking of
3 People v. Grant, where the Court of Appeals held that a
4 prior criminal contempt conviction bears heavily on the
5 issues of veracity, since a person who wilfully violates
6 may logically be presumed to be, similarly, willing to
7 violate his obligation to tell the truth, despite his
8 having made a promise to the Court to testify honestly.
9 That is 7 NY 3d 421.
10 And the First Department reached the same
11 conclusion in a different case, People v. Ciochenda,
l2 C—I—O—C—H—E—N—D—A. That is 17 A.D. 3d 248.
13 Again, pointing out that the trial Court did not
14 abuse its discretion in allowing inquiry into instances
15 where the defendant violated Court Orders.
16 So, these findings, your Honor, are directly
17 relevant to the defendant's credibility, should he choose
18 to testify.
19 As the Court already noted, the balancing analysis
20 that the Court performs is to take into account not only
21 the potential prejudice to the defendant, but also the
22 prejudice to the People of being unable to present
23 important ——in some cases, dispositive evidence of the
24 defendant's credibility to the jury.
25 THE COURT: Thank you.

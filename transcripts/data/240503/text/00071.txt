G. Longstreet - Direct/Mangold
2105
1                 405-A.
2                 MR. BLANCHE:  405-A.  Well, I still have the
3       objection.
4                 So, 405-A, which is the Washington Post --
5                 THE COURT:  When you say, hearsay, you are
6       referring to what specifically?
7                 MR. BLANCHE:  Well, the -- it's the entire -- for
8       what the People are offering it for, they are offering it
9       for the date, which is an out-of-court statement being
10       offered for the truth.
11                 They are offering it for, I believe, the
12       Washington Post, which is an out of court statement being
13       offered for the truth.
14                 They are offering it, assuming the content is
15       hearsay, and they are offering it for who authored it,
16       which is an out of court statement being offered for the
17       truth.
18                 So, I will let the Government speak to what else
19       they --
20                 MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, we are offering to
21       withdraw this based on the stipulation.
22                 THE COURT:  Say that again.
23                 MS. MANGOLD:  We are offering to withdraw our
24       request to admit this based on the stipulation.
25                 THE COURT:  Okay.

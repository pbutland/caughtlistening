1 Q So, you understand Stephanie Clifford and Stormy
2 Daniels to be the same person?
3 A Yes.
4 Q How did you come to learn that this story would also
5 mention Stormy Daniels?
6 A The reporter told me on the phone.
7 Q Did you then, after learning that Stormy Daniels would
8 be in the story, did you have any discussions with Mr. Cohen
9 about Stormy Daniels?
10 A I believe I did.
11 I'm very fuzzy about this point, but I believe I spoke to
12 him.
13 Q Did you mention to Mr. Trump that Stormy Daniels would
14 be mentioned in the story?
15 A Yes.
16 Q What, if anything, did he say when you told him that
17 Stormy Daniels would be mentioned in The Wall Street Journal
18 story?
19 A He wanted to know the context, um, and he wanted to
20 make sure that there was a denial of any kind of relationship.
21 Q And, did you believe that denying the existence of a
22 relationship was responsive to the reporting?
23 A I felt the point of the story was that —— that the
24 National Enquirer paid a woman for her story and never
25 published it.

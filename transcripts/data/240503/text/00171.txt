1 He sent me David’s phone number.
2 And I said: "That’s the same one that I have. Thanks."
3 And Michael reiterated —— he sent a different phone number
4 and said: "He called me from this phone number this morning,"
5 I believe meaning Mr. Pecker.
6 And I replied at some point and said that they had already
7 spoken and it was all good.
8 Q Why did you ask Mr. Cohen for David Pecker’s phone
9 number?
10 A Mr. Trump wanted to speak to him.
ll Q When you say, "They spoke. All good," what does that
12 refer to?
13 A "They spoke."
14 The "All good" means: I don’t need your help anymore. They
15 spoke. It's all good.
16 Q Meaning, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker?
17 A Yes.
18 Q Were you present for the phone call between Mr. Trump
I9 and Mr. Pecker on the 5th?
20 A I wasn’t, no.
21 Q What was the response overall to The Wall Street
22 Journal article?
23 A Um, it was sort of muted. All relative compared to
24 some of the other stories we dabbled during the campaign, but
25 it didn’t get a lot of traction.

Proceedings
2039
1 come into evidence.
2 Turning first to 405A and B.
3 405A is the Washington Post article dated
4 October 7, 2016 laying out the purported Access Hollywood
5 tape.
6 Your Honor's ruling a couple of different times,
7 including from the motions in limine, about what would be
8 and what would not be allowed in with respect to the Access
9 Hollywood tape, the original ruling said no tape, but
10 witnesses could testify about it at the beginning of the
11 trial.
12 There is now going to be an email introduced that
13 has a transcript of a portion of that Access Hollywood
14 tape.
15 What the People want to introduce now under 405A is
16 the full —— what amounts to a full transcript from the
17 Washington Post article.
18 And, sure, there can be an instruction that says
19 it's not offered for the truth, but there are quotation
20 marks around the entire article.
21 And so, the danger of unfair prejudice is extreme

23 Remember, the only reason why the Access tape ——
24 Hollywood Access tape is coming in at all in this trial,
25 under the Court's ruling, is to show intent and motive and

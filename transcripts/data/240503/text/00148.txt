H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo
2182
1   The Wall Street Journal, to see if we could buy a little extra
2   time.
3       Q    What, if anything, did Mr. Kushner say to you in
4   response?
5       A    Um, I think he said that he wasn't going to be able to
6   reach Rupert and that we should just work out responding and
7   dealing with it.
8                 MR. COLANGELO:  We can go ahead and take that
9        exhibit down.
10       Q    You mentioned you did some other follow-up with regard
11   to this inquiry from Mr. Rothfeld; right?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    What else did you do?
14       A    I believe I called Michael Cohen, because I know he
15   had a relationship with Mr. Pecker, and I wanted to see if he
16   knew anything about this.
17       Q    Did you call anybody else?
18       A    I believe I called Mr. Pecker's office, as well, um,
19   to let them know that we had gotten this inquiry, and we
20   obviously didn't know anything about it, and tried to get an
21   understanding of what was going on.
22       Q    So, let's take those in turn.
23       When you called Mr. Pecker's office, did you, ultimately,
24   reach him?
25       A    I believe so.

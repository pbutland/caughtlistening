1 Q And so, you are testifying as a scientist who is trying
2 to draw some inferences from what you see on the screen; right?
3 A Correct.
4 Q This report —— my question was, does this report
5 reflect a date modified at all?
6 A No. Just the timestamp when it was created.
7 Q Now, I would like to look at another metadata report
8 that's in evidence.
9 MR. BOVE: So, Mr. Bernik, if we could bring up
10 Government Exhibit 253 in the top pane and 252 at the
11 bottom.
12 (Displayed.)
13 Q And so, this is the photograph that you testified about
14 yesterday; right?
15 A It was.
16 Q And you said that's Michael Cohen at the top?
17 A Yes.
18 Q And in the bottom, Government's 252, that is a report
19 of the metadata associated with that file; right?
20 A Yes, it is.
21 MR. BOVE: And if we could zoom in on the sixth
22 column beginning "Modified Date," please.
23 (Displayed.)
24 Q Do you see those columns?
25 A I do.

D. Daus - Redirect/Conroy
2083
1       Q    We talked -- we also put into evidence some call logs
2   from the phone?
3       A    Correct.
4       Q    From a WhatsApp application; is that right?
5       A    That's right.
6       Q    If you wanted to see if a call came in to a particular
7   phone number at a particular time, a long time ago, what would
8   be the best thing to look at to see if that happened?
9       A    A call detail record from the carrier.
10       Q    So that's not something that resides on the phone
11   itself; is that right?
12       A    That's correct.
13       Q    You are talking about the phone records from Verizon or
14   AT&T?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    That would be the best place to look to see if a phone
17   call came into a particular phone number at a particular time
18   that may have interrupted a recording?
19       A    That's the best source.
20       Q    Now, you were asked over the last couple of hours,
21   yesterday and today, a number of questions about things like
22   Faraday bags and special rooms and the care that has to be
23   taken, and it's all true, it's very important to be careful when
24   we are collecting evidence; correct?
25       A    It is.

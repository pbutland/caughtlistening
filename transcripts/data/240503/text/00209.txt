1        cross-examined on the findings of the Court earlier this
2        week, for a couple of different reasons.
3                 The first one is that, you know, this is a trial
4        where the jury sees you every day; and so, interjecting
5        into the cross-examination of President Trump a finding by
6        your Honor beyond a reasonable doubt of contempt raises --
7        and there are a lot of reasons that would go into
8        explaining it that, obviously, President Trump would have
9        to talk about.  It puts a layer on top of the testimony
10        that, really, the risk of prejudice, because it's in this
11        courtroom with your Honor, is greater than it is -- than it
12        would otherwise be.
13                 And, more importantly, or as importantly, for many
14        of the contempt findings -- the repost, for example, we're
15        appealing.
16                 We accept the Order of the Court.  There is no
17        case law that suggests that was a violation.  The Court
18        noted that.
19                 There is a lot that went into those reposts and a
20        lot of process that went into that.
21                 The finding of contempt is what it is.
22                 But, to be able to cross-examine President Trump
23        on that, if he takes the stand, just invites this whole
24        sideshow that the People don't need .
25                 And, especially, because they're already getting

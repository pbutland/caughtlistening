H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo
2130
1       A.   No.
2       Q.   In your role as Director of Communications, did you
3   also speak to Mr. Trump by phone?
4       A.   Yes.
5       Q.   About how often did you speak to him by phone?
6       A.   Well, again, once the campaign work started, my role
7   was a little bit different.  If we're talking -- rather than do
8   it by title, we will do it by date, if that works for you.
9            Beginning January 2015, I started to speak to him more
10   regularly.  I would say about June of 2015 I spoke with him on
11   the phone every day if we weren't able to communicate in person.
12       Q.   How did you reach him by phone when you spoke to him?
13       A.   I would usually call the office and be connected, but
14   he had a cell phone or a home phone number as well.
15       Q.   Focusing on your role as Director of Communications,
16   who did you report to at The Trump Organization?
17       A.   Everybody that works there in some sense reports to
18   Mr. Trump.
19            It's a very big and successful company, but it's really
20   run like a small family business in certain ways.  And Mr. Trump
21   and Don and Eric and Ivanka were very involved in the business
22   and so people reported to the four family members.
23       Q.   You mentioned a few names there, I want to make sure
24   the record is clear who they are.  You mentioned Don, Eric and
25   Ivanka.  Can you say who they are?

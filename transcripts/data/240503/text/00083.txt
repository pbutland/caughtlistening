12   reviewed in connection with this case that you have talked
13   about this morning?

17   at?
18       A    Well, the timeframe of the activity at the center of

20   added to the case.
21       Q    So, around 2015 to 2017, is that fair?
22       A    Yep.
23       Q    And then during the course of this investigation, so

25       A    Yep.

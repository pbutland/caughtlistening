H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo
2162
1   next day in Wisconsin?
2                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
3                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
4                 You can answer.
5       A    Um, I can't remember.
6       It's a little bit of a more nuanced response to that. I'm
7   happy to share, but --
8       Q    Please.
9       A    I believe, um, we were -- we were still invited to
10   attend, but, sort of, the programming had changed, and it was a
11   clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Trump with a new
12   program schedule.
13       So, I think Mr. Trump ultimately made the decision to do
14   something else.
15       Q    Did Mister -- did Speaker Ryan say he was "sickened"
16   by Mr. Trump's behavior?
17       A    I don't remember that, but it sounds like something he
18   would say.
19       Q    Who was Mitch McConnell at the time?
20       A    The majority leader of the Senate.
21       Q    Did Senator McConnell have a public response?
22       A    He did.
23       Q    What did Senator McConnell say?
24       A    Along the same lines. I don't recall exact words, but,
25   "disappointed", things like that.

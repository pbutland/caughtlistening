D. Daus - Cross/Bove
2066
1       A    Yes.
2       Q    And so, you know that there was the possibility to ask
3   Mr. Cohen for the laptop; right?
4       A    There certainly could be.
5       Q    Certainly, if you had the laptop, you could know with a
6   lot of precision all of the things that Mr. Cohen loaded on to
7   the phone in January of 2017; right?
8       A    I could.
9       Q    But that did not happen here; correct?
10       A    No.  It did not.
11       Q    And so, you testified yesterday that there were 39,745
12   contacts saved on CP1; right?
13       A    I did.
14       Q    And I think you said that was unusual; correct?
15       A    It is.
16       Q    But isn't it a fact that that is entirely consistent
17   with Michael Cohen dumping a bunch of data from his laptop onto
18   this phone?
19       A    It's the contacts that are assigned in his iCloud
20   account that over the years have accumulated to that many
21   contents.
22       Q    Yes, over the years on the laptop; right?
23       A    In whatever the account that he used to log in, yes.
24       Q    And we can only guess, because neither of us have seen
25   the laptop; right?

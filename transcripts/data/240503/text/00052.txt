1 getting to a point where an expert opinion is being elicited
2 from this witness.
3 We are allowed to cross—examine and impeach the
4 reliability of the evidence through this witness. This is
5 that witness.
6 He's not an expert. He can't offer an opinion like
7 that.
8 MR. CONROY: He's, I think, talking about the facts
9 of what he saw and what he did in his examination.
10 And this is responsive to the cross—examination.
11 And he can talk about his training and experience, which is
12 extensive.
13 THE COURT: You did a very effective job of
14 cross—examining this witness.
15 I think the People have the right to try and
16 rehabilitate the witness and bring out some facts.
17 If I recall correctly, during your
18 cross—examination at one point, you even referred to him as
19 an expert.
20 The objection is overruled.
21 (Sidebar concluded.)
22 THE COURT: The objection is overruled.

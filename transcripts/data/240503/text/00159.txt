1       There was nothing memorable. I don't really -- I don't
2   remember anything that was said, so...
3       Q    And you said this was on -- after the plane had landed
4   in Pennsylvania, after leaving the Ohio event where you had
5   been earlier that day?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    Do you remember where you started the day that
8   morning, on November 4th?
9       A    Um, I want to say Maine?
10       Q    So, was Ohio your first stop of the day or one of
11   several stops?
12       A    No. One of several stops.
13       Q    And, earlier, when you talked about a typical day for
14   you, you mentioned that some days had multiple stops, some days
15   had fewer; is that right?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    Did your mornings depend on how many stops you had
18   that day and where you needed to get to?
19       A    Yeah.
20       So, if we had more stops, we typically left earlier in the
21   day to account for additional travel and, you know, maybe
22   another rally, maybe another campaign stop of some kind.
23       If we had to do like two or three, which was pretty much
24   the average, we might start a little later; so, get to the
25   office around seven, but not leave for the airport until a

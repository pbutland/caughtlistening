I Q. And in the email you forwarded, did you write, "Need
2 to hear the tape, one, need to hear the tape to be sure; two,
3 deny, deny, deny?"
4 A. It's a reflex. I, obviously, was a little shocked and
5 not realizing that the entirety of the transcript was in the
6 email.
7 So strategy number two was going to be a little more
8 difficult.
9 But, yes, that is an email that I sent.
10 Q. Did you mean a little more difficult because it's hard
ll to deny a tape when there is a full transcript of it that you
12 already have?
13 MR. BOVE: Objection.
14 THE COURT: Sustained.
15 MR. COLANGELO: Withdrawn .
16 Q. Did you do anything else after you sent that message?
17 A. I went to find the group who was on a different floor
18 and talked to them.
19 Q. What floor was the group on that you went to speak with
20 further?
21 A. They were on the 25th floor.
22 Q. Who was present when you went upstairs to the 25th
23 floor?
24 A. Jason, Kellyanne, Stephen was there. I believe Jared
25 Kushner was there. I believe Stephen Miller was there. Maybe

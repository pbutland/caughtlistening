1                 THE COURT:  And the grounds for that objection
2       were?
3                 MR. BLANCHE:  As we stated earlier, there is
4       extensive -- it absolutely has nothing to do with the
5       witness.
6                 THE COURT:  I think we can proceed.
7                 MS. MANGOLD:  We are planning to admit that with
8       the next witness.  To the extent your Honor would like to
9       hear argument --
10                 THE COURT:  So, over objection.
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  Just to be clear about a hearsay
12       objection, we continue to have a hearsay objection.

18       for the truth.
19                 MS. MANGOLD:  We plan to lay a sufficient
20       foundation that the witness has sufficient familiarity with
21       the social media platforms and is able to identify things
22       based on handling the data.
23                 And as to the remaining objection that Mr.
24       Blanche noted to Exhibit 408-B, as in boy, as to that one,
25       we believe your Honor has already ruled that evidence of

1       A    Yes.
2       Q    Is this -- can you tell what social media platform
3   this is from?
4       A    Yes.  This is from Truth Social.
5       Q    And what handle was used for this post?
6       A    At Real Donald Trump.
7       Q    What is the date and timestamp shown on the post?
8       A    March 15, 2023 at 11:32 p.m.
9       Q    Can you please read the content of the post to the
10   jury?
11       A    I did nothing wrong in the horseface case.  I see she
12   showed up in New York today trying to drum up some publicity
13   for herself.  I haven't seen or spoken to her -- I haven't seen
14   or spoken to her since I took a picture with her on a golf
15   course in full golf gear, including a hat, close to 18 years
16   ago.
17            She knows nothing about me, other than her conman
18   lawyer Avenatti and convicted lawyer and felon jailbird Michael
19   Cohen may have schemed up.
20            Never had an affair with her.  Just another false
21   acquisition by a sleazebag.  Witch hunt.
22       Q    And, finally, can we show People's Exhibit 408-B,
23   already in evidence to the jury?
24            Is this another Truth Social post that you retrieved?
25       A    Yes.

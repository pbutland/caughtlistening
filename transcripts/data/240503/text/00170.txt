H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo
2204
1   What are you talking about? What statement?
2       I didn't know what he was talking about, and I didn't want
3   to know.
4       So, I -- I understand what I believe he's implying, which
5   is that: I had a statement from Stormy Daniels saying there was
6   no affair; therefore, no story to shop.
7       Q    And when you say you didn't know and you didn't want
8   to know, what do you mean by that?
9       A    The election was taking place in three days, and we
10   were doing five or six rallies a day. There was a lot going on.
11       And, you know, it wasn't like this story was consuming the
12   news cycle and that I needed to be, um, aware of every little
13   detail.
14       I just kind of was hoping at this point we were just gonna
15   blow past it and keep going.
16                 MR. COLANGELO:  Let's take that down and show the
17        rest of the messages on this page.
18       Q    Ms. Hicks, were you in touch with Mr. Cohen again
19   later that day, on November 5th?
20                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Can you describe the text exchange that follows?
23       A    I've texted Michael, and I asked him for David
24   Pecker's cell phone number. And I said:  "I have it, but
25   Mr. Trump thinks it's the wrong number."

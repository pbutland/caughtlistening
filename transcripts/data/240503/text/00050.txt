1 Q Is there a difference when evidence is collected
2 pursuant to a search warrant and when it's collected pursuant to
3 a Consent form?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Can you tell us a little bit about what that is?
6 A Well, a Consent form is just simply a user is offering
7 their phones, they provide the code and we can perform the full
8 extraction of that device.
9 Q And what about when there is a search warrant?
10 A In a search warrant, you may not have the code. It may
11 be a hostile environment.
12 You have to, depending on exigent circumstances, do things
13 to a device with that search warrant that you may not from a
14 Consent form, different things.
15 Q And with a search warrant, the phone is often taken not
16 with the Consent form of the owner, if the phone is taken
17 pursuant to a Court order; is that correct?
18 A That's correct.
19 Q I want to go back to, again, the recording that we
20 played at the end of the day yesterday that had the defendant
21 speaking to Mr. Cohen, the evidence in this case that's in as
22 People's 246.
23 In the examination that you did —— first of all, you were
24 working with a full forensic extraction of the device; is that
25 right?

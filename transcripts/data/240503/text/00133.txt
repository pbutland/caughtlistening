H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo
2167
1                 THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.
2       Q    Did you speak to Michael Cohen around the time the
3   Access Hollywood tape was released?
4       A    I spoke to Michael on Saturday, October 8th.
5       Q    What was the substance of your conversation with
6   Mr. Cohen?
7       A    Um, I was calling to ask him to chase down a rumor I
8   had heard with a contact he was familiar with in the media.
9       Q    And, without giving me any details at all, can you
10   say, very generally, what that rumor was?
11       A    Um, just that there may be another tape that would be
12   problematic for the campaign.
13       Q    When you reached out to Mr. Cohen to ask for his help
14   bringing down that rumor, were you following up, in part,
15   because of the Access Hollywood tape?
16       A    Yes. Of course.
17       I -- I didn't want anyone to be blind-sided. I wanted to
18   have an understanding of, you know, what material was out there
19   that we needed to prepare for.
20       Q    And what, if anything, did you ask Mr. Cohen to do?
21       A    Um, I asked him to call this friend of his and ask
22   about the existence of the tape, and then let me know if there
23   was, in fact, a tape, what was on it, and when we could expect
24   it to be published.
25       Q    Okay.

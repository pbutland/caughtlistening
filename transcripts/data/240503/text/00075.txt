G. Longstreet — Direct/Mangold
2109
1 type of evidence for two purposes:
2 First, to offset the Defense claims that
3 witnesses are benefiting from a willingness to testify.
4 And second, to explain witnesses’ initial denials
5 as to certain events in this case.
6 THE COURT: And it’s offered as the exception to
7 hearsay?
8 MS. MANGOLD: Admission.
9 THE COURT: So, the People are withdrawing 405—A.
10 407—A through E are Twitter posts. They are
11 coming in as admissions.
12 408—A is a Truth Social post. It’s coming in as
13 an admission.
14 408—B is coming in as an admission. 1 am
15 satisfied, again, as to reliability.
16 And going back to my earlier ruling, if you go
17 back to the motions in limine, I had ruled that we would
18 take this up later, that we would have to wait and see what
19 happens.
20 I had not at that time decided that these types
21 of things could come in. However, I subsequently ruled
22 that the door had been opened, and based upon that, I am
23 allowing them to come in.
24 All right. Let's get the witness.
25 MS. MANGOLD: Sorry, your Honor.

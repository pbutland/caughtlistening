1   verbally, and we were at the time -- based on the conversation

7       Q.   When you say "you shared the content verbally," did you
8   read Mr. Trump the email you received from Mr. Fahrenthold?
9       A.   I read him the email and I have a vague recollection of
10   starting to read the transcript.  And then he finished reading

17       Q.   Did he ask to see the actual tape?
18       A.   Yes.

20   video?
21       A.   This is where it gets as little fuzzy; I can't remember
22   if we saw the video before it was published or not.  Obviously,
23   we saw the tape in a matter of minutes, whether it was from the
24   reporter directly or when his story posted shortly thereafter.
25       Q.   So at some point you saw the video.  Were you with

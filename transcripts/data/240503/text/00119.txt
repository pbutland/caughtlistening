1 Chris Christie. The whole group, they were practicing for a
2 debate prep.
3 Q. Was Jeff Sessions also present for the debate prep?
4 A. Jeff was there that day at some point. I can't
5 remember if he was there when I went upstairs or if he came a

7 Q. Where on the 25th floor was the debate prep taking
8 place?
9 A. In the conference room.
10 Q. Can you tell the jury a little bit more about what
11 happened when you went upstairs?
12 A. It's a glass conference room. When I get off the
13 elevator, there is sort of a waiting area, but you can see into
14 the conference room, and everyone can see out of the conference
15 room.
16 So I motioned for Jason, a couple of people I sent the
17 email to come out and speak to me, to try not to disrupt the
18 debate prep.
19 And, obviously, the sight of the six of us kind of
20 gathered, five or six of us gathered out there, was a sign that,
21 you know, something was afoot. And Mr. Trump asked us to come
22 into the conference room at some point and share with him what
23 we were discussing.
24 Q. Tell the jury what happened next?
25 A. You know, I shared the email with Mr. Trump. Sort of

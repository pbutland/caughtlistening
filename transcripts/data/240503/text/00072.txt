1                 Let's go to 407.
2                 MR. BLANCHE:  Beginning with 407-A, so here, your
3       Honor, this would be, presumably, offered for -- again,
4       everything on this document, there is, I think you can see
5       at the bottom, there is the date that it was posted.  The
6       time that it was posted.  That's an out of court statement
7       being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.
8                 THE COURT:  And let's look at B.
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  This is exactly the same thing.
10                 Your Honor, just to be clear, I don't know
11       whether they are going to argue it, but there is a lot of
12       information in here including reposts, quotes, likes,
13       bookmarks, date, time.
14                 THE COURT:  And 407-A through E are these all
15       Truth Social posts?
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, it is.
17                 I am sorry.  They are tweets.
18                 MS. MANGOLD:  They are all Twitter posts.
19                 THE COURT:  What are you introducing these for?
20                 MS. MANGOLD:  We are introducing them for the
21       content of the statements made, as well as who they were
22       made by and the time and date that they were posted.
23                 We do not need to admit the markings on the
24       bottom which indicate requotes, posts, likes and bookmarks.
25                 THE COURT:  Okay.  Very well.

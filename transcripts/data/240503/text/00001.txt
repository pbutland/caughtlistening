10                MR. BOVE:  Good morning.  Emil Bove for Donald
11       Trump, who is seated to my left.
12                And I am joined with Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles
13       and Kendra Wharton.
14                THE COURT:  Good morning, everyone.
15                Before we put the witness on the stand, there is
16       one issue that I did want to clarify.
17                And I'm addressing this to Mr. Trump.
18                It came to my attention that there may be a
19       misunderstanding regarding the Order restricting
20       extrajudicial statements and how it impacts upon Mr. Trump's
21       right to testify at trial.
22                I think it's important that I clear up any
23       misunderstanding that might exist.
24                I want to stress, Mr. Trump, that you have an
25       absolute right to testify at trial, if that is what you

1 that given your Honor’s ruling this morning, assuming you
2 overruled our hearsay objection, we would just like the
3 opportunity to speak with our client, and amongst ourselves
4 about the stipulation, which we haven’t got a chance to do.
5 THE COURT: Do you want to take a minute to do
6 that now?
7 MR. BLANCHE: Sure.
8 THE COURT: You want to step out for a few
9 minutes?
10 MR. BLANCHE: Yes.
11 (Short recess is taken.)
12 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche.
13 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we continue to have our
14 hearsay objection.
15 Assuming that’s overruled, we have agreed with
16 the People to a stipulation, and we have agreed to it.
17 It’s going to, assuming the Court allows this, we
18 will just read it to the jury. Then we will type it up and
19 mark it as an exhibit.
20 THE COURT: That's fine.
21 Now, can we pull up the exhibits that you have a
22 hearsay exception to?
23 I just want to look at them quickly.
24 MR. BLANCHE: Sure.
25 THE COURT: Let’s go one by one.

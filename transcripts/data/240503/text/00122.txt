H. Hicks - Direct/Colangelo

1       A.   Yes, I think there was consensus among us all that the
2   tape was damaging and this was a crisis.
3       Q.   Were you concerned at the time about the effect that
4   that Access Hollywood tape would have on the female voters?
5       A.   In that moment, no.  You know, maybe a couple of hours
6   later something that crossed my mind, maybe the next day.  But
7   just trying to get your bearings in a moment like that, there is
8   a lot going on.  Not in that moment, but certainly eventually
9   that was something that was raised.
10       Q.   At some point, did the conversation turn to how the
11   campaign should respond?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Tell the jury a little bit more about that discussion?
14       A.   I don't really have a strong recollection of that
15   conversation.  But, you know, I know Mr. Trump felt like this
16   wasn't good.  But it was also just like two guys talking
17   privately, locker room talk.  It wasn't anything to get so upset
18   over.  Certainly he didn't want to offend anybody, but I think
19   he felt like this was like pretty standard stuff for two guys
20   chatting with each other.
21       Q.   And so, as you developed an initial campaign response,
22   did Mr. Trump have thoughts on what that initial campaign
23   response should be?
24       A.   He did.  He always liked to weigh in on responses.
25       Q.   Did you prepare a short written statement in response?

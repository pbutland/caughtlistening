1       Q    And so, in that conversation you just testified about,
2   he wanted to hear what Mr. Pecker's statement to The Wall
3   Street Journal would be?
4       A    He wanted to have an understanding of what David had
5   told me previously.
6       Q    Did that include what Mr. Pecker told you about what
7   the explanation would be?
8       A    It included his explanation for that; that this was a
9   legitimate contract, and that's what they planned to tell The
10   Journal.
11       Q    You said Mr. Trump then had input into the statement;
12   is that right?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    Did he ask you to include anything in the comment to
15   the reporter?
16       A    Um, I think we -- we changed the statement not to
17   include almost any of what you just saw; and it was just the --
18   a denial and -- of the accusations and a statement that they
19   were totally untrue and that we didn't know anything about
20   this, this deal.
21       Q    Going back to the email you received from The Wall
22   Street Journal reporter, did it mention any other women in
23   addition to Karen McDougal?
24       A    The story was also going to mention Stephanie
25   Clifford, Stormy Daniels, one in the same.

G. Longstreet — Direct/Mangold
2107
1 And just to back up a little bit, I am satisfied
2 with the foundation that the witness laid as far as
3 reliability.
4 You know, we will take each exhibit one at a
5 time.
6 But, overall, I think that the foundation was
7 laid for establishing whose account it was, how she
8 determined that, and what steps she took.
9 Ultimately, the issue of hearsay is, is it
10 reliable. And for purposes of, at least having this
11 discussion, and whether I am going to accept each
12 individual exhibit, I am satisfied that it is reliable.
13 What’s 408—A?
14 MR. BLANCHE: I mean, this is now Truth, your
15 Honor. It is same exact objection.
16 They are going to say to the jury at some point
17 on March 15, 2023, this Truth was sent and it is a business
18 record. It’s being offered for the truth.
19 And there is a specific rule, which is 808, that
20 doesn’t allow it to come in this way, with a witness who
21 hasn’t said a word about her experience or how the business
22 maintains these records.
23 MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, again, we are not
24 seeking to admit this as a business record. We are seeking
25 to admit this as a party admission.

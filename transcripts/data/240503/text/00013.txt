1                They may want to have something more physical,
2       something more persuasive than just the witness having their
3       memory refreshed --
4                MR. BLANCHE:  It's also in the email, your Honor.
5                THE COURT:  -- more than just having their memory
6       refreshed.
7                You can sort it out.
8                I think the People can establish and should
9       establish the date of the tape, and they should be given the
10       opportunity to do that.
11                I don't want this picture to come in, okay.
12                MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you, your Honor.
13                MS. MANGOLD:  Thank you, your Honor.
14                THE COURT:  Thank you.  Let's get the witness,
15       please.
16                MR. CONROY:  Judge, can we approach very briefly on
17       an issue related to the witness on the stand?
18                THE COURT:  Sure.
19                *******
20                (AT SIDEBAR.)
21                MR. CONROY:  I just wanted to raise, so they handed
22       us exhibits yesterday, including what they have marked as G1
23       and G2, which are internal emails from the District
24       Attorney's office that relate to Jeremy Rosenberg.
25                They are basically HR emails about the issues

1       Who was authorized to post from the @realDonaldTrump
2   Twitter account?
3       A    Mr. Trump.
4       And I think there was just one other -- one other staff
5   member that, um, could post things that Mr. Trump approved.
6       Q    Who was that staff member?
7       A    His name is Dan Scavino.
8       Q    And he was authorized to post things, only with
9   Mr. Trump's approval?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    So, any language on a Twitter post in this time period
12   is Mr. Trump's language, either he posted or approved it?
13                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
14                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
15       A    That's my understanding, yes.
16       Q    We discussed earlier the response of some elected
17   officials to the Access Hollywood tape.
18       Do you know what Mr. Trump's reaction was to some of those
19   incidents?
20       A    Yeah. I think he was frustrated.
21       But, again, it was not unusual to have any of those
22   individuals speaking out and saying negative things about
23   Mr. Trump, especially in response to, you know, controversy.
24   That was pretty -- pretty typical.
25                 MR. COLANGELO:  Can we show People's 407B in

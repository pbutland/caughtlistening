H. Hicks — Direct/Colangelo

1 into the political work, I met with him more regularly.
2 Q. As your experience at The Trump Organization grew and
3 as you began working on both Trump Organization matters and
4 campaign matters, eventually how often did you come to meet
5 with him in a typical day?
6 A. I probably met with him every day.
7 Q. And were those scheduled meetings, unscheduled
8 meetings, or both?
9 A. Both.
10 Q. Were you ever called into Mr. Trump's office when he
11 was meeting with other people?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Give us an example of how that might come about?
14 A. You know, he's just the kind of person —— he is a very
15 good multitasker and a very hard worker. He is always doing
16 many things at once. He might be having a conversation with
17 someone and it will remind him to follow up on something else.
18 He'll want to share something with the group that he is
19 meeting with and want to provide them with —— maybe if it's a
20 political meeting, he wants to provide them with poll numbers.
21 If it's a real estate meeting, he will want to provide them with
22 any positive press surrounding the property, the sales of the
23 property, the value of the property, things like that.
24 Q. In this period of time, 2015, was it unusual for you to
25 be in and out of his office during other meetings?

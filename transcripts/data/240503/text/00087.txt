Jury Trial — Colloquy
2121
1 MR. BOVE: Judge, there is one evidentiary
2 objection.
3 THE COURT: No speaking objections.
4 MR. BOVE: May I approach?
5 THE COURT: Sure.
6 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
7 record.)
8 MR. BOVE: Thank you.
9 Judge, I am sorry.
10 We want to put on the record our objection on
11 Presidential immunity grounds. I expect there will be
12 testimony from Ms. Hicks related to statements by President
13 Trump while he was President of the United States.
14 Unless you tell me it is necessary, I prefer not
15 to lodge the objections question by question.
16 We object to the subject of her testimony based
17 on the authorities we submitted, and our position being
18 that that testimony is evidence of official acts being
19 presented at a criminal trial against the President, and it
20 should be precluded.
21 MR. COLANGELO: I don’t anticipate we will be
22 showing any exhibits that fall within that category.
23 We intend to elicit testimony, and we have
24 briefed at length the argument that the rule of
25 inadmissibility that Mr. Bove just described does not exist

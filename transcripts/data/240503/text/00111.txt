2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Do you remember when that was?
4 A. July 19th of 2016.
5 Q. And so moving forward in time from the July 2016 period
6 to the Fall, were you still Press Secretary for the campaign?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Had your responsibilities changed since the beginning
9 of the campaign?
10 A. Just a little bit because we had more people to be
11 helpful. So there were more hands on deck. It wasn't just a
12 solo operation. But in terms of my role with Mr. Trump, nothing
13 had changed.
14 Q. So how frequently were you interacting with Mr. Trump
15 during this time period?
16 Now we're in the Fall of 2016.
17 A. We were travelling every day for the campaign.
18 Q. Describe for the jury what a typical day was like in
19 this time period?
20 A. Sure.
21 So we were based here in New York, and we would usually
22 leave Trump Tower at about 7 in the morning. We would go to
23 La Guardia and get on Mr. Trump's plane and we could make, you
24 know, somewhere between two and four, sometimes five stops in a
25 day. Typically a couple of rallies and then maybe one or two

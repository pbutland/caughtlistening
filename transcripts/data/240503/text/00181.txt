1   Communications Director. This was a major interview. Yes. We
2   just spoke about the news coverage of the interview, how it was
3   playing out.
4       But, I don't recall him mentioning Mr. Pecker in those
5   conversations or having a conversation with Mr. Pecker.
6       Q    And, when did you -- you testified that you left the
7   White House after an initial period of -- when was that
8   relative to the events I just described?
9       A    Five days later.
10       Q    Did there -- did there come a time during your White
11   House employment that the Stormy Daniels story surfaced?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    When was that?
14       A    January 12, 2018.
15       Q    Describe how you -- describe how you learned that the
16   story was coming back.
17       A    I can't remember exactly, but, um, someone -- either
18   myself or another press communications team member -- got an
19   inquiry from the same reporter, Michael Rothfeld, of The Wall
20   Street Journal, describing a story they planned to publish
21   that, you know, Stormy Daniels, who was a footnote in the
22   November 4th story from the previous year, had, in fact,
23   received a payment of $130,000.
24       Q    So, you first heard about it before the story was
25   posted; and later the article was published; right?

3       A    I do.
4       Q    What -- for a cell phone, what is a factory reset?
5       A    A factory reset is when you, let's say, got a new
6   phone, you want to retire your -- this particular phone, you can
7   go in and set -- many of you perhaps have iPhones -- you can
8   actually go in and do a reset so it resets the phone back to the
9   factory settings.
10       Q    And the factory reset setting can also be used to
11   essentially delete user data from a phone; correct?
12       A    That is correct.

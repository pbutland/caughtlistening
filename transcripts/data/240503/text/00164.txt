1   to be certain words were included.
2       These are hectic conversations. There's a lot of people
3   weighing in.
4       I just want to say something definitively that I can't
5   remember as I sit here right now.
6       Sorry.
7                 MR. COLANGELO:  We can take that down.
8                 Let's go back to People's 180, please.
9                 Can you display the middle of Page 4.
10                 Let's blow up the passage -- this can go to

12                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
13       Q    Do you see the passage that's being displayed?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Does that read: "Mr. Davidson also represented
16   Stephanie Clifford, a former adult film star whose professional
17   name is Stormy Daniels and who was in discussions with ABC's
18   Good Morning America in recent months publicly disclose what
19   she said was a past relationship with Mr. Trump, according to
20   people familiar with the talks. Ms. Clifford cut off contact
21   with the network without telling her story. She didn't respond
22   to requests for comment. An ABC spokesperson declined to
23   comment on Ms. McDougal or Ms. Clifford. The Trump spokeswoman,
24   Ms. Hicks, said it was 'absolutely, unequivocally untrue' about
25   that Stormy Daniels had a relationship with Mr. Trump."

3                 MR. COLANGELO:  I offer People's 313 into
4        evidence.
5                 MR. BOVE:  No objection.
6                 THE COURT:  People's 313 is accepted into
7        evidence.
8                 (Whereupon, People's Exhibit 313 was received into
9        evidence.)

13       Q.   Ms. Hicks, is this the written statement that you just
14   mentioned?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   When was it issued?
17       A.   Sometime in the afternoon.  If I got the query at 1:30,
18   the story was being posted by 3:30.  I think it went out
19   sometime between 3:30 and 4 o'clock, if I had to guess.
20       Q.   Can you read the statement, please.
21       A.   Sure.
22            It says:  "This was locker room banter.  A private
23   conversation that took place many years ago.  Bill Clinton has
24   said far worse to me on the golf course.  Not even close.  I
25   apologize to anyone who is offended."

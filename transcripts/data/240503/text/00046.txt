1       A    To make a recording.
2       Q    And you don't know what he was doing; do you?
3       A    I do not.
4       Q    And this is far from ideal, from a forensic
5   perspective, if you are trying to determine in a reliable
6   fashion what went on with this phone in 2016; correct?
7       A    If something happened in 2016 on the device, that file
8   is going to be saved on that device.
9       Q    Right.  And this phone has been synced multiple times,
10   turned on and off since that time, all sorts of things have
11   happened that create variables that in your ideal situation
12   would be investigated; correct?
13       A    Certainly.
14       Q    Including this laptop that Michael Cohen had, what's on
15   it, what got loaded onto the phone; right?
16       Those are questions from your perspective?
17                MR. CONROY:  Objection.
18                THE COURT:  Sustained.
19       Q    The things that I've shown you this morning raise some
20   questions about how this phone was handled; right?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And this phone was not handled, through no -- no fault
23   of your own, you took possession of this phone in January 2023;
24   right?
25       A    That's correct.  2023.

1 A I did.
2 Q Around this time, on November 4th, did you witness any
3 phone conversations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen?
4 A Um, I believe —— I believe I heard Mr. Trump speaking
5 with Mr. Cohen shortly after the story was published.
6 Q Did you ——
7 A In addition to the phone calls that I described
8 earlier.
9 Q Okay.
10 Thank you.
11 And when you observed Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen speaking
12 after the story was published, did you participate in that
13 conversation?
14 A No.
15 We were in our car on our way to a rally venue.
16 Q Tell the jury a little bit more about how that came to
17 be.
18 A We had landed. After Ohio, we flew to, I think,
19 Hershey, Pennsylvania. And so, we were getting in cars at the
20 airport to travel to the next event venue.
21 And I don’t know who initiated the phone call. I just
22 remember Mr. Trump was speaking to Michael during that car
23 ride, and Reince Priebus was also in the car.
24 Q And did you hear either side of that conversation?
25 A Um, I, presumably, heard Mr. Trump.

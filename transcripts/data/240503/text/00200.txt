1       Q.   And so there was an in-person meeting to discuss how to
2   react to this news article; right?
3       A.   That's right.
4       Q.   That concept of gathering the key campaign staff and
5   the President to talk about an issue that could impact the
6   campaign, that was standard for the way you were all operating
7   at the time; right?
8       A.   I mean, most often when we were on the road, it was
9   just whoever was with us.
10       Q.   Right?
11       A.   It was unusual to be at Trump Tower.
12       Q.   And what was unusual about it is that, for once, out of
13   all that time you were actually in New York, not on the road,
14   people had gathered for the debate prep; right?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   You recall, don't you, there was some leaks of
17   President Trump's tax information prior to this?
18       A.   I think just before the first debate.
19       Q.   And in connection with that, the campaign staff
20   gathered to talk about how to respond with the President, right,
21   either physically or on the phone?
22       A.   That's my recollection, yes.
23       Q.   And that Friday night into the Saturday morning, people
24   worked pretty late; right?
25       A.   Yes.

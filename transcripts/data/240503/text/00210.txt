1        what your Honor has already ruled, that if President Trump
2        testifies, he can be cross-examined on a prior finding by a
3        different Judge, in a different court on this issue.
4                 So, to the extent that the People want to expose
5        President Trump and cross examine him on that issue,
6        they're going to do it.
7                 For those reasons, we do not think it's
8        appropriate to allow the People to cross-examine President
9        Trump.
10                 THE COURT:  Thank you.
11                 MR. COLANGELO:  Thank you.
12                 On the last point that Mr. Blanche just raised, as
13        your Honor noted in your original Sandoval ruling, the
14        Court analysis is not bound by the number of the
15        defendant's prior convictions.
16                 That's People v. Gray.
17                 And, so, in fact, the Courts have discretion to
18        permit inquiry into the defendant's entire criminal
19        history.
20                 Here, the Court's findings of nine criminal
21        contempts are directly relevant to the defendant's
22        credibility.  They're finding that the defendant
23        intentionally violated the Court Order.
24                 Both the Court of Appeals and the First Department
25        have expressly held that contempt findings are appropriate

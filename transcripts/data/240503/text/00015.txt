1                I don't have a problem with you wanting to impeach
2       Mr. Rosenberg.  But I don't think that this is the right way
3       to do it.
4                You can ask the witness:  Who did you get the phone
5       from?  Who retrieved the phone?  Who gave it to you?  If you
6       would like that on the record that it was Mr. Rosenberg and
7       you can you ask him specific questions about the timing of
8       all that, but you can't show him HR documents.
9                MR. BOVE:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you
10       off.
11                THE COURT:  It's all right.
12                MR. BOVE:  I don't plan to show him the documents
13       or to try and refresh him in any way.
14                I would ask permission to put questions to him
15       along the lines:  Are you aware that Mr. Rosenberg was
16       disciplined on this basis?
17                THE COURT:  I don't think that's appropriate.
18                MR. BOVE:  If I could hand up --
19                THE COURT:  Sure.
20                MR. BOVE:  This is the Court of Appeals in People
21       v. Baez.
22                (Handed.)
23                MR. BOVE:  And I'm focused on the language of --
24       beginning with Subsection 2 that talks about the defense's
25       ability to impeach on the basis of the gaps just like this.

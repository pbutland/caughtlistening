Proceedings

1                 I agree with Mr. Blanche.  I think for a jury to
2        hear that this Court, the same Judge that is presiding over
3        this case has found Mr. Trump to be in contempt on this
4        case, I think would be so prejudicial, it would be very,
5        very difficult for a jury to look past that.
6                 So, I agree with Mr. Blanche, and I am going to
7        deny the People's application to go into that.
8                 Anything else?
9                 MR. STEINGLASS:  One more thing that is
10        outstanding.  We had handed up, last week, a draft
11        instruction on redactions.  I don't think it's particularly
12        controversial.  We don't want the jury speculating about
13        why some of these exhibits are so heavily redacted.
14                 I have another copy, if you your Honor wants it.
15        Or, you still have it?
16                 THE COURT:  I have it.
17                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Give it sooner rather than later.
18        We have been displaying a lot of exhibits that are heavily
19        redacted.  We plan to do more of that.  And I just think
20        this relatively benign instruction is not going to hurt
21        anyone other than preventing undue speculation on the part
22        of the jury.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  No objection.
24                 THE COURT:  So, I will take care of that on
25        Monday.

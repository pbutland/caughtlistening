1 some of this type of evidence at this trial, which is why
2 I didn’t object to the first three or four.
3 My objection at this point is that it’s
4 cumulative and unduly prejudicial.
5 So, we object to further questioning the party on
6 public reactions to the Access Hollywood tape.
7 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, public reaction to
8 the Access Hollywood tape is a critical part of the
9 evidence in the case. We not only briefed it, but it’s
10 important to show the impact on the campaign.
11 THE COURT: I agree.
12 I think that you’ve gone pretty far along on
13 this.
14 What do you expect to elicit from this meeting?
15 MR. COLANGELO: That the Speaker of the House
16 told other members of the Caucus that they were free to
17 cut loose from Mr. Trump and free to endorse or not
18 endorse, as they see fit.
19 MR. BOVE: This is all hearsay.
20 If we’re going to probe that call, I would ask it
21 happen outside the presence of the jurors and they don’t
22 hear the call.
23 THE COURT: I’ll sustain the objection.
24 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
25 in open court:)

1   Mr. Trump when at that happened?
2       A.   Yes.
3       Q.   Was Mr. Trump upset?
4       A.   Yes.  Yes, he was.
5       Q.   Fair to say he was as mad as you've ever seen him?
6                 MR. BOVE:  Objection, Judge.
7                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
8       Q.   What was your first reaction when you heard the tape?
9       A.   Just a little stunned.  Just -- it's hard to describe.
10   It's hard to describe.  Yeah, it was definitely concerning, and
11   I had, you know, a good sense that this was going to be a
12   massive story and sort of dominate the news cycle for the next
13   several days at least.
14       Q.   Were you concerned about the effect it would have on
15   the campaign?
16       A.   Yes, it was a damaging development.
17       Q.   Why was it a damaging development?
18       A.   It just didn't feel like the kind of -- it just didn't
19   feel like the kind of story -- it, obviously, wasn't helpful.
20   But there were a lot of layers to it that complicated where we
21   were trying to go with the campaign.  This was kind of pulling
22   us backwards in a way that was going to be hard to overcome.
23       Q.   In those initial conversations with Mr. Trump and other
24   campaign staff, did anyone else in the group express concern
25   that the tape would be damaging?

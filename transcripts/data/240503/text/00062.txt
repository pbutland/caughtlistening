5       A    Every day.  Usually, multiple times a day.
6       Q    That's for the year-and-a-half that you have been on

17       Q    Can you describe that for the jury, please?
18       A    Sure.
19            So, I use a tool that we have called Snagit, which is,
20   basically, just a way to screenshot something on the computer,
21   take a screenshot of whatever the post is, and then I save that
22   file to a folder, usually with the date and a few words about
23   what the post is about, and then I hash it.
24       Q    Can you explain what hashing is for the jury?
25       A    Sure.

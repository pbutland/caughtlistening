1   there were only six stories.
2       Um, and -- and he wrote back saying that: "Even CNN wasn't
3   talking about it. No one believes it. And if necessary, I have
4   a statement by storm denying everything and contradicting the
5   other porn star's statement. I wouldn't use it now or even
6   discuss with him as no one is talking about this or cares."
7       And I responded: "Agree."
8       Q    Can you describe what you understood "getting little
9   to no traction" to mean?
10       A    It wasn't being picked up in the same way as something
11   like the Access Hollywood tape was. It wasn't wall-to-wall
12   coverage.
13       Q    And in the message on the middle of your screen right
14   now, there's a note from Mr. Cohen, stating he "has a message
15   from storm".
16       A    I see it.
17       Q    What do you understand that to mean?
18       A    I don't -- I don't know.
19       Q    Do you have any understanding at all?
20       A    I mean, I can guess.
21       But, when I say I don't know, I don't believe at the time I
22   received that message that I had the necessary context to
23   totally understand what he was talking about. Um, but, it
24   wasn't -- I just wanted to move to the next thing.
25       It wasn't -- obviously, I didn't follow up and say: Wait.

1 A. Yes.
2 Q. But still interacting with the press?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Helping to put together statements; correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And let's focus on the period 2015 to 2016 for a little
7 bit. Mr. Cohen wasn't a part of the campaign; right?
8 A. No. He would try to insert himself at certain moments,
9 but he wasn't supposed to be on the campaign in any official
10 capacity. There were some things he did in a voluntary capacity
11 because of his interest. He would sometimes appear on TV.
12 I think he put together a coalition, a diversity coalition at
13 one point.
14 No, no, he wasn't looped in on the day—to—day of the
15 campaign strategy, staff, the plans, no.
16 Q. The campaign had separate counsel, separate lawyers?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And that included Don McGahn?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And you mentioned that had Mr. Cohen made some of the
21 statements and did some TV appearances during the campaign,
22 right?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And am I correct that he was instructed to focus on
25 President Trump's business credentials; right?

Proceedings

1       surrounding Jeremy Rosenberg.
2                This witness has never seen these documents.  He
3       has no -- he would have no knowledge of them.
4                You know, he may have met Jeremy Rosenberg at some
5       point.
6                He doesn't know Jeremy Rosenberg.  So I just want
7       to be very careful, I mean, my view is they shouldn't be in
8       any way read into the record or anything.
9                I guess if they wanted to show them to the witness
10       and ask him if he has ever seen them, maybe they can do
11       that.
12                MR. BOVE:  So we seek to ask the witness the
13       questions to impeach the chain of custody on the two devices
14       that he has testified about.
15                And so, what I would like -- and Mr. Rosenberg is
16       the person who turned the phones over to HTAU for both
17       phones.
18                There was a delay in the period of time between
19       when he picked the phones up and when he dropped them off.
20       For one of the phones it was about four days.  For another
21       one it was overnight.
22                That was part of the reason that Mr. Rosenberg is
23       the --
24                THE COURT:  I understand why you want to impeach
25       him.

1       witness, but I do believe that we will have some evidentiary
2       objections to what we believe will be the next witness,
3       which we can handle now or after this witness, which ever.
4                THE COURT:  Why don't you start.
5                MR. BLANCHE:  Sure.
6                So we understand that the next witness is a summary
7       witness and intends to get in a number of exhibits that we
8       have -- business records -- foundational objections to for
9       all of them.
10                But then we have other objections for three of
11       them, your Honor.
12                So the first one, I can start with the business
13       records exemption.
14                So we understand that the proffered evidence
15       include two Truths, alleged Truths by President Trump; a
16       handful of tweets by President Trump; and a tweet by the
17       Washington Post; and then a news article by the Washington
18       Post.
19                We believe there are hearsay problems with each of
20       these exhibits without the proper business record foundation
21       being laid.
22                So with respect to the Truths, it may be that by a
23       preponderance of the evidence, the statement -- that the
24       Truth itself could be allowed into evidence without a
25       statement of the defendant.

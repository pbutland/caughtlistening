D. Daus - Cross/Bove
2071
1   recording was made.
2       In this case, it would have been 2016, so September 6th at
3   approximately 10:56.
4       So wherever that file existed on an iPhone associated with
5   that account got restored, as mentioned before, back onto this
6   device.
7       One of the columns you look at is that source file
8   information.  When that comes over from the backup, you will see
9   the same date and time.
10       If that recording was modified or edited at some point
11   later, and adding something or deleting something, you would
12   then have timestamps that reflect that time it was edited, but
13   in this case, this particular file shows the same metadata
14   information about the time.
15                MR. BOVE:  Judge, I move to strike all of that as
16       nonresponsive.
17                THE COURT:  Overruled.
18       Q    You just testified about your theories of the timestamp
19   on the screen; right?
20       A    I did.
21       Q    That is your hypothesis; correct?
22       A    It's my experience, yes.
23       Q    And, look, you have a ton of experience with forensic
24   science; right?
25       A    Yes.

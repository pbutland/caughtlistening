1       A    Sometimes.
2       Q    Meaning sometimes only one member of the District
3   Attorney's office collects the phone; is that right?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    And in that situation, like the one we have here with
6   CP1, there is only one witness who knows what happened during
7   that collection process; right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    Well, there is one witness from the District Attorney's
10   office?
11       A    One signature.
12       Q    Mr. Rosenberg.  And then there is another witness,
13   Michael Cohen; right?
14       A    That's correct.
15       Q    And the reason that is not an ideal way to handle it in
16   this fashion is that if there is a dispute about what happened
17   during the acquisition, it's sort of what Mr. Rosenberg said
18   versus what Mr. Cohen said; right?
19       A    Theoretically.
20       Q    And so, the reason that there is a second witness space
21   on that form is that in an ideal situation, from a forensic
22   perspective, you would have two witnesses in a position to say,
23   this is what happened when I picked up the phone?
24       A    Ideally.
25       Q    And we don't have that here?

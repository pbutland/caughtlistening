1       But, at some point in the aftermath of that story, I spoke
2   to him, I spoke to him about it. And I do remember that.
3       Q    What do you remember about that conversation?
4       A    I remember Michael just, um, saying that this wasn't
5   true, that no payment had been made, and that he had a
6   statement from Stormy Daniels, either personally or her
7   attorney, stating that no relationship had transpired.
8       Q    And --
9       A    And that he had documentation to prove that -- that no
10   payment had been made.
11       Q    I think you testified a minute ago that you also
12   discussed this story with Mr. Trump; is that right?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    And what did you discuss with Mr. Trump?
15       A    Just how to respond to the story, how he would like a
16   team to respond to the story.
17       Q    Did you relay to him the substance of the conversation
18   you had with Mr. Cohen?
19       A    I don't recall the sequencing, and I believe I spoke
20   to Mr. Cohen after I spoke to Mr. Trump.
21                 MR. COLANGELO:  Let's bring up People's 181 in
22        evidence.
23                 This can be displayed to everybody.

25       Q    Is this the article we were just discussing?

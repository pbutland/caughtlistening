G. Longstreet - Direct/Mangold
2101
1       Q    Did you take any steps to verify if that Truth Social
2   handle was associated with Mr. Trump?
3       A    On Mr. Trump's campaign site there is a Truth Social
4   icon that links directly back to that Truth Social account.
5       Q    And are you familiar with the website called The
6   Wayback Machine?
7       A    I am.
8       Q    Can you describe what that is to the jury?
9       A    Yes.  So, The Wayback Machine is a digital archive.  I
10   think it was founded in like 2001 or something.  And it,
11   basically, allows users to, essentially, go back in time and
12   see what a website looked like on any day in the past.
13       Q    Can you explain to the jury how you find a particular
14   website from a particular point in time?
15       A    Yes.  So, the way that I do it, for example, I take
16   that website's current viewer, the way it shows up if you were
17   to look it up today, and I enter it into The Way Back Machine
18   search engine, and it will allow you to view the different
19   months or days or years in the past that it has preserved that
20   website's content on.  And then you can choose which day of the
21   past you would like to view.
22       Q    In connection with this case, did you ever use The
23   Wayback Machine to retrieve previously posted versions of news
24   articles?
25       A    I did.

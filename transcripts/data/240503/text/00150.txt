1       Q    Did you begin drafting a response from the campaign to
2   respond to The Wall Street Journal reporter?
3       A    I did.
4       Q    Did you share that draft response with anyone before
5   sending it to The Wall Street Journal?
6       A    I sent it to Michael first, just to get his input,
7   while Mr. Trump was still on stage.
8       And then, when Mr. Trump came off -- came on the plane from
9   the rally, I shared it with him as well.
10       Q    And when you say you "shared it with him as well",
11   you're referring to sharing it with Mr. Trump as well?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    After you sent it to Mr. Cohen; is that right?
14       A    Yes.
15                 MR. COLANGELO:  Let's display just for the
16        witness, Counsel, and the Court a document marked for
17        identification as People's 318.
18                 (Whereupon, the aforementioned parties are shown
19        the exhibit on their screens.)
20       Q    Once you review that, let me know if you recognize
21   that document.
22       A    Yes. I recognize it.
23       Q    Let's -- I'm sorry.
24       You said you recognize the document?
25       A    I do.

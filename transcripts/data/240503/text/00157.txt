10   BY MR. COLANGELO:
11       Q    Good afternoon, Ms. Hicks.
12       Before lunch, we were talking about an inquiry you got from
13   Michael Rothfeld at The Wall Street Journal; do you remember
14   that discussion?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And I believe we were discussing a request from
17   Mr. Trump that you included the denial of any relationship with
18   Stormy Daniels in your response to The Wall Street Journal; do
19   you remember that?
20       A    With both of the women who were mentioned in the
21   story, yes.
22       Q    Thank you.
23       Did you get back in touch with the reporter, Mr. Rothfeld,
24   at that point, to convey the denial of any relationship with
25   Stormy Daniels?

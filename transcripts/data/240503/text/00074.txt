G. Longstreet - Direct/Mangold
2108
1                 THE COURT:  How do you get past hearsay of the
2       actual statement?
3                 MS. MANGOLD:  We believe, as already mentioned,
4       we believe that the witness we are seeking to admit this
5       through has made an adequate foundation and that there is
6       sufficient hallmarks of reliability.
7                 THE COURT:  What's the exception to hearsay?
8                 MS. MANGOLD:  Admission.
9                 THE COURT:  Okay.
10                 And what's 408-B?
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  This one, your Honor, we have
12       exactly the same hearsay objection.  But actually we have
13       an absolute relevance objection and an unduly prejudicial
14       objection for the reasons I stated this morning for the
15       information provided to the Court.
16                 THE COURT:  What's the relevance of that?
17                 MS. MANGOLD:  So, your Honor, the relevance of
18       this is the pressure that has been put on witnesses in
19       connection with testifying about the case.
20                 This is the same issue that your Honor addressed
21       on Tuesday, when your Honor ruled that -- this is
22       transcript pages 1651 to 1661 that the Defendant had opened
23       the door to arguments and evidence about the pressure
24       campaign that the Defendant put on witnesses.
25                 And your Honor ruled that we could introduce this

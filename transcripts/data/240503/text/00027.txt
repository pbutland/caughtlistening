1 messages very quickly after they are set; right?
2 A You can.
3 Q You can set that up that the message self—deletes when
4 it's read by the other party; right?
5 A That’s correct.
6 Q And in that instance, it would be virtually possible
7 for someone in your position to recover data on the phone
8 relating to those messages; correct?
9 A That’s correct.
10 Q Now, I want to talk about the data you extracted from
11 CP1, okay?
12 A Yes.
13 Q You testified yesterday that you did not obtain copies
14 of the data that the FBI had seized from this same device;
15 right?
16 A I had not.
17 Q And we talked about hash values yesterday; correct?
18 A That’s correct.
19 Q And so, in the absence of having that other copy, you
20 couldn’t compare the hashes to see if the data had been
21 manipulated; correct?
22 A That’s correct.
23 Q You could not compare the two different data sets to
24 determine if the data had degraded between 2018 and 2023;
25 correct?

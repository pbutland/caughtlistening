Proceedings
2091
1                 You can step down.
2                      (Witness is excused.)
3                 THE COURT:  Counsel, please approach.
4                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
5                 record.)
6                 THE COURT:  I just want to address something you
7       raised earlier.
8                 Do we need to resolve those now, before the next
9       witness?
10                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.  I haven't talked to my
11       co-counsel, or these guys, about what a stipulation would
12       look like, potentially, with the business records
13       objection.
14                 Overall, it still exists.  We are still in the
15       fundamental issue.
16                 I believe that just the paralegal from the DA's
17       Office is going to try to admit tweets that have dates and
18       other information on them.
19                 MS. MANGOLD:  We are not seeking to admit those
20       as business records.  There will be an adequate foundation
21       layed for those and that they are part of the --
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  Then the objection only remains for
23       the last one saying, you know, the tweet -- the Truth that
24       was sent in August that says, if you come after me, I am
25       coming after you, that objection.

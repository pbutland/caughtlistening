1 Q. You mentioned a minute ago that shortly after you
2 started working at The Trump Organization, you began to work for
3 Mr. Trump's campaign for President; is that right?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. Can you say a little bit more about how that came
6 about?
7 A. Yes.
8 So, Mr. Trump, one day he said, "We're going to Iowa,"
9 and I don't really know why, but after that first trip to Iowa,
10 you know, obviously, it was clear he was exploring a potential
11 political run.
12 And we started to travel regularly over the next couple
13 of weeks and months to New Hampshire, South Carolina and
14 Washington. He would give speeches, meet with voters, attend
15 different panels and submit discussions, media interviews, et
16 cetera.
17 He eventually made the decision to formalize that, with
18 an Exploratory Committee at first, and then announced he was
19 going to run for President in June.
20 Q. Is that June of 2015?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Do you remember when that initial Iowa trip was?
23 A. Sometime in January of 2015.
24 Q. Did there come a time that you were offered an official
25 role in the campaign?

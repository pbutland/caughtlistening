1       A    Okay.
2                 (Pause.)
3       A    So after we had taken an image, right, these are
4   snapshots that we take of the device after we do the
5   extraction.
6       We then load it into the same software, and we use the
7   software to take screen shots.
8       Q    And so, these, on Defense G17, are images of the face
9   of the phone in different states at the time you got it on or
10   around January 23rd; is that your understanding?
11       A    That would be correct, yes.
12       Q    And so, you testified yesterday that you found a Signal
13   app on this phone; right?
14       A    There was.
15       Q    And you said that the Signal app allows users to
16   conduct encrypted communication; correct?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And to send something encrypted is communications which
19   allows users to send communications to explode or self-delete?
20       A    On some of them you can do that, yes.
21       Q    It's a user option; correct?
22       A    It is.
23       Q    And when that happens, when Signal is set up in that
24   fashion, it is -- it becomes -- and the messages are deleted by
25   the app, it is very difficult for a forensic technician like

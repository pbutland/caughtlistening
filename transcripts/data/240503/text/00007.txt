1       but what the Court has already done, and what the Court
2       should do, in light of the Weinstein decision, is be very
3       careful about the letting in this kind of evidence.
4                THE COURT:  When you say "the Weinstein decision,"
5       are you referring to the Court of Appeals reversal?
6                MR. BLANCHE:  That just came down, your Honor.
7                THE COURT:  That's a decision that deals with
8       Sandoval and Molineux.
9                I don't see it having any impact on my ruling.
10                MR. BLANCHE:  Well, your Honor is letting this in
11       on, at least in part, on a Molineux.
12                THE COURT:  The Court of Appeals didn't lay out any
13       new law, they simply ruled on the facts of that case.
14                But the Molineux ruling, the law that applies to
15       Molineux, the law that applies to Sandoval, it remains the
16       same.
17                And that's the same standard that I applied when I
18       made my decisions.
19                MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, agreed.  Even under that
20       application that you applied, it would be extremely unfair
21       and extremely prejudicial, given the Court's ruling already,
22       to now extend it more to say that there is only going to
23       be testimony -- there is only going to be multiple
24       witnesses.
25                THE COURT:  I don't necessarily disagree with you,

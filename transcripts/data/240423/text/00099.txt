1        defendant's behest, who are working with the witness to
2        either pump up the positive stories about Mr. Trump or
3        pump negative stories about the opponents.
4                 That is part of the whole scheme here.  These are
5        almost like verbal acts.  It's not for the truth of the
6        matter being asserted if the witness is asked if Stephen
7        Bannon asked the witness to run a particular story.
8                 THE COURT:  So you are not offering the statement
9        for its truth?
10                 I need to give the jury an instruction.
11                 MS. NECHELES:  These stories, he is not offering
12        these stories, but the fact that Stephen Bannon asked this
13        of the witness for the truth.
14                 He wants to put in evidence that Stephen Bannon
15        asked this to show that Stephen Bannon did, in fact, ask
16        it, that's the definition of "for the truth."
17                 That is pure hearsay, the stories.  He is not
18        putting the stories in, he is putting testimony about what
19        Stephen Bannon did.
20                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think there are several answers
21        to that, but at least one of them is, if there are
22        multiple co-conspirators -- this is going to come up soon
23        anyway -- if there are multiple co-conspirators who are
24        conspiring to influence the election under the Election
25        Law, that is part of the secondary crime, which we have to

1   this over a landline. He said we should use Signal.
2       I didn't really know what Signal was. I never heard of it
3   before.
4       And he said it was an app. He explained to me that it was
5   an encrypted app where nobody could trace it, and that there's
6   no paper trail, and there's nobody that can listen in to the
7   conversations. And then the conversation, apparently, is
8   destroyed after you have the call.
9       I still to this day don't know if that's true or not.
10       Q    Did you agree to use the Signal app to communicate
11   with Michael Cohen from time to time?
12       A    I did.
13       And every time I used it, it dropped off after like
14   30 seconds. But I would call back.
15       Q    Did there come a time -- did you ever come to
16   believe that Michael Cohen had spoken with Mr. Trump about
17   Ms. McDougal's claims?
18       A    Yes, I did.
19       Q    Can you explain to the jury how you became to believe
20   that?
21       A    I was at my -- I was in New Jersey at my largest -- at
22   my largest investigator in American Media, making a business
23   presentation. And their assistant for their office came in and
24   said, "Donald Trump is on the phone for you."
25       So, I left to pick up the phone to speak to Mr. Trump.

1       Q    Okay.  And were there instances where Mr. Schiller
2   would pass messages on to you from Mr. Trump?
3       A    Yes, but also infrequently.
4       Q    Okay.  Did you have occasion over the years to observe
5   Mr. Trump's business practices?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    In what context?
8       A    I was -- I had a meeting with Mr. Trump in his office,
9   and when I was there his assistant Rhona brought in a batch of
10   invoices and checks to sign.
11       And I observed Mr. Trump, he asked me, while he was
12   reviewing the accounts payable packages, he -- we were talking
13   at the same time, and I noticed that he reviewed the invoice and
14   looked at the check and then he would -- he was signing them.
15       Q    So on the occasion that you or the occasions that you
16   noticed that, did you, could you tell whether the check was
17   stapled to the invoice or just somehow attached to it?
18       A    I, as I recollect, the entire package was stapled
19   together.
20       Q    And so you observed him reviewing what looked like an
21   invoice and signing what looked like a check?
22       A    That is correct.
23       Q    How would you describe -- withdrawn.
24       Did you visit Mr. Trump at Trump Tower on multiple
25   occasions?

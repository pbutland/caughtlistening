Hearing — Mr. Blanche
Page 976
1 Judge, this goes directly to the willfulness that
2 your Honor has to find beyond a reasonable doubt for
3 President Trump.
4 There have been multiple reposts since your Honor
5 has imposed the Gag Order, and then the second Gag Order
6 that the People have not complained about.
7 And we mentioned a few in our papers involving the
8 recusal motion and things that if, if the People really ——
9 if the People felt or the Court felt that a repost was a
10 violation, it's not a statement by President Trump.
11 And so, Judge, it's that ——
12 THE COURT: No, I read that in your papers and I
13 actually want to respond to that.
14 MR. BLANCHE: Please.
15 THE COURT: That suggests that somehow because the
16 People or the Court do not take action for every single
17 violation that the Gag Order is waived; that's just silly.
18 MR. BLANCHE: That's absolutely not what we're
19 saying.
20 THE COURT: No, it is what you're saying.
21 No, first of all, you suggested that the Court
22 should do something.
23 I think you understand the difference between what
24 is a summary criminal contempt and what is not a summary
25 criminal contempt.

l was, I submit, is very normal standard campaign work.
2 And I agree with Mr. Steinglass, that is the type
3 of thing that will come up throughout the trial. That
4 predicate should not be used as an excuse to shovel in
5 hearsay from witnesses who will testify at the trial.
6 THE COURT: Let me hear from Mr. Steinglass.
7 MR. STEINGLASS: I think we disagree with that
8 characterization. To the extent that Mr. Bannon could be
9 seen as a person who is contributing to the endeavor to
10 publish negative stories about Mr. Trump's political
11 opponents, that is very much a part of the conspiracy.
12 True, that in and of itself might not be criminal,
13 we can have much debate back and forth on this.
14 In connection with all of the other evidence in
15 the case and the robust components of the agreement that
16 was forged at Trump Tower to influence the election, that
17 was a piece of it.
18 The evidence doesn't have to be conclusive to be
19 admissible. It has to be relevant, and it's relevant to
20 this idea of the conspiracy, whether Mr. Bove has a
21 proved innocent explanation for it or not.
22 THE COURT: All right.
23 With regard to Mr. Bannon, at this point it
24 appears to be a moot point because you are going to move
25 on, right?

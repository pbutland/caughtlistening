Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 953
1 deliberation and willfulness in making the post.
2 All of the posts here are made concerning this
3 criminal proceeding. We know that from the proximity. We
4 know that from the words. We know that because they are
5 consistent with the defense in this case as outlined in
6 counsel's opening yesterday. It's very clear that they
7 relate to this case.
8 I am not sure how there could be a straight—faced
9 argument that these posts, all within the last 12 days or
10 so, some of them echoed in counsel's opening yesterday,
11 relate to anything other than this criminal proceeding.
12 Throwing MAGA into a post doesn't make it political. It
13 may make it more ominous.
14 Defendant's 10 posts at issue today are willful
15 violations of the Court's order on April lst. The
16 defendant knows the terms of the April lst order.
17 He has repeatedly complained about the order on
18 his social media account, including, among others, and I
19 handed the posts up in the packet that I handed up of the
20 10 violations, there is a post from April 2nd, from April
21 6th and from April 10th and 11th.
22 THE COURT: Is that Exhibits 12, 13 and 14?
23 MR. CONROY: Yes. Exhibit 12, is April 2nd.
24 Exhibit 13 is April 6th. Exhibit 14 is April 10th. And
25 Exhibit 15 is actually a screenshot that would appear on

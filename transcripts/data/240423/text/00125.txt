1       A    I asked Dylan to verify if the story was true or not.
2       Q    Okay.
3       Thank you.
4       You mentioned a Source document; yes?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    What is a Source document?
7       A    A Source document is an agreement with a potential
8   source or tipster that they have a story. And the agreement is
9   between the magazine and the tipster or the source that says
10   for a period of time, 90 days, 120 days, we have exclusive
11   rights, the magazine has exclusive rights to the story. And
12   then there's a compensation in the agreement based on if the
13   story is published or not.
14       Q    Did you enter into such an agreement with Mr. Sajudin?
15       A    Yes, we did.
16       Q    How did that come about?
17       A    I asked Dylan to negotiate a price -- to negotiate a
18   number, a price to buy the story and take it off the market.
19   And Dylan went ahead.
20       And there was two parts to this. The first part is, our
21   normal procedures is we have the source or the tipster take a
22   polygraph test, and we normally pay $500 for a polygraph test.
23       So, we took the polygraph --
24       Q    Please don't tell us any polygraph results. Just keep
25   that.

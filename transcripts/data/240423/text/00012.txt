Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 949
1 p.m., the defendant published a post on his Truth Social
2 account that stated, they are catching undercover liberal
3 activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump
4 jury.
5 I want to give the court a little bit of context
6 for that Truth.
7 And that is a quote. That whole thing is in
8 quotation marks. It's attributed to somebody named Jesse
9 Watters. On that day, last Wednesday, there was a segment
10 on a Fox News show called, At Five, that airs at 5:00 in
11 the afternoon.
12 On that show Jesse Watters, who is one of the
13 commentators, spoke about the jurors who had been seated or
14 were being interviewed in this case in a derogatory way.
15 Mr. Watters said the first part of what Mr. Trump posted.
16 He said the first part, in order to get on the Trump jury.
17 Now, Mr. Watters may have said things like, in
18 order to get on the Trump jury, later in that episode or
19 later that night when he has another show at 8:00, but he
20 didn't say it at 5:08 on his show, and this post came at
21 5:46, about 30 minutes later, give or take.
22 THE COURT: What exactly did he say?
23 MR. CONROY: So he said —— what Mr. Watters said
24 was, they are catching undercover liberal activists lying
25 to the Judge, period.

1       involving the Avenatti comment and the comment regarding
2       Mr. Cohen not being convicted of perjury and the comments
3       about Ms. Clifford and Mr. Cohen.  Okay.
4                 Those comments, those three posts, were in direct
5       response to comments made by these witnesses, not about
6       these criminal proceedings, your Honor, not about their
7       testimony at the witness stand and President Trump's
8       comments back to them was not about their testimony from
9       the witness stand.
10                 THE COURT:  When you say, these three posts, just
11       so I can follow them, can we adopt the number used by the
12       prosecution?
13                 If you can refer me to this, what you are talking
14       about.
15                 MR. BLANCHE:  The first was a repost from
16       President Trump's Truth Social regarding Mr. Avenatti.
17       Commenting about the hypocrisy of the Gag Order and making
18       the point that, which is true, that the witnesses
19       themselves can constantly comment about whatever they want.
20       They are not gagged.  And President Trump, in theory,
21       cannot respond.
22                 Now, as we put in our papers, and the People
23       don't contest except to say there is no evidence from the
24       Truths that President Trump knew about these, Michael Cohen
25       directly responded to this comment by Avenatti,

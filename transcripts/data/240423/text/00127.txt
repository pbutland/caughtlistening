1 He said that the —— Mr. Trump would take a DNA test, that he is
2 German—Irish, and this woman is Hispanic, and it's absolutely
3 impossible.
4 And I told Michael Cohen that that won't be necessary;
5 we'll vet the story.
6 Q So, let me be clear about something. Prior to this
7 arrangement to purchase this story from Dino Sajudin, had you
8 ever paid a source to kill a story about Donald Trump?
9 A No, I did not.
10 Q Now, what was the reason that you were willing to pay
11 for this story at this point?
12 A I had a number of reasons.
13 One, I thought it was very important that Dino wouldn't be
14 shopping the story to other media outlets, and it would get in
15 the marketplace very quickly. That was part one.
16 Part two, I bought the story, if the story was true and I
17 published it, it would be probably the biggest sale of the
18 National Enquirer since the death of Elvis Presley.
19 Q Did you have any intention of publishing it at the
20 time you negotiated this deal?
21 A At that time, no.
22 Q What was your intention in terms of publishing it,
23 depending on how your vetting went?
24 A If the story came back true, I would have published
25 the story shortly after it was verified.

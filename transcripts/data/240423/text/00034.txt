1 contempt or not. So please don't turn it around.
2 What I do see is I keep asking you over and over
3 again for a specific example, and I am not getting an
4 answer. And it's now almost 10:30.
5 The jurors are going to be here at 11:00. I
6 don't want to keep them waiting. So we are only up to
7 Exhibit Number 2.
8 MR. BLANCHE: The People got to speak as long as
9 they wanted to.
10 THE COURT: The People were answering my
11 questions. It's almost 10:30. We are only up to Exhibit
12 Number 2.
13 Let's go to Exhibit Number 3 and tell me what he
14 was responding to in Exhibit Number 3.
15 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, Exhibit 3 has nothing
16 to do with this investigation. It's a complaint about the
17 system, which President Trump is completely entitled to
18 complain about. And the fact that there is a key witness
19 in this case who is in prison right now for lying at a
20 proceeding that Mr. Cohen also lied at.
21 And, again, it has nothing to do with his
22 testimony here.
23 THE COURT: He or his comrades? Make the
24 connection to what he is responding to in Exhibit Number 3
25 when he is referring to Mark Pomerantz.

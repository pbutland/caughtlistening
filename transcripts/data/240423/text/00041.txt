1                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, the Gag Order prevents

3                Reposting an article from a news site or from a
4       news program or, you know, a New York Post article or the
5       articles that are in Exhibits 3 through 10, we don't believe
6       are a violation of the Gag Order.

20                THE COURT:  All right.  Where does it say that,
21       give me the case law?
22                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, there is none.  I don't
23       believe --

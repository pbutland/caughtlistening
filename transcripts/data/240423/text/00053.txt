Hearing - Mr. Blanche
Page 990
1       is just that it illustrates what the defendant thinks about
2       what happens when he posts something on Truth.
3                It's a 2-page post.
4                I'm just going to read it.  It's from April 4th,
5       2024.
6                One page -- it appears one page of the post is
7       about an hour earlier than the other on that day.
8                But he's talking about his company Truth Social
9       and he says:  "But when I put out a statement or message" --
10       and I'm not sure what the distinction is in his mind -- "it
11       is spread all over the place, fast and furious.  Everybody
12       seems to get whatever I have to say and quickly."
13                So that's what we know about what the defendant
14       thinks of his use of Truth Social.
15                Judge, there is a lawful order here.  It's very
16       clear.
17                The defendant has violated it willfully and
18       knowingly by posting these posts.  And we are asking the
19       Court to hold him in contempt.
20                MR. BLANCHE:  Quick scheduling question, Judge.
21                THE COURT:  Yes.
22                MR. BLANCHE:  We are going to take a break until
23       11.
24                Is it the Court's intention to go from 11 to 2
25       straight?

Hearing - Mr. Blanche
Page 982
1       of a criminal trial and you are asking whether I should put
2       President Trump on the stand; is that the question?
3                THE COURT:  Well, I'm just telling you that you
4       have presented nothing.
5                I have asked you 8 or 9 times, show me the exact
6       posts that he was responding to, and you have been unable to
7       do that even once.
8                Let me ask you about Exhibit 10.
9                (Pause.)
10                *******
11                THE COURT:  So this is Exhibit 10.

13                And it says, in quotes, "They are catching
14       undercover liberal activists lying to the Judge in order to

16                And then it's attributed to Jesse Waters.
17                Is that, in fact, what Mr. Waters said?
18                MR. BLANCHE:  He said, "They are catching
19       undercover liberal activists lying to the Judge."
20                And then not -- at the time, I don't believe he
21       said "in order to get on the Trump jury."
22                THE COURT:  Well, at the time that he reposted
23       this, he had not said that?
24                MR. BLANCHE:  Correct.
25                THE COURT:  So your client manipulated what was

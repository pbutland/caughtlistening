1       defendant that this conduct will not be tolerated and
2       remind him that incarceration is an option should it be
3       necessary.
4                 The defendant is having his day in court.
5       Unfortunately, he is still doing everything he can to
6       undermine this process.  It has to stop.
7                 A finding of criminal contempt, imposition of
8       sanctions and stark warnings from this Court are the
9       minimum remedies necessary to try to stop the defendant
10       from engaging in this behavior.
11                 Thank you.
12                 THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Conroy.

22       facing a barrage of political attacks from all sides,
23       including from the two witnesses who are referenced in the
24       early posts.  And I am going to separate, your Honor, if I
25       can, the reposts from the first round of alleged violations

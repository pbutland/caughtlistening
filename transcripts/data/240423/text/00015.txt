Hearing - Mr. Conroy

1       argue that this provision is ambiguous.
2                 The order is clear, notwithstanding the
3       defendant's willingness to make arguments that conflict
4       with the facts and at times with each other.  And the
5       clarity is stark with respect to this provision related to
6       jurors, particularly when contrasted to the more specific
7       language that modifies witnesses, the Court and DANY
8       personnel.
9                 Judge, I would just refer to some of the
10       language.
11                 And I won't read it, some of the language in the
12       Court's April 1st order, talking about why it is so
13       important to issue that order now based on the defendant's
14       history, based on this proceeding, and based on what was
15       going on.
16                 There is no doubt that this defendant made these
17       statements.  And I just want to talk a little bit more
18       about the back and forth on that last post, the 10th post
19       with Jesse Watters because I think those two -- the
20       defendant's willfulness in these posts, defendant took
21       something that Jesse Watters said, added to it and posted
22       it.  And it came from a segment specifically discussing
23       juror profiles in this case.
24                 He did it about 40 minutes after Jesse Watters
25       said part of the statement.  To me, that shows very clear

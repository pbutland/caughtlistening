2                 MR. BLANCHE:  Of course.  Yes, your Honor.
3                 Your Honor, says you don't want to interpret or
4       read into it, but we have to be able to have some inference
5       for what Mr. Avenatti means when he is saying that.
6                 THE COURT:  Have you spoken with Mr. Avenatti
7       about what he means?
8                 MR. BLANCHE:  No.  Of course, no.

15       the social media posts and on documentaries.

17       understand.

19       said does not relate to the trial, but that the use of the
20       word, pardon, by Mr. Cohen does make it political and, in a
21       sense, authorize your client to respond?
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  Not just the word, pardon, but yes,
23       the word pardon too.
24                 But, Judge, it just -- it's everything.  It just

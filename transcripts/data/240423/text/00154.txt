3                 THE COURT:  Mr. Bove, your objection is noted.
4                 I'm certainly going to use today and tomorrow to
5        conduct further research into it.
6                 I would ask you, as well, if you could forward
7        anything to me to help guide the Court.
8                 And I would ask the People, as well, if you could
9        forward any authority to the Court that would help me.
10                 MR. BOVE:  Could we have the Court's permission
11        to put in a letter not to exceed two pages on this issue?
12                 THE COURT:  Sure. That's fine.
13                 Can you get it in by the end of the night?
14                 MR. BOVE:  Yes, sir.
15                 THE COURT:  Have a good night, everyone.
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.

5       Q    How about just Trish?
6       A    Trish, yes.  Trish was my assistant.
7       Q    You don't remember your assistant's last name,
8   Mr. Pecker?  That's not going to go over very well.
9       A    Well, I always called her Trish for a number of years,
10   very rarely saw her last name.

12   your assistant?
13       A    Yes.

18       A    Since the late 80s.
19       Q    Do you see him today in the courtroom?

21       Q    Would you please point him out and would you please
22   tell us something that he's wearing?

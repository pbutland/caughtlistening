Hearing - Mr. Blanche
Page 977
1                Unless that occurs in my presence before me, the
2       Court is not going to bring an action, okay.
3                As far as why the People chose to implore some and
4       not others, that's their business, but that doesn't negate
5       the validity of the Gag Order.
6                MR. BLANCHE:  And, your Honor, if that came out in
7       our papers, that is absolutely not our position.
8                Our position is that your Honor has to find a
9       willful violation beyond a reasonable doubt.
10                And it is certainly appropriate for the Court to
11       take into consideration whether President Trump's conduct
12       was willful beyond a reasonable doubt.
13                The fact that, you know, when he reposted the ones,
14       Exhibits 3 through 10, the fact that he had reposted many
15       others, and the People had not brought an Order to Show
16       Cause, it's not making a mockery of the Gag Order, your
17       Honor.  It's a close call.
18                THE COURT:  Well, what is it if your argument is
19       not that somehow the validity of the Gag Order is waived,
20       then what is your argument because that's what it sounds
21       like to me.
22                MR. BLANCHE:  No, because the posts --
23                THE COURT:  No, the People did not bring an Order
24       to Show Cause for certain alleged violations, therefore,
25       he's allowed to violate whenever he wants?

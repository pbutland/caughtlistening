3                THE COURT:  Two systems of justice in this
4       courtroom; is that what you're saying?
5                MR. BLANCHE:  That's what his message is, your
6       Honor, that Mr. Weisselberg is in prison and Mr. Cohen is
7       not.
8                That's not the first time that this has been said.
9                THE COURT:  It's not.
10                MR. BLANCHE:  No, it's not.
11                And, Judge, as your Honor has made plain, that's
12       fair game.
13                And as the law may explain and the constitution may
14       explain, that's fair game for President Trump to complain
15       about.
16                And to focus on the reposts now, if your Honor
17       wants to move to the reposts?
18                THE COURT:  We can.
19                MR. BLANCHE:  Okay.
20                THE COURT:  Just before we get to the reposts, when
21       we get to each specific repost, just tell me what number you
22       are referring to.
23                MR. BLANCHE:  I'm referring to the remainder, many
24       of them -- just two, the same posts just kind of reworked on
25       a different, either on Truth or through the campaign.

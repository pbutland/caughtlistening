D. Pecker - Direct/Steinglass

1                 Everything in a business record is, arguably, an
2        out-of-court statement being offered for the truth.
3                 So, I do think that, for example, if a person who
4        was a party to a conversation was not under a business
5        duty to do so accurately, that would be embedded hearsay,
6        and that would need to find another exception to the
7        hearsay rule.
8                 I believe the primary exception to the hearsay
9        rule on which we would rely is co-conspirator hearsay.
10                 And I believe the testimony of Mr. Pecker has
11        already established a prima facie case of conspiracy, so
12        that statements made in the business records that are in
13        furtherance of that conspiracy would be admissible, in
14        addition, on those grounds.
15                 But, I think -- I -- I am suggesting, gently,
16        that it would be an uncharitable view of the business
17        records exception to suggest that every statement
18        contained in a business record has to be independently
19        admissible under some objection other than business
20        records.
21                 THE COURT:  I agree. I agree.
22                 MR. BOVE:  Judge -- Judge, that's the law, that
23        when there's embedded hearsay, hearsay within hearsay,
24        that there has to be another basis for the statements to
25        be admissible. That's in the New York Rules of Evidence.

1   process it through the AMI system, you need an invoice. So, the
2   Source Agreement supports the invoice, what the amount is going
3   to be and who was being paid for.
4       And then we have the W9 prepared, so the Source will sign
5   it, so we withhold the taxes.
6                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
7                 Move to strike.
8                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
9       Q    Can you read the body of the email or, I guess, the
10   invoice attachment?
11       A    "This serves as an invoice for an immediate $30,000
12   bank transfer payment from AMI to Source Dino Sajudin regarding
13   Trump non-published story."
14       Q    Before you move on, what did you understand "Trump
15   non-published story" to be a reference to?
16       A    Well, Barry Levine --
17                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
18                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
19                 You can answer.
20       A    Barry Levine would know -- knows because he was told
21   that we're not gonna publish any negative stories on Donald
22   Trump. So, he correctly wrote the invoice -- excuse me -- the
23   email to state here that it wasn't going to be published.
24       Q    Okay.
25       And you can keep going. Read the next one.

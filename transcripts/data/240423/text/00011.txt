1       to the serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor
2       against Trump in an embarrassment to the New York Legal
3       System.
4                 Again, those are so clearly related to a
5       reasonably foreseeable witness in this proceeding.
6                 On April 16, 7:09 p.m. -- the other thing to keep
7       in mind, and I know your Honor knows this, I am just going
8       to say it for the record, this is while we are on trial.
9       The trial has now begun.
10                 On April 16th, at 7:09 p.m., the defendant
11       published a post on his Truth Social account that contained
12       an article attacking the testimony of Michael Cohen.  The
13       article had a picture of Michael Cohen with the headline,
14       no, Cohen's guilty pleas does not prove Trump committed
15       campaign finance crimes.  The entire article was embedded
16       in the post.
17                 And, again, that's what I handed up as 9A.  If
18       you clicked on various parts of the article, the particular
19       page of the article would come up in a more readable form.
20       The whole thing was visible when you clicked into Truth.
21                 And, again, reasonably foreseeable witness,
22       direct reference to this proceeding, very clear link to the
23       order that this Court issued on April 1st.
24                 The next day, and this was last Wednesday, April
25       17th, and, again, this is a very troubling post at 5:46

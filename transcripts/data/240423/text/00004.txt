Hearing - Mr. Conroy

1       intimidating both defendant's direct targets, as well as
2       others who may be called upon to participate in these
3       proceedings and who, rightly, fear being subject for
4       vitriol and sort of the undertow affect that we worry
5       about.
6                 Here, the defendant sought an emergency stay in
7       the First Department, and I will talk a little bit more
8       about that in a few minutes.  That application was denied
9       on April 9th, the application for the stay and the next day
10       the post at issue here started.
11                 Defendant has violated this order repeatedly and
12       he hasn't stopped.
13                 I just want to note for the record that
14       yesterday, here in this building, right outside those
15       doors, in a pen setup from which he has daily conducted
16       press conferences on his way into and out of the courtroom,
17       the defendant violated the order again on camera.  He did
18       it right here in the hallway outside.
19                 He said, among other things, they didn't say you
20       building a building, and this is a transcript, they didn't
21       say you building a building and called a payment to a
22       lawyer because as you know Cohen is a lawyer.  He
23       represented a lot of people over the years.  I am not the
24       only one and he wasn't very good in a lot of ways in terms
25       of misrepresentation.  But he represented a lot of people.

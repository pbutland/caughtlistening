1        prove, that there is a conspiracy to influence the
2        election.
3                 So this seems to me to be the heart of the
4        admissible evidence in this case.
5                 So I think it's res gestae of that conspiracy.
6        It's res gestae and co-conspirator statements.
7                 MR. BOVE:  Res gestae doesn't overcome the hearsay
8        exception.
9                 This is the first we're hearing from the
10        Government about Stephen Bannon being an alleged
11        co-conspirator in connection with the so-called conspiracy
12        to influence the election.
13                 The Government just elicited testimony that he is
14        a member of the campaign working to do, at best, based on
15        the hearsay that's been elicited so far, normal traditional
16        campaign work that everybody does.  This should not come in
17        as a co-conspirator statement.
18                 THE COURT:  I will excuse the jury.
19                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in
20        open court:)
21                 THE COURT:  We're going to go ahead and take a
22        short break at this time.
23                 You can step out.
24                 (Jury leaving courtroom.)
25                 THE COURT:  Mr. Pecker, you can step out.

1       A    I'm sorry.
2       "Attached is the paperwork, including the execution of the
3   contract Amendment signed by Mr. Sajudin, as prepared yesterday
4   by Cameron Stracher for this sole purpose of payment."
5       Q    Who is Cameron Stracher?
6       A    He's the -- he was the General Counsel in American
7   Media.
8       Q    Thank you.
9       So, you told us a minute ago that after you investigated
10   the story, you determined that it was not true.
11       A    That's correct.
12       Q    And did you communicate that to Michael Cohen?
13       A    Yes, I did.
14       Q    And can you describe that?
15       A    I told Michael Cohen the story was not true. I told
16   him that the doorman is very difficult to deal with. I
17   mentioned to him that he's probably going to try to shop the
18   story to someone else, and that we don't really share any
19   concerns here since the story is not true anyhow, so I would
20   suggest that we release him.
21       Q    And how did Michael Cohen react to that?
22       A    Michael Cohen said -- first, he didn't understand why
23   I would ever release him.
24       And then I said that -- to have him lock -- to have him
25   in -- to have him locked in to us, it's only gonna cause more

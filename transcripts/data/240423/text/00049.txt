4                If anything, the reposts and whether something can
5       be reposted, an article written by a reporter can be
6       reposted, and that is a violation of the Gag Order, that's
7       ambiguous and that's something that we certainly were not
8       aware of.
9                We don't read the Gag Order that way, and if that's
10       the way that it's going to be enforced, we will take down

14                When you are thinking about criminal contempt and a

21       on, you know, for weeks, if that's a violation of the Gag
22       Order, we didn't read it that way.
23                And we will implement that and make sure that that
24       doesn't happen.
25                But certainly for all of the reasons that we've

1       related to this proceeding.
2                 THE COURT:  Thank you.
3                 I will be asking you the same question for each
4       of the 10.
5                 MR. CONROY:  Thank you.
6                 April 10, 2024 at 10:48 a.m., the defendant
7       published a post on his Truth Social account that contained
8       a picture of a document and that document, by the way, will
9       be at issue in this case.
10                 The document was entitled, Official Statement of
11       Stormy Daniels, dated January 30,2018, which refers to
12       facts that are directly at issue here.  The defendant
13       accompanied the picture with his own statement, look what
14       was just found from a fake news reporter.
15                 Again, Judge, that is a document with respect to
16       the first subsection in the order.  It is a document that
17       relates to a reasonably foreseeable witness in this
18       proceeding.  It is a document that relates, specifically,
19       to things that she'll testify about in this proceeding.
20                 And so, I don't think there is any other
21       interpretation of that post, again, posted five days before
22       jury selection, than that it relates to this proceeding.
23                 On April 13, 2024, at 12:56 p.m., the defendant
24       posted a post on his Truth Social account and stated, has
25       Mark Pomerantz been prosecuted for his terrible acts in and

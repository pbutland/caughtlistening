1   Bill Clinton's womanizing was the biggest, one of the biggest
2   sales I had for the National Enquirer and the other tabloids,
3   that's the other things that the readers wanted to read about
4   and that's what I would sell weekly.
5       So I was running the Hillary Clinton stories.
6       I was running Hillary as an enabler for Bill Clinton, with
7   respect to all of the womanizing.
8       And I was -- it was easy for me to say that I'm going to
9   continue running those type of stories for the National
10   Enquirer.
11       Q    And did you believe that that would help Mr. Trump's
12   campaign?
13       A    I think it was a mutual benefit.  It would help his
14   campaign; it would also help me.
15       Q    Okay.  I'm going to come back to that and ask you to
16   elaborate a little bit more?
17       A    Okay.
18       Q    But specifically for the coverage of Hillary Clinton as
19   an enabler of Bill Clinton's womanizing, that was your focus?
20       A    Yes, that's what I said.
21       Q    How, if at all, did Mr. Trump react to your suggestion
22   that you would continue to do that?
23       A    He was pleased.
24       Q    Did you discuss it at any greater length?
25       A    As I recollect, he was pleased.

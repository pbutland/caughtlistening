Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 950
1 What was in the quotation on the defendant's
2 Truth was, they are catching undercover liberal activists
3 lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump jury.
4 So it is a hybrid of something somebody else said
5 together with something the defendant, apparently, added on
6 his own.
7 I think the link to the jurors in this case, to
8 this proceeding, I think it's very clearly a violation of
9 your order on April 1st and so, that deals with that.
10 The other piece I want to add to that is if you,
11 I am sure, again, I am sure you remember, but for the
12 record, this was last Wednesday evening, that this was
13 going on and Mr. Watters in his segment was giving lots of
14 details about the various jurors.
15 The next day was the day juror two came in and
16 said, I don't think I can be on this anymore because of
17 publicity and things she was hearing from friends and
18 acquaintances and everything else, so we ended up losing a
19 juror.
20 What happened here is precisely what this order
21 was designed to prevent, and this defendant doesn't care.
22 The burden here, Judge, is on us. And, Judge,
23 that's the 10 posts. I don't know if you have any
24 questions specifically about those or I was going to move
25 on.

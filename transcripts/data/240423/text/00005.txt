1       But he puts in an invoice or whatever, a bill, and calls it
2       a legal expense, and I got indicted for that.
3                 He later went on and said, and what are they
4       going to look at?  All the lies that Cohen did in the last
5       trial?
6                 He got caught lying in the last trial.
7                 So he got caught lying, pure lying and what are
8       they going to look at?  That?
9                 We will be filing another Order to Show Cause for
10       this violation later today.
11                 The Court has warned the Defendant, his attacks
12       on witnesses clearly violate the order willfully and
13       flagrantly.  The Court should now hold him in contempt for
14       each of the 10 posts.
15                 The initial Decision and Order on March 26th,
16       restricting extrajudicial statements was issued after the
17       People demonstrated a long history of attacks on all the
18       participants in the judicial process here and in other
19       jurisdictions, witnesses, jurors, judges, lawyers, family
20       members.
21                 No one is off limits to the defendant and he can
22       attack and seek to intimidate anyone he wants to in service
23       to himself.
24                 On April 1st, the Court issued a second order
25       restricting the defendant's extrajudicial statements.  That

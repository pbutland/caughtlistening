2 Q. Now, I started to ask you before, did there come a time
3 when then candidate Trump introduced you to Stephen Bannon?
4 A. Yes, he did.
5 Q. Do you remember around when that was?
6 A. It was October of 2016.
7 Q. Who was Stephen Bannon at the time?
8 A. Stephen Bannon was a political consultant for Donald
9 Trump.
10 Q. And was he working on Donald Trump's campaign?
11 A. Yes, it was my understanding he was working on the
12 campaign.
13 Q. What, if anything, did Mr. Trump tell you about Stephen
14 Bannon?
15 A. He said to me that I believe that you and Stephen would
16 get along really well.
17 And Bannon, when I spoke to him, he said that he went
18 through some of these articles that you just displayed now, he
19 liked them very much. He had some other ideas and would I be
20 able to get him some issues, other issues of the National
21 Enquirer he could take a look at.
22 So in that meeting, I boxed up a bunch of issues of the
23 National Enquirer that had Hillary and stories along those
24 lines, and I remember sending it to his apartment. It was
25 someplace on the Upper West Side.

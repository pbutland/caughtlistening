Hearing - Mr. Conroy

1       claim that he is responding to attacks is anything more
2       than an after the facts justification for his contumacious
3       behavior.
4                 It is not clear at all that he was aware of the
5       posts he claims he was responding to at the time he made
6       the post that violates the Court's order.  Nothing on the
7       face of the post indicates that.  By his logic, if someone
8       covered by the order says something mean or not nice about
9       him, he can respond because the attack is political, I
10       suppose, because by talking about the defendant, the
11       speaker is a public figure or because the defendant is
12       running for office, again, it makes no sense.
13                 He says whatever he needs to say to get the
14       results that he wants.  It's tortured at best and would
15       eviscerate the clear language and meaning of this order if
16       the Court were to adopt that.
17                 The Court and the People have made clear that the
18       April 1st order leaves the defendant substantial room to
19       engage in speech about this criminal proceeding, including
20       criticisms of the Court and District Attorney.  The
21       defendant has shown his ability to understand the
22       significant leeway left to him by making multiple social
23       media posts and other public statements that criticize the
24       criminal trial without violating the April 1st order.
25                 By going beyond those criticism and launching

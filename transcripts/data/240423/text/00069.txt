1       A    I knew when Mr. Trump introduced Michael Cohen to me
2   that it was his personal lawyer.  That was the only title that I
3   knew.
4       Q    Okay.  So during the period from 2015 to 2017, I'm
5   obviously going to keep coming back to that period, was Michael
6   Cohen still in that role as a personal attorney to Mr. Trump?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    During that period, again, from 2015 to 2017, how
9   frequently would you meet with Michael Cohen?
10       A    I would speak to Michael Cohen probably if I had
11   something to call him about or I heard something, I had
12   something to discuss, probably maybe once a month, twice a
13   quarter.
14       And then if there was an issue or something that he wanted
15   to follow up on or I advised him of something and we were
16   working on it, I would speak to him more frequently.
17       Q    After, I think you mentioned earlier that at some point
18   in 20 -- we will come back to this later, that at some point in
19   2015 you told us that Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for
20   president?
21       A    That's correct.
22       Q    Did your -- did the frequency of contact that you had
23   with Michael Cohen increase, decrease or stay the same after
24   Mr. Trump announced his candidacy?
25       A    Increased.

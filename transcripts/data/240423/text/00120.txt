1                 It is not an exception to the hearsay rule that
2        the communicants are each employees at the company whose
3        -- the company whose business records are being offered.
4                 The fact that the employees are on those records
5        does not make them admissible.
6                 There's not been a foundation laid for a
7        suggestion, if I understood it correctly, that AMI --
8        every name of an employee is charged with a conspiracy, is
9        charged as a predicate.
10                 It is their burden to establish admissibility.
11                 THE COURT:  I'm accepting the records into
12        evidence as business records.
13                 If something comes up that you believe is hearsay
14        and is not admissible, you can make your objection.
15                 MR. BOVE:  Just, can I lay out numbers?
16                 THE COURT:  Yes.
17                 MR. BOVE:  173 and 174 are text messages between
18        Mr. Pecker and Dylan Howard. So, we are not objecting to
19        those coming in on this hearsay within hearsay argument on
20        the basis I described.
21                 Mr. Pecker, I understand, comes in.
22                 Mr. Howard's statements are inadmissible hearsay,
23        but they're admissible to provide contents to what
24        Mr. Pecker said.
25                 171-A, for example, is a series of messages

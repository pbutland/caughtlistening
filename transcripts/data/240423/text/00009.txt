Hearing - Mr. Conroy
Page 946
1       out of the DA's Office.  Has disgraced attorney and felon,
2       Michael Cohen, been prosecuted for lying.  Only Trump
3       people get prosecuted by this judge and these thugs.  A
4       dark day for our country.  MAGA 2024.
5                 Here again, Judge, Michael Cohen is a reasonably
6       foreseeable witness.  Throughout the pendency of this case
7       defendant and others have tried to make Mark Pomerantz
8       somehow an issue in this case.  This is, again, going after
9       Michael Cohen's credibility, which is a recurring theme in
10       these posts and, frankly, was a theme yesterday in the
11       opening statement for this case.
12                 And so, I think it's pretty clear now that we are
13       two days before jury selection and the defendant is again
14       going after Michael Cohen.
15                 On April 15, 2024 at 9:12 a.m., and this is while
16       the defendant was likely in the courthouse, the defendant
17       published a post on his Truth Social account that stated, a
18       serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor
19       against Trump in an embarrassment for the New York Legal
20       System.
21                 The post contained a link to an article in the
22       New York Post.  Clearly a reference to Michael Cohen.
23       Clearly a reference to this proceeding.
24                 And so, I think, again, that link to the order is
25       pretty clear with respect to this post.

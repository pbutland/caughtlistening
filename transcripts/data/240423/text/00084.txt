1 Q. Did you tell him why you asked him to keep this
2 arrangement secret?
3 A. Yes, I did.

6 campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as
7 possible.
8 Q. Because if it came out that you were helping the
9 campaign, it would kind of undermine the whole point?
10 MR. BOVE: Objection.
11 THE COURT: Sustained.
12 Q. So let me rephrase that.
13 Why was it important to you that the arrangement be
14 kept secret?
15 A. We have several hundred people that work within the
16 company, and being a tabloid company, the leaks are probably

18 organization, and I did not want anyone else to know about this
19 agreement I had and what I wanted to do, so that's why I wanted

22 pro—Trump articles in the National Enquirer?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. I am going to show you and only you —— well, the
25 attorneys, People's 152. Tell me when you see that pop up on

Hearing - Mr. Conroy

1       First Department they are saying he's forbidden.  He knows.
2       He is forbidden.  That's what the order says.
3                 And yet, they want to come now and claim and
4       muddy the waters and say, Judge, well, we can respond to
5       attacks.
6                 There is no provision in this order for

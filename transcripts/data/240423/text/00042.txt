Hearing - Mr. Blanche
Page 979
1       does it get onto your client's Truth Social account?
2                I post something and I post it on my account and
3       then it winds up on your client's account; how does it get
4       there?
5                MR. BLANCHE:  There is a group of folks that work
6       with President Trump that when they see articles that they
7       believe President Trump's audience should read they, you
8       know, there is a mechanism.
9                I'm not --
10                THE COURT:  What is the mechanism?
11                MR. BLANCHE:  So, I believe you click on it and you
12       do something to repost it on President Trump's feed.
13                THE COURT:  It requires some sort of action?
14                MR. BLANCHE:  Of course, yes, yes.
15                THE COURT:  It's not as if -- I'm looking for the
16       decision that I read yesterday -- it's not passive.
17                There is case law that talks about the difference
18       between passive conduct and what we're describing.
19                Passive conduct would be if someone makes a post
20       and it somehow winds up in your client's account without him
21       or anybody else doing anything.
22                MR. BLANCHE:  That's not our position.
23                THE COURT:  No, it's not your position, which means
24       that someone had to do something.
25                MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.

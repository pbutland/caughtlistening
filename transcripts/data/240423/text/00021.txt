Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 958
1 THE COURT: Sure.
2 MR. CONROY: Here we are dealing with a court
3 order that specifically prohibits certain types of
4 extrajudicial statements and that clearly includes posts on
5 defendant's Truth Social account and on his campaign
6 website whether he is the original author or posting the
7 words of another. And as the Court noted the other day,
8 the law is clear that a party may not challenge a Court's
9 order by violating it.
10 Your Honor, the Judiciary Law authorizes the
11 Court to impose a fine not exceeding a thousand dollar or
12 to sentence the contemnor to no more than 30 days jail or
13 both in the discretion of the Court. That is in Judiciary
14 Law 751, and that's for each finding of contempt.
15 We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty.
16 The defendant seems to be angling for that.
17 For today, for these 10 violations of this
18 Court's April 1st Order, we are asking the Court to impose
19 the maximum number, $1,000 fine for each of the 10
20 violations.
21 We are also asking the Court to order the
22 Defendant to remove all 10 offending posts, eight from his
23 Truth Social account, and two from his campaign website, to
24 take those down.
25 Finally, for the Court to again warn the

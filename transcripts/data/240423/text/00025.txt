2                 Can you confirm what time Mr. Cohen's post was?
3                 MR. BLANCHE:  I don't have that in front of me.
4                 THE COURT:  It's just been handed to me.
5                 So, Mr. Cohen's post, I believe was at 9:21.  So,
6       that would precede Mr. Avenatti's post.
7                 MR. BLANCHE:  Well, your Honor, to be clear,
8       Mr. Avenatti had been saying things like this publicly.
9       There have been news articles about it that he had been
10       saying it.  So he has been -- he has somebody on the
11       outside, a Federal person, that is pushing articles, and to
12       be -- and, your Honor, there is no dispute that Mr. Cohen
13       has repeatedly talked about the fact that, again, not for
14       having to do with his testimony about how President Trump
15       acted with respect to pardons while in office --
16                 THE COURT:  I want to take one at a time,
17       otherwise, it's going to get really confusing.
18                 Let's take number one, what I see is Mr. Cohen's
19       post at 9:21.  Mr. Avenatti's response appears to be at
20       10:07 or is that when it was reposted by Mr. Trump?
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, correct.
22                 THE COURT:  It was reposted by Mr. Trump?
23                 MR. CONROY:  I believe that's correct.
24                 THE COURT:  And it's your position that what
25       makes this political is the reference of being pardoned.

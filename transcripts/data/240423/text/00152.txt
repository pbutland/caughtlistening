1       Q    Did you understand -- did you have an understanding as
2   to where that pressure to find out more was coming from?
3       A    Well, you know, I assumed that he had the conversation
4   with Mr. Trump; and he -- and Mr. Trump was asking Michael
5   Cohen, "Did we hear anything yet?"
6       This is only a theory on my part.
7       I did not speak to Mr. Trump.
8       Q    Not until you were in New Jersey and you got that
9   call?
10       A    That's correct.
11                 THE COURT:  Is this a good time to break?
12                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think it's probably a good
13        time to break, yes.
14                 THE COURT:  All right, jurors.  We're going to go
15        ahead and call it a day, as we discussed.
16                 Before I excuse you, I remind you not to talk
17        among yourselves or anyone else about anything related to
18        the case.
19                 Please keep an open mind.
20                 Do not form or express an opinion about the
21        defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is
22        in, I have given you my final instructions on the law, and
23        I have directed you to begin deliberations.
24                 Do not accept, request, agree to accept, or
25        discuss with any person receipt or acceptance of any

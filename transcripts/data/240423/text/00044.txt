Hearing — Mr. Blanche
Page 981
1 position that at the time that he reposted anything to one
2 of his accounts, he did not believe that he was violating
3 the Gag Order?
4 I would like to hear that.
5 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor ——
6 THE COURT: I would like to hear that.
7 Or do you want me to accept it just because you're
8 saying it?
9 MR. BLANCHE: No, I don't expect you to accept it
10 because I'm just saying that.
11 But what I would like you to look at here, your
12 Honor, is that there is a history of posting and reposting
13 that have gone unchecked.
14 And I agree with you that the People have a right
15 to choose when they want to and when they don't want to
16 bring an Order to Show Cause, but that certainly goes to
17 whether the Court can find that it's willful, the fact that
18 President Trump hasn't done it ——
19 THE COURT: I just want to make you aware that the
20 People presented 10 exhibits. They indicated what their
21 case law is.
22 I understand what your position is.
23 The People have presented that case law; you have
24 no obligation, of course, but you have presented nothing.
25 MR. BLANCHE: No, your Honor, we are in the middle

1   interview, and I'll call you as soon as I know."
2       Q    I keep coming back to your pronouns because I want to
3   make sure I know who you're talking about.
4       Who did you have these multiple calls with? Who kept
5   calling you and asking you about this?
6       A    I'm sorry.
7       Michael Cohen kept calling me and asking me.
8       Q    You said that the interview that Dylan Howard
9   conducted with Karen McDougal was in Los Angeles on
10   January 20th; is that right?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Did you speak with Michael Cohen on that day, during
13   the time that Ms. McDougal was being interviewed by Dylan?
14       A    Yes.
15       Michael called me to find out if I heard from Dylan yet.
16       I said, "No." I said, "When I hear from him, I'll set up a
17   call for the three of us, and Dylan can tell you exactly what
18   he's going to tell me."
19       Q    How would you describe Michael Cohen's tone during
20   those calls?
21       A    Michael was very agitated. It looked like he was
22   getting a lot of pressure to get the answer, like, right away.
23       Q    What makes you say that?
24       A    He kept on calling; and each time he called, he seemed
25   more anxious.

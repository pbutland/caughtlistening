Hearing - Mr. Blanche

1       said and put it in quotes; am I right?
2                MR. BLANCHE:  It was, I wouldn't use the word
3       manipulation, your Honor, but the rest of the quote is not
4       part of the quote.
5                THE COURT:  Okay.  My other question is, this is
6       not a repost at all?
7                MR. BLANCHE:  No.
8                THE COURT:  No.  This is something that was said on
9       TV and your client had to type it out.
10                He had to sit there, use the quotation marks, the
11       shift key and type everything out, and then add those
12       additional words.
13                So your argument that these are reposts and,
14       therefore, they are not a violation, that does not apply to
15       Exhibit Number 10; is it?
16                MR. BLANCHE:  Number 10 is not a repost, agreed.
17                THE COURT:  So what is your argument as to
18       Exhibit 10?
19                MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, the argument as to Exhibit 10,
20       it's ambiguous whether this statement violates the Gag
21       Order.
22                Again, we have to find a willful violation of the
23       Gag Order beyond a reasonable doubt.

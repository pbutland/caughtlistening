1   audience of the National Enquirer and the other celebrity
2   magazines loved Mr. Trump as a major celebrity and followed it,
3   followed him religiously, I should say.
4       Then I would add on that all of the -- a lot of content on
5   the show, whether somebody was going to be fired or terminated
6   or there was some controversy he would have, as the publisher,
7   Mr. Trump was kind enough to give me the information first; so
8   it was very beneficial for my magazines.  And that ran from 2004
9   to 2014.
10       Q    And just to put that in a little bit of context, I'm
11   not sure you said this, but did The Apprentice show involve
12   several contestants that were competing to be hired by
13   Mr. Trump?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    But even though they hadn't been hired, as people were
16   eliminated as the show went on, he would say "You are fired,"
17   and they would basically be eliminated from the show; is that
18   correct?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Now, did there come a point during the relationship and
21   the way it evolved that you just described that you came to
22   consider Mr. Trump a friend?
23       A    Yes, I did.
24       Q    And during the period from 2015 to 2017, did you
25   consider Mr. Trump a friend?

1       Cohen, in particularly, and also Ms. Daniels, have ramped
2       up their political attacks and their attacks on him as a
3       candidate in the weeks leading up to the trial as well.
4                 THE COURT:  It is the timing that has me a little
5       bit confused.  You referred to repeated attacks.
6                 Yet, this first exhibit didn't happen until, was
7       it the day after the matter was brought to the Appellate
8       Division?
9                 So your client waited until after, the day after
10       the matter was brought to the Appellate Division, and the
11       stay was denied, to decide if he would respond, not to a
12       recent attack, but to a series of attacks -- can you
13       understand why I am curious about that -- rather than
14       responding a day before or two days before or three days
15       before?
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  The timing of the response, your
17       Honor, appreciating it was a day after the Appellate
18       Division, when we were in the Appellate Division, they were
19       alluding to today.
20                 One of our main arguments was that we would be
21       here for this kind of issue.  That there was something
22       ambiguous about what it would mean to attack a witness, a
23       foreseeable witness, but, your Honor, not about the
24       criminal proceeding of why they are here.
25                 And so, your Honor, I appreciate the question

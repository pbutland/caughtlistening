1       that needs to be given at that time.
2                The People have indicated that they might be
3       offered for something other than what that says, so we will
4       just need to customize it.
5                MR. BOVE:  And I guess then the question is, are
6       they coming in today?
7                And how should we address that in the flow of the
8       presentation?
9                MR. STEINGLASS:  Do you want me to answer that?
10                THE COURT:  Sure.
11                MR. STEINGLASS:  I believe we will get to them
12       today, but I think we had extensive colloquy on this matter
13       last Monday when we argued why they should be admissible.
14                And there is a host of reasons why they should be
15       admissible.
16                And this kind of gets to the point that we made in
17       our response last night, which is that, you know, the
18       defendant is really not entitled to seriatim limiting
19       instructions every time we introduce a piece of evidence.
20                I don't think there is any law that requires that
21       to be the case.
22                I don't think they provided any law; the case that
23       they provided doesn't stand for that proposition.
24                And so I think that we can tinker with the,
25       whatever limiting instructions are appropriate at the time

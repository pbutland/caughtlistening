1                 MR. BLANCHE:  He is asking whether Mr. Pomerantz
2       has been prosecuted for violating Grand Jury secrecy rules.
3                 THE COURT:  Why?  Pardon me.
4                 Why?  Why does he have to bring up a witness he
5       knows is a witness?
6                 MR. BLANCHE:  No.  Mr. Pomerantz is not a
7       witness.
8                 THE COURT:  He is not on the witness list?
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  No.  I believe they are complaining
10       about this one, your Honor, the third line down, has
11       disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted
12       for lying.
13                 That is what I was addressing when I said that
14       the objection and the statement there has nothing to do
15       with this case.  It has to do with the system and the fact
16       that President Trump very strongly believes that the People
17       should have prosecuted Mr. Cohen for lying, just like they
18       prosecuted --
19                 THE COURT:  So he is attacking Mr. Michael
20       Cohen's credibility just like he was attacking Stormy
21       Daniels' credibility.
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  No.  He is attacking the People and
23       system for not prosecuting Mr. Cohen for lying.
24                 Right.  Look, that's been a theme that President
25       Trump talked about repeatedly and for good reason.  It

2                      (The following occurred in open court:)
3                 THE COURT:  Two matters have been called into the
4       record.
5                 On April 15th, the People asked this Court to
6       sign an Order to Show Cause related to allegations that the
7       defendant had violated the Gag Order on three occasions.
8                 On April 18th, the People filed another Order to
9       Show Cause alleging that the defendant had violated the Gag
10       Order on seven other occasions.
11                 The purpose of this hearing is to find out
12       whether the defendant, Mr. Trump, should be held in
13       contempt of court for one or all of these alleged
14       violations.
15                 I believe it is the People's burden.  I will hear
16       you.
17                 MR. CONROY:  Thank you, Judge.
18                 Is it all right, I am going to use the podium?
19                 THE COURT:  Of course.
20                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, as an initial matter, I am
21       going to hand to the Court, and to counsel, a set of
22       documents.  The documents numbered 1 through 10 are the
23       alleged violations.
24                 They are all documents that were part of my
25       affirmation, but just to make this part of the record of

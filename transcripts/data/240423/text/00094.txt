1 Five Secret Mistresses?"
2 A. I don't remember the details of it, but I remember the
3 article.
4 Q. Do you remember discussing it with Michael Cohen prior
5 to its publication?
6 A. We would have discussed it, yes.
7 Q. I am going to show you one more from this exhibit,
8 which is 153B, Page 5, top headline, "Donald Trump Blasts Ted
9 Cruz's Dad for Photo with JFK Assassin."
10 Do you remember anything about the history behind this
11 article?
12 A. Yes. Dylan Howard had the Research Department take a
13 look at Ted Cruz's father's photos, and we matched the photos in
14 every different picture with that of Lee Harvey Oswald, and we
15 matched the two together. That's how that story was prepared
16 and created, I should say.
17 Q. And these articles that pertain to Ted Cruz, are they
18 mostly around the Spring of 2016?
19 A. May I see that?
20 Q. (Handing)
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. I am talking about the whole bunch of them. If you
23 want, we can flip through them just to make sure you are
24 comfortable answering that.
25 A. Yes.

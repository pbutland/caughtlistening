Hearing - Mr. Conroy

1                 THE COURT:  You can move on.
2                 MR. CONROY:  The burden here is on us to show the
3       existence of a lawful order expressing an unequivocal
4       mandate, a violation of the order, and that the violation
5       was made with knowledge and is willful beyond a reasonable
6       doubt.
7                 The Court's Order of April 1st, is clear and
8       unequivocal and it is lawful.  It has been challenged a
9       couple of times here and it was challenged in the First
10       Department.  A stay was denied.
11                 One of the bases for issuing a stay would be
12       possibility or likelihood of success.  That stay was
13       denied.  There is ongoing litigation there, but right now
14       this is a lawful order in front of this Court.
15                 He violates the order when he posts about known
16       witnesses or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning
17       their participation in this criminal proceeding and he
18       violates the order when he posts about a juror or
19       prospective juror.
20                 And, Judge, that language is a broad prohibition
21       with respect to the jurors, about statements about the jury
22       here.  It is not limited to a statement about a
23       particularly identifiable juror.
24                 Counsel in their papers inserts the word,
25       individual, in the filing on page seven in an effort to

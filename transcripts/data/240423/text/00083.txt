1 A. No, they weren't put into writing. It was just an
2 agreement among friends.
3 Q. Roughly, how long would you say this meeting lasted?
4 A. Twenty to 25 minutes.
5 Q. Did you discuss this meeting with anyone afterwards?
6 A. Yes. When I went back to my office —— as a matter of
7 fact, I went immediately back to my office and I met with Dylan
8 Howard. I mentioned his name yesterday. He was the Chief
9 Content Officer of the company, and the Editor—in—Chief of the
10 National Enquirer. I described to him the meeting I just had
11 with Mr. Trump and Michael Cohen, and I described to him that
12 this concept and agreement that I made has to be highly, highly
13 confidential.
14 So what I asked him to do was, I said —— I asked him to
15 notify the West Coast Bureau Chief of the National Enquirer, his
16 name was Jerry George, and I asked him to notify the East Coast
17 Bureau Chief of the National Enquirer, his name is Barry Levine,
18 and I said that any stories that are out there that are
19 commenting about Donald Trump, commenting about his family,
20 commenting about the election, whatever it might be, I want you
21 to vet the stories, I want you to bring them to me.
22 And then I said, we'll have to speak to Michael Cohen.
23 You will call Michael Cohen, or I will call him, and we'll tell
24 him what the stories are, but I want to make sure we vet them
25 first.

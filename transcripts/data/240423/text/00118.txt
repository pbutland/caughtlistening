1                 A business record is a business record if it's
2        between two people.
3                 THE COURT:  We don't need to get bogged down with
4        that.
5                 All I care about:  Is there hearsay or isn't
6        there hearsay?
7                 MR. STEINGLASS: The reason I'm saying that two
8        AMI employees having a text about a particular story like
9        the Dino Sajudin story, that is admissible hearsay --
10                 THE COURT:  It doesn't matter that he's not here
11        testifying.
12                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Both of them.
13                 THE COURT:  Right.
14                 It doesn't matter, provided that they come in
15        under some other exception.
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Okay.
17                 THE COURT:  Because it would still be hearsay,
18        even if it's a business record.
19                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Well, okay.
20                 But, I will say a couple of things.
21                 First, I think that there -- that the fact that
22        it's a business record may mean that conversations among
23        employees about business-related matters are admissible
24        because they're business records, even if -- otherwise,
25        there would be no business record.

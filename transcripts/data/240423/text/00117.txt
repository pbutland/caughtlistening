1        embedded hearsay in some of those, I think what the
2        defense needs to do is identify those portions of the
3        exhibits that they believe is embedded hearsay, and then
4        we can have argument as to whether or not there's a valid
5        hearsay objection.
6                 But, we've laid a foundation they're admissible
7        as business records.
8                 To the extent --
9                 THE COURT:  There is.
10                 They're admissible as business records.  There's
11        no dispute with that.
12                 But, if it's hearsay, it's still hearsay, and you
13        still have to get it out.
14                 I don't think the solution now is to send the
15        defense back to look through each one of these exhibits.
16                 If you know any one you're offering contains
17        hearsay, maybe you can make it easier for all of us.
18                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Well, (laughs), I don't mean to
19        be laughing, Judge.
20                 There's a lot of exhibits here, and there is a
21        lot of texts back and forth.
22                 It's our position that, primarily -- there's one
23        thing that Mr. Bove said that I very much don't agree
24        with, which is that there's some relevance to whether the
25        declarant is present.

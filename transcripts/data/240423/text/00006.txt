Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 943
1 order, your Honor, was issued because after the March 26th
2 order the defendant ratcheted up attacks on family members
3 who were not covered by that March 26th order.
4 Among other things, the April 1st order prevents
5 the Defendant from making or directing others to make
6 public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable
7 witnesses concerning their potential participation in the
8 investigation or in this criminal proceeding.
9 And in a second relevant provision, prevents the
10 defendant from making or directing others to make public
11 statements about any prospective juror or any juror in this
12 criminal proceeding.
13 The defendant was warned that he would face
14 sanctions under Judiciary Law 750, (a) (3) and 751 if he
15 violated, and here we are.
16 Judge, I am going to go through the violations of
17 the 10 posts that I just handed up.
18 The first violation was on April 10, 2024, at
19 10:07 a.m. The defendant published a post on his Truth
20 Social account that reproduced a social media post by
21 Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer of Stormy Daniels who
22 was later convicted of stealing from her.
23 The Avenatti post stated, we can't be hypocrites
24 when it comes to the First Amendment. It is outrageous
25 that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews, post

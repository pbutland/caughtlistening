1       on social and make money on bogus documentaries, all by
2       talking shit about Trump, but he's gagged and threatened
3       with jail if he responds.
4                 To that the defendant added in his own words,
5       thank you to Michael Avenatti for revealing the truth about
6       two sleazebags who have with their lies and
7       misrepresentations cost our country dearly.
8                 The second post that same day --
9                 THE COURT:  If I can interrupt for one second.
10                 Can you make the connection between that post and
11       the conditions of the Gag Order specifically, so what you
12       already read, making or directing others to make public
13       statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses
14       concerning the potential participation in the investigation
15       or in this criminal proceeding?
16                 Can you connect that for me?
17                 MR. CONROY:  Well, the first part of that,
18       clearly Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen are known or
19       reasonably foreseeable witnesses here.  I think that's been
20       clear for a long time; and by calling them sleazebags, by
21       going after their credibility, I think that's all part of
22       the plan for this trial, and there is no other reason to be
23       talking about that then related to this.
24                 It's five days before we are going to be here to
25       pick a jury.  It's the defendant conditioning his followers

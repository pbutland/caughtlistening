1       A    Um, I pursued the story after -- I pursued the story.
2       That's what he said. We pursued the story.
3       Q    Did you discuss the purchase of the story with Michael
4   Cohen?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    Tell us about that conversation.
7       A    I called Michael Cohen up. I called Michael Cohen, and
8   I said that we have to go forward with the story.
9       And I -- he said, "How much?"
10       I said, "Dylan negotiated a price of $30,000."
11       So he said, "Who's gonna pay for it?"
12       So I said, "I'll pay for it. This can be a very big story.
13   I believe it's important that it should be removed from the
14   market. So we'll acquire the story."
15       And then he said, "Thank you very much." He thanked me. And
16   he said that The Boss would be very pleased.
17       Q    Who did you understand "The Boss" to be?
18       A    "The Boss" would be Donald Trump.
19       Q    Did you -- now, you said earlier that at some point
20   you -- it became clear to you that Michael Cohen had spoken
21   with Donald Trump about the Dino Sajudin story?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    Can you tell us, what makes you say that?
24       A    Because there was a second conversation, after that,
25   where he called and said that the story is absolutely not true.

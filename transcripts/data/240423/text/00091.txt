1   it the campaign?
2       A.   Yes.
3       Q.   So back to Exhibits 153A, B and C.
4            My question is:  Do these documents contain different
5   headlines for stories about various opponents that Trump was
6   facing in the various primaries that were published in the
7   National Enquirer in the months following your August 2015
8   meeting with Mr. Trump and Michael Cohen?
9       A.   That's correct.
10       Q.   And do the headlines correspond to actual stories run
11   in the National Enquirer during that time period?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And are the dates contained under each of those
14   headlines accurate?
15       A.   Yes, they are.
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I offer them into evidence.
17                 MR. BOVE:  No objection, subject to the same
18        limiting instruction.
19                 THE COURT:  People's Exhibits 153A, B and C are
20        accepted into evidence with the same caveat.
21                 At this time they're being admitted for the
22        limited purpose of demonstrating that the article was
23        published on or about a certain date, and to provide
24        context for the other exhibit.  The exhibit is not in
25        evidence for the truth of the matters asserted.

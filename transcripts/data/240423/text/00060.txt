2                THE COURT:  Indicating Mr. Trump.
3                MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you, Judge.
4       Q    How did you meet the defendant?
5       A    I met the -- I met Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago.  A client
6   of mine, Ronald Perelman, introduced me to a fellow by the name
7   of Nick Ribis.  This is all at Mar-a-Lago.
8       And he invited -- Nick invited me to Mar-a-Lago, and he
9   introduced me to Mr. Trump.
10       And Nick was the, at that time, if I recollect, he was the
11   President of Resorts Casinos, one of Mr. Trump's hotels and
12   casinos.
13       Q    And do you remember about when that was?
14       A    I think, I would say that would be in the 80s, '88 or
15   '89.
16       Q    Can you describe your relationship with Mr. Trump over
17   the years for the jury?
18       A    Yes.  I have had a great relationship with Mr. Trump
19   over the years, starting in the -- when, starting in '89, I had
20   an idea of creating a magazine called Trump Style, and I
21   presented it to Mr. Trump.
22       And he liked the idea a lot, and just questioned me who was
23   going to pay for it, because magazines are pretty expensive.
24       So I told him, I said, Mr. Trump, you have all of these
25   hotels, all of these casinos, all of these apartments, you

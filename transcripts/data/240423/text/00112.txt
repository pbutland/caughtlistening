1 Q And, very generally speaking, how is that
2 accomplished?
3 A The IT Department —— the Legal Department would put a
4 legal hold, send it to the IT Department, and the IT Director
5 would send —— would actually put a hold on all of the
6 content —— all of the content that was related to that case or
7 that issue. And you would receive a letter from Legal
8 Department telling you that this is being done.
9 Q When you say "IT", is that information technology?
10 A Sorry.
11 Information Technology.
12 Sorry about that.
13 Q It's okay.
14 So, during those instances where it became necessary to
15 take the texts from the employees' phones, did AMI have the
16 ability to physically take possession of those phones to
17 download or otherwise forensically image the texts that were
18 the subject of the litigation hold?
19 A Yes.
20 The Legal Department would actually call and ask for the
21 phone. And they would take —— they would do it from there with
22 the IT —— with the Information Technology Department.
23 Q Right.
24 Thank you.
25 Are texts used, in part, to conduct AMI business?

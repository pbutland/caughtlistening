1 THE COURT: Yes. Yes, it is.
2 MR. BLANCHE: All right.
3 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. See you later.
4 All right.
5 I'm sorry, before you step out, I did receive your
6 separate submission regarding the proposed limiting
7 instruction as to the Wall Street Journal articles, and the
8 limiting instruction regarding AMI.
9 The AMI limiting instruction that I came up with is
10 really just a combination of the two; I took some from one
11 and I took some from the other.
12 The limiting instructions to the Wall Street
13 Journal article, I basically adopted the defendant's version
14 of that.
15 I will —— I have made copies, and I will hand down
16 copies when I come back at 11.
17 Thank you.
18 MR. CONROY: Judge, one other thing, I said I would
19 hand up a case. And I have a copy for the Court and I have
20 a copy for counsel.
21 Thank you.
22 THE COURT: Thank you.
23 (Recess taken.)

3       Q.   Prior to that August 2015 meeting, had you ever
4   purchased a story to not print it about Mr. Trump?
5       A.   No.
6       Q.   Now, that part of the deal where you were going to
7   notify them so they could buy up negative information about Mr.
8   Trump, that part, did that part help the National Enquirer at
9   all.  How was that going to boost sales of the National
10   Enquirer?
11       A.   No, that didn't help.  That is the mutual benefit
12   portion of it.
13       Q.   Except that part doesn't have a mutual benefit.  The
14   purpose of that component was to benefit the campaign; am I
15   understanding you right?
16       A.   That is right.
17       Q.   But the part about running the positive stories, that
18   was mutually beneficial?
19       A.   Yes, the part about running the tabloid stories on the
20   opponents, that was mutually beneficial.
21       Q.   Were any of the agreements, the agreement to print the
22   negative stories about the opponents, positive stories from
23   Trump, or the agreement to notify Michael Cohen about
24   potentially negative stories about Donald Trump, were any of
25   those agreements put into writing?

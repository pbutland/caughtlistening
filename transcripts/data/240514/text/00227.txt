1                 Given that it is not yet opened, I would caution
2        that if he is asking all about those meetings, those
3        meetings did not have to do with the case.
4                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am not asking him about the
5        specifics of what he spoke to the District Attorney about
6        in February.  I am asking if he did meet with them.
7                 MS. HOFFINGER:  The implication is that he met
8        with them to discuss the case.
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  If it doesn't open the door, I am
10        happy to make it crystal clear it wasn't about this case.
11        It was about a different investigation.  I don't want to
12        open the door.
13                 THE COURT:  You can clarify it wasn't about the
14        case, and that won't open the door.  That is fine.  That
15        will not open the door.
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  I will clean that up.
17                 THE COURT:  One person at a time.
18                 If you clarify it was not about the case, that
19        will not open the door.
20                 MR. BLANCHE:  Okay.
21                 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:)

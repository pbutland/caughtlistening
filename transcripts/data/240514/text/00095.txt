17   privileged.
18            "I spoke with Rudy.  Very, very positive.  You are
19   loved.  If you want to call me, I will give you the details.
20   I told him everything you asked me to and he said they knew
21   that.  There was never a doubt, and they are in our corner.
22   Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained.  He
23   called it crucial and noted how reassured they were that they
24   had someone like me who Rudy has known for so many years in this
25   role.  Sleep well tonight.  You have friends in high places."

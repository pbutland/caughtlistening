1   about it?
2                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
3                THE COURT:  Overruled.
4       A    That's how I recall it, yes.
5       Q    So they don't direct you not to speak, they just say
6   it's probably better you don't speak?
7       A    Well, I do have the First Amendment right.  I can
8   speak.
9       Q    I'm not asking you about your First Amendment rights,

21       A    I don't think so, no.
22       Q    So fewer than five times?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And on all those five times, they said something like,
25   it's probably better you don't talk or don't talk to the press;

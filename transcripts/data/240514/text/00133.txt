M. Cohen — Direct/Hoffinger
3636
1 I had 80 percent equity in my home. And the same bank had
2 the mortgage. It’s supposed to be a line of credit based off of
3 your home's equity. There was ten times coverage.
4 So, I didn’t believe that it should have been brought as a
5 charge, either, based upon materiality.
6 I’d had a HELOC on that same property for ten years, just
7 with a different institution.
8 Q Are you disputing that there was an omission, however,
9 in the HELOC application submitted to the bank?
10 A No, ma’am.
11 Q So, there was an omission?
12 A There was.
13 Q And you just don’t believe you should have been
14 criminally prosecuted?
15 A Correct.
16 Q For that offense?
17 A Correct.
18 Q Nevertheless, did you take responsibility for those
19 two crimes?
20 A I did.
21 Q And you paid the taxes that were owed?
22 A Paid the taxes, paid the fines, paid everything.
23 Q And you served time in prison?
24 A And served time in prison.
25 In fact, I remain, even today, still on supervised release.

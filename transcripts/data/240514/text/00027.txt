M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3530
1       A    This invoice was for the month of June.  It states:
2   June 16th of 2017.  Invoice.  Mr. Allen Weisselberg, care of
3   Donald J. Trump.  725 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10022.
4        "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly
5   remit payment for services rendered for the month of May, 2017
6   and June, 2017."
7         It listed, again, "May, 2017 $35,000" and "June of 2017,
8   $35,000.  Thank you."
9       Q    Now, you listed two months in that.
10       Is that because you had not yet received the check for May?
11       A    That's correct.  I believe it was lost.
12       Q    And does this invoice falsely state that it's for
13   services rendered during the months of May and June pursuant to
14   a Retainer Agreement?
15       A    Yes, ma'am.
16       Q    Thank you.
17                MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down and now put
18       up People's Exhibit 16.
19                (Displayed.)
20       Q    Did you receive this check for $35,000 in response to
21   the false invoice you sent that we just looked at in People's
22   Exhibit 37E?
23       A    Yes, ma'am.
24       The check and the stub.
25       Q    And can you see whose signature is on the check?

1 Q And, actually, specifically, did they reach out to you
2 about a FEC Complaint about AMI’s payoff of Karen McDougal?
3 A Yes.
4 Q And do you recall what The Wall Street Journal was
5 asking you about in connection with that?
6 A AMI’s participation in the payoff.
7 Q And were they asking you also about anybody else's
8 involvement in that payoff, other than AMI?
9 A David Pecker.
10 Q Were they asking at all about your involvement or
11 Mr. Trump's involvement?
12 A Yes.
13 Q Did you speak to Mr. Pecker around that time about the
14 PEG Complaint that AMI had received?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Can you tell the jury about, generally, what was
17 discussed between yourself and Mr. Pecker?
18 A So, David was very concerned because it was going to
19 affect AMI. It was going to affect him.
20 And so, I had told him that I would assist with this
21 matter.
22 And I, ultimately, told him that after conversations
23 with the President, do not worry. We have this thing under
24 control. It’s going to be taken care of.

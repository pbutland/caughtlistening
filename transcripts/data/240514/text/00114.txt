14 good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the
15 services of Michael Cohen."
16 Then put out another one: "I feel very badly for Paul
17 Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12—year old
18 tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on
19 him, and unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break, make up
20 stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a brave man."

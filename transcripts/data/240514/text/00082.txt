1       Q    Did you speak with President Trump shortly after these
2   search warrants were executed?
3       A    I did.
4       Q    Can you explain the conversation?
5            Can you describe the conversation you had with then
6   President Trump?
7       A    I received a phone call from President Trump in
8   response to me leaving a message for him to call me.  I wanted,
9   obviously, him to know what was taking place.
10            And he said to me:  Don't worry.  I am the President
11   of the United States.  There is no -- there is nothing here.
12   Everything is going to be okay.  Stay tough.  You are going to
13   be okay.
14       Q    Have you spoken directly with Mr. Trump since that
15   time?
16       A    No, ma'am.
17       Q    Was your call from President Trump at that time
18   important to you?
19       A    Extremely important.
20       Q    Why was it important?
21       A    Because I wanted -- first of all, I was scared.
22            This was the first time in my life anything like this
23   happened, and I wanted some reassurance that Mr. Trump had my
24   back.  Especially as -- especially his help with issues that
25   related to him.

1                MS. HOFFINGER:  And you also gave us notice of Alan
2       Garten.
3                MR. BLANCHE:  No, we don't anticipate the calling
4       of Alan Garten.
5                THE COURT:  So, if I understand you correctly, your
6       only witness on defense, that you know of right now, is the
7       expert possibly?
8                MR. BLANCHE:  Correct.
9                THE COURT:  And maybe not.
10                MR. BLANCHE:  And maybe not.
11                Honestly, Judge, depending on how that conversation
12       goes, because of the limited nature of his testimony, we may
13       not call him.
14                THE COURT:  Okay.
15                MR. BLANCHE:  And we will, obviously, let them know
16       to save the flight of their expert.
17                THE COURT:  Well, we can certainly have that
18       conversation to assist you in making your decision.
19                MR. BLANCHE:  Absolutely, sure.
20                MS. HOFFINGER:  One other quick issue.
21                We gave notice to defense counsel on Sunday of
22       incidents that we intended to seek to admit with Mr. Cohen.
23                 There were -- defense counsel has not objected to
24       any of them, but with respect to two, indicated that they
25       would be seeking a limiting instruction.

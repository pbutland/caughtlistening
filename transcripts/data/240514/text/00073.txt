1       previously instructed them upon why the AMI evidence came
2       in and that instruction still applies.
3                 THE COURT:  Okay.
4                      (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the
5                 following occurred in open court.)
6                 THE COURT:  So, Jurors, you may recall that I
7       previously gave you an instruction regarding AMI.
8                 The testimony that you just heard now is
9       consistent with my previous instructions that that evidence
10       was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David
11       Pecker's credibility and to help provide context for some
12       other surrounding events.
13                 You may consider that testimony and what you just
14       heard for those purposes only.
15                 Mr. Blanche, is that satisfactory?
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you, your Honor.
17   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
18       Q    Mr. Cohen, just getting back to where we left off in
19   my questions.
20            In terms of the substance of your conversation with
21   David Pecker about his receipt of the Complaint from the FEC,
22   did you tell him that someone in particular in the
23   administration would be able to assist in that manner?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    What did you tell him?

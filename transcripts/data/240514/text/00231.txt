1   work that I had done while I was at Otisville.  In terms of work
2   and program and credits, I should have been entitled to a year,
3   but I received none of that either.
4       Q.   Just so we understand, you're saying that you believe
5   that there had been a calculation that was done by the Bureau of
6   Prisons that maybe wasn't accurate, you were entitled to be
7   released earlier; is that what you are testifying to?
8       A.   Pursuant to the Bureau of Prisons you get what's called
9   work credits as well as education credits, to which I took.  I
10   put in an application to the Bureau of Prisons as well, which

13       Q.   But, correct me if I am wrong, one of the reasons why

18   early, even though prison was different, you weren't in
19   Otisville, you were just at home; right?
20       A.   I did want to be released, yes.
21       Q.   And you talked about this on direct, but, ultimately,
22   there was no letter or public announcement made by the District
23   Attorney about your cooperation; correct?
24       A.   That's correct.
25       Q.   So, again, talking about the 2021 timeframe, you are

1       one?
2                      (Displayed.)
3       A    I didn't get a response, or the response I was looking
4   for.  So, I asked him to please call me:  Can you call me,
5   please?
6            I still didn't hear from him so, I respond again:
7   Please call me.
8       Q    Then?
9       A    Then followed by:  Anything?  With a question mark.
10            And his response finally to me:  Was still trying.
11       Q    And the next text.
12       A    And I then followed up and said:  This is no good.  We
13   need her as -- by doing tomorrow.  You just create another news
14   circle instead of putting an end to this one.
15            And then, again, I am asking him to please call me.
16            And persistence:  Come on.
17            I still hadn't heard from him.
18            I then respond:  Let's forget tonight.  They would
19   rather tomorrow so they can promote the heck out of the show.
20            Followed by me writing to Keith:  Keith, the wise men
21   all believe the story is dying and don't think it's smart for
22   her to do any interviews.  Let her do her thing but no
23   interviews at all with anyone.
24            His response to me:  100 percent.
25            I respond:  Thanks Pal.

1       check stubs.
2       Q    It says "Retainer for January 1, 2017 through
3   January 30th, 2017, and retainer for February 1, 2017 through
4   February 28th, 2017."
5       Again, was there a retainer -- was this a retainer for those
6   months?
7       A    No, ma'am.
8       Q    And was the check -- were the descriptions here on this
9   check stub false?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    And, again, there was no Retainer Agreement; is that
12   right?
13       A    That's correct.
14                MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we take a look at the signature
15       on the check now.
16                Blow that up.
17                (Displayed.)
18       Q    Do you recognize the signatures on the check?
19       A    Yes, ma'am.
20       Q    Whose do you recognize them to be?
21       A    The one on the top, I believe, is Eric Trump's, and the
22   one on the bottom is Allen Weisselberg.
23       Q    And who is the check from?  In other words, what
24   account is it drawn on?
25       A    The check is drawn from Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust

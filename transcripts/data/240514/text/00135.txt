M. Cohen — Direct/Hoffinger
3638
1 the People represented to your Honor that it was argument.
2 And now they’re trying to elicit it from this
3 witness on direct.
4 I am definitely getting into it on cross.
5 This seems appropriate for them on redirect, not
6 on direct.
7 I wasn't able to open on this. The objection was
8 sustained on this.
9 MS. HOFFINGER: I just intend to elicit why he
10 told the Court under cross—examination that he had lied to
11 Judge Pauley in terms of his criminal plea. That's all.
12 I’m not getting into anything further, but I'm
13 going to have him explain why he told —— he testified in
14 that case that he had lied to Judge Pauley.
15 It’s consistent with what he testified to.
16 MR. BLANCHE: I'm not trying to cry over spilled
17 milk.
18 That was exactly what was sustained on opening,
19 that he had lied under oath to Judge Pauley.
20 MS. HOFFINGER: You said "committed perjury".
21 THE COURT: You called him a "perjurer" when he
22 said that.
23 I think you did.
24 MR. BLANCHE: He admitted he committed perjury.
25 MS. HOFFINGER: He did not.

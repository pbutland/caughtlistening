M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3655
1       A    I have been on CNN and -- I have watched CNN and MSNBC,
2   but not religiously, in order to follow the full extent of the
3   trial.
4       Q    And you have said that you are watching on CNN and
5   MSNBC -- maybe not all the time -- about some of the things that
6   are happening during this trial; correct?
7       A    I have turned it on, yes.
8       Q    And that's because this trial is important to you;
9   correct?
10       A    I do it because at times there are other issues as well
11   that I'm interested in seeing what's happening, like the
12   protests or Israel and this issue comes up as well.
13       Q    Well, is this trial important to you, Mr. Cohen?
14       A    Personally, yes.
15       Q    You also talked on social media during this trial about
16   President Trump; have you not?
17       A    Sounds correct, yes.
18       Q    So, for example, on April 23rd, which is after the
19   trial started; correct?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    You referred to President Trump as a "Dictator Douche
22   Bag;" didn't you?
23       A    Sounds like something I said.
24       Q    And on that same TikTok, so again on April 23rd, you
25   referred to President Trump when he left the courtroom, you said

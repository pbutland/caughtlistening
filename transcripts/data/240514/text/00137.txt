M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger

1       A    Yes.
2       Q    Can you explain, very briefly, what you meant when you
3   said, yes, you lied to Judge Pauley when you took that criminal
4   plea to those counts in 2018?
5       A    What I was saying: I was going to take responsibility
6   because the underlying fact I have never disputed.
7       But, it goes back, again, to the issue that I was given
8   48 hours to accept their plea offer or they were going to file
9   an 80-page indictment that included my wife.
10       And I was going to protect my wife.
11       Q    And, now, just to make sure that I'm clear, you've
12   never said that you lied to Judge Pauley about your plea to the
13   two campaign finance violations; is that right?
14                 MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.
15       A    That's correct.
16                 THE COURT:  Sustained as to form.
17                 The answer is stricken.
18       Q    Did you ever lie in connection with your guilty plea
19   or any other time about whether you were guilty of those
20   campaign finance violations?
21       A    No, ma'am.
22       Q    Mr. Cohen, are you still a practicing attorney?
23       A    No, ma'am.
24       Q    Why not?
25       A    I lost my law license as a direct result of this.

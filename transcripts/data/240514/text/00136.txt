3639
1                 He said he lied to Judge Pauley.
2                 THE COURT:  It was a fine line.
3                 It was the use of the word "perjury" or
4        "perjurer" that I sustained.
5                 MR. BLANCHE:  Fine.
6                 I withdraw my objection.
7                 I needed to get that off my chest.
8                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
9        in open court:)
10                 THE COURT:  The objection is withdrawn.
11       Q    Mr. Cohen, in particular, were you cross-examined
12   about statements that you've made about feeling that it was
13   unfair for you to have been criminally prosecuted for tax
14   evasion and a false statement to the bank?
15       A    Yes, ma'am.
16       Q    And did Mr. Trump's lawyers ask you -- withdrawn.
17       Did Mr. Trump's lawyers ask you if as a result of those
18   public statements you had made, that you had, therefore, lied
19   in August of 2018 before the Judge who took your plea, meaning
20   that you had lied in taking a criminal plea to tax evasion and
21   bank fraud?
22       A    Yes, they did ask that.
23       Q    Did you admit under questioning that, yes, you told
24   Judge Pauley that it was a lie when you agreed to plead guilty
25   to those counts?

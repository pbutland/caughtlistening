10 A. Yes.
11 Q. In substance, what did he tell you?
12 A. He said he had been at the Southern District of New
13 York. That he is incredibly close to Rudy Giuliani. And what
14 I mean by close, he means as close as you can imagine. And that
15 would be a relationship that would be very beneficial to you
16 going forward with this matter.
17 Q. Can you explain why that would be a beneficial
18 relationship for you?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. What did he say?
21 A. Because Mr. Giuliani at the time had a very close
22 relationship and was spending a tremendous amount of time with
23 President Trump.
24 Q. And did he speak to you about a back channel of
25 communications?

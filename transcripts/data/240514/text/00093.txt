14 Q. Can you tell the jury what this is, and walk us through
15 it?
16 A. This is an email that I received from Robert Costello
17 on Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 6:45 p.m. It is cc'd to Jeffrey
18 Citron as a followup:
19 "I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the
20 Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which
21 can be very, very useful for you. Bob Costello."
22 Q. What did you understand this email to be about?
23 A. To validate the relationship with Rudy that he
24 expressed to me. And, again, to re—enforce the whole concept of
25 the back channel.

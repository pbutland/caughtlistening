2 Q Now, and of those more than 200 episodes, would you

5 A I would say he is mentioned in every one, yes.
6 Q And in addition to the Podcasts, which we will talk
7 about a little bit more in a little bit, you also are active on

9 A That's correct.
10 Q And you are also active, although maybe more recently,
11 on TikTok; correct?
12 A Correct.
13 Q And TikTok, you do a nightly live TikTok; correct?
14 A Correct.
15 Q How long is that each night?
16 A More than an hour.
17 Q What's the goal of doing that?
18 A Build an audience to create a community, to really vent
19 because I am having a difficult time sleeping so I found an
20 outlet.
21 Q You are hoping also to make money off that; correct?
22 A It does make money, but it's not significant.
23 Q You don't spend a significant amount of time on your
24 TikToks encouraging the folks listening to subscribe?
25 A Yes.

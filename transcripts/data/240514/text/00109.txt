1       A.   I did.
2       Q.   What did that charge relate to?
3       A.   Stormy Daniels.
4       Q.   And did it relate to, specifically, your paying
5   $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to buy the life rights to her story
6   so that it would not be public and that it was done on behalf of
7   President Trump to influence the election?
8       A.   Yes.
9       Q.   Did you admit that you paid that money to Stormy
10   Daniels in order to influence Mr. Trump's electoral prospects?

19        If the question is:  Did you plead guilty?  Yes.  What did
20        you plead guilty to?  That's fair.  But just leading him
21        through the allegations --
22                 THE COURT:  That's fair.
23                 I apologize.  That's fair.  I was sustaining the
24        objection.
25                 And also let me know if you want a limiting

7 He asked me if I needed money, and I said, no, all good.
8 He said, because I can get a check.
9 And I said, no.
10 I said, I'm okay.

12 Allen.
13 Q Did he say anything about anything that would be
14 forthcoming?
15 A Excuse me?
16 Q Did he say anything about what would be forthcoming to
17 you?

22 Q And did you take any photos commemorating your visit to

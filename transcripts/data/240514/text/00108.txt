1   your family?
2       A.   Well, at that point in time we didn't even know what
3   the Southern District of New York was even looking at.  And the
4   conversations with my family was what to do.  We're in this
5   unique situation I never experienced.  And my family, my wife,
6   my daughter, my son, all said to me, why are you holding onto
7   this loyalty?  What are you doing?  We're supposed to be your
8   first loyalty?
9       Q.   So what decision did you make?
10       A.   That it was about time to listen to them.
11       Q.   What did you decide about where your loyalty should be
12   going forward?
13       A.   To my wife, my daughter, my son, and the country.
14       Q.   Let me direct your attention now to August 21, 2018.
15   Did you plead guilty on that day in a court in the Southern
16   District of New York to a number of federal crimes?
17       A.   I did.
18       Q.   By that time, in late August of 2018, what, if
19   anything, had you decided about whether you would continue to
20   lie for President Trump?
21       A.   I made a decision based on the conversation that I had
22   with my family, I would not lie for President Trump any longer.
23       Q.   And on August 21, 2018, did you plead guilty to one
24   count of making an excessive campaign contribution in violation
25   of the Federal Election Campaign Act?

1       A.   He also stated to me that this would be a great way to
2   have a back channel communication to the President in order to
3   ensure that you're still good and that you're still secure.
4       Q.   During that meeting, did you tell Mr. Costello the
5   truth about what Mr. Trump's role was in the payoff to Stormy
6   Daniels?
7       A.   No.
8       Q.   Why not?
9       A.   First, I wasn't sure that I was going to hire him.
10   There was something really sketchy and wrong about him.  He

12   pay that right now.  I am still speaking to other lawyers."
13            So I certainly wasn't going to expose anything to, one,
14   someone I didn't know, and two, I was having trouble connecting

17   information to him about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy
18   Daniels matter, that that information might go somewhere else?
19       A.   I was also concerned, again, when he started talking
20   about his incredibly close relationship to Rudy, that anything I
21   said to him was going to be spoken and told to Rudy Giuliani.
22   And, of course, because Rudy Giuliani at the time was so
23   proximate to Mr. Trump, President Trump, that anything that I
24   said would get back to him.
25       Q.   Did Mr. Costello mention anything to you about

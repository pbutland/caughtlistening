1   Otisville, about whether the District Attorney would be helping
2   to write the Rule 35 motion?
3       A.   My lawyers may have answered that.  I didn't ask for
4   it.
5       Q.   I didn't say that you did.
6           You were there when they were meeting with you, so while
7   you were there with your lawyers in the District Attorney's
8   office, do you remember a conversation where your lawyers asked
9   the District Attorney whether they would be willing to help with
10   the Rule 35 motion in Federal Court?
11       A.   I believe so, yes.
12       Q.   Is it fair to say -- I know this goes back a couple of
13   years -- but the District Attorney didn't commit to anything;
14   right?
15       A.   No, sir.
16       Q.   They didn't say, yes, we'll do it, but they didn't say,
17   no, we won't; they didn't commit; correct?
18       A.   That's correct.
19       Q.   So, eventually, you met with the District Attorney
20   again on September 19th for the second time in Otisville?
21       A.   They came to Otisville.
22       Q.   Then, again, on October 30th; correct?
23       A.   Yes, sir.
24       Q.   Then in December, your lawyers, in fact, did make a
25   Rule 35 motion in the Southern District of New York; correct?

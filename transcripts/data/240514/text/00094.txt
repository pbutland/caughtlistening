4       Q.   Can you read that email and also explain it to the
5   jury?
6       A.   It is from Robert Costello.  Again, to me.  Dated
7   Saturday, April 21, 2018, at 12:02 a.m.
8            Subject is:  Giuliani.
9            He writes:  Privileged and confidential.
10            "Michael, I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I
11   was on your team.  Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be
12   a better situation for the President or you.  He asked me if
13   it was okay to call the President and Jay Sekulow.  And I said,
14   fine."
15            "We discussed the facts, Jay Goldberg's stupid remarks,
16   et cetera."
17            He said:  "I can't tell you how pleased I am that I
18   could work with someone I know and trust.  He asked me to tell
19   you that he knows how tough this is on you and your family and
20   he will make sure -- to make sure to tell the President."
21            He said: "Thank you for opening this back channel of
22   communication and asked me to keep in touch."
23            "I told him I would after speaking to you further."
24           "Bob."
25       Q.   And, again, who is Jay Sekulow referenced in here as

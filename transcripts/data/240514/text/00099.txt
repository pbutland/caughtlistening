1 Subject: Forward update draft.
2 Again, it's sent to me.
3 Q. Can you read that first paragraph?
4 A. "Michael, since you jumped off the phone rather
5 abruptly, I did not get a chance to tell you that my friend has
6 communicated to me that he is meeting with his client this
7 evening."
8 And he added, "if there was anything you wanted to
9 convey, you should tell me and my friend will bring it up for
10 discussion this evening."
11 Q. Who did you understand his reference to be "my friend;"
12 in other words, who was "my friend" that he is meeting with,
13 his client this evening? Who did you understand that to be a
14 reference to?
15 A. Rudy Giuliani.
16 Q. Who would Mr. Gulani's client be?
17 A. Donald J. Trump, President Trump.
18 Q. Did you have some understanding about why he didn't
19 just say outright Rudy Giuliani and President Trump?
20 A. Sort of to be covert. It's all back channel sort of
21 spy—ish. Didn't want to put anybody's name. Why on this one as
22 opposed to this one? But, clearly, never mentioning President
23 Trump, using code words.
24 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the second
25 paragraph in the email.

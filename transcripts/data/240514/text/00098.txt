M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3601
1            "After you called me back at 2:43 p.m. and we spoke, I
2   called and left a message for Rudy at 2:55 New York time.  I
3   will let you know when I hear back from him."
4       Q.   What do you understand Mr. Costello communicating here
5   and what was going on at the time?
6       A.   He is demonstrating his close proximate relationship
7   to Rudy Giuliani.
8            Again, at this point in time I had not retained
9   Costello or advised him that I was going to be retaining him.
10            In order to stay in the fold, he was expressing to me
11   his obvious relationship to Rudy Giuliani who was proximate to
12   President Trump.
13                 MS. HOFFINGER:  If you can take that down.  Please
14        put up People's 207 in evidence.
15                 Thank you.
16                 Can we blow that up, the first paragraph.
17                 Is there a way to blow up first the first
18        paragraph?
19                 Can we see the date at the top of the email.  Can
20        we blow up the top of the e-mail for Mr. Cohen.
21                 (Displayed.)
22       Q.   Can you explain who it is from and who it is to and the
23   date?
24       A.   Again, from Robert Costello.  It's dated June 13 of
25   2018 at 3:21 p.m.

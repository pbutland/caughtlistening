1       A    That's what it says.
2       Q    And that's also a reference to President Trump;
3   correct?
4       A    Correct.
5       Q    So when you testified earlier today that you only sell
6   one thing on your -- merchandise that has to do with Donald
7   Trump, that's not true; correct?
8                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.

10       Q    And, by the way --

14       Q    You, actually -- if you look at that, the T-shirt, you
15   actually wore that T-shirt last week on your TikTok, didn't you,
16   on Wednesday night?
17       A    I did.
18       Q    And you were offering -- encouraging people to go buy
19   it; correct?
20       A    Yes.  It's part of the merch store.
21       Q    So, I want to talk for a few minutes -- you talked
22   about this a little bit on direct -- about your views of
23   President Trump prior to, I guess, August of 2018; is that
24   right?

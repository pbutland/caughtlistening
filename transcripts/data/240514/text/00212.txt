1   right.
2       You were sentenced December 12th of 2018; right?
3       A    Correct.
4       Q    And we're now in August of 2019; right?
5       A    (Nods yes).
6       Q    That we're talking about a meeting at the DA's Office;
7   right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    Are you familiar with a Rule 35 Motion in Federal
10   Court?
11       A    I am.
12       Q    And you understand that a Rule 35 Motion, at times,
13   gives the Judge who sentences you the right to give you a lower
14   sentence if certain things happen; like, potentially,
15   cooperation; right?
16       A    That was something that Judge Pauley issued in his
17   decision.
18       Q    And Judge Pauley is the Federal Judge who sentenced
19   you; right?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    So, you understood -- well -- but, you understood, did
22   you not, that a Rule 35 Motion has to be made within one year
23   of sentence unless certain privileges pertain, right, or apply?
24       A    At the time I did not know that, no.
25       Q    At the time -- well, did you later learn that?

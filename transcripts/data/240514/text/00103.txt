1 expressed clearly to Mr. Giuliani that he was on the team and
2 that he was going to be representing me. The concern here was

5 Q. What did you understand him to mean by "If you need to
6 communicate something, he would get it done," who did you
7 understand he was talking about communicating with?
8 A. To Rudy Giuliani. Ultimately, to reach President
9 Trump.
10 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.
11 You can take that down.
12 Please put up People's Exhibit 208. Blow up the

17 Hyperlink to a YouTube video. And he writes:
18 "Something you should see. Bob."
19 Q. And do you have a recollection of what that video that
20 he was sending you, what it was about, or did he disclose it in
21 a further part of this email?
22 A. I don’t.
23 MS. HOFFINGER: Let's take a look at the next
24 email in the chain.

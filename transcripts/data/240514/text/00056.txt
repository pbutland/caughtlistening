5            Did you ask Mr. Davidson to have Ms. Daniels appear on
6   the Hannity Show, the Sean Hannity Show on Fox during this
7   time?
8       A    I did.
9       Q    Why did you do that?
10       A    Because I wanted to continue to promote the statement
11   that there was no relationship and that Trump had no
12   involvement.

21   is flying to L.A. tomorrow.  I'm trying to get her to commit
22   for tomorrow.

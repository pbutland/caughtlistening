1       A    Extremely.
2                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we show People's Exhibit
3       407-F, please, in evidence?
4                 Can we blow up the top tweet?
5                      (Displayed.)
6       Q    And I am going to ask Mr. Cohen to read them.
7            First of all, were you aware of these three tweets
8   made by President Trump at that time on April 21st of 2018.
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    And can you read those, please, to the jury?
11       A    This is from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed.
12            The New York Times and a third rate reporter named
13   Maggie Haberman, known as a Crocked H flunkey, who I don't
14   speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their
15   way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in
16   the hope that he will flip.
17            They use nonexistent sources and a drunk/drugged up
18   loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family.
19            Michael is a businessman for his own account slash
20   lawyer who I have always liked and respected.  Most people will
21   flip if the Government let's them out of trouble.  Even if it
22   means lying or making up stories.
23            Sorry, I don't know -- I don't see Michael doing that
24   despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media.
25       Q    Who did you understand, at the time, that Mr. Trump

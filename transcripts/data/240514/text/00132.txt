1 Q Are you ——
2 A No, I’m not.
3 I have constantly maintained that I do not dispute the fact
4 there was an error in the taxable amount and the tax that was
5 due.
6 What I did dispute, and I continue to dispute, is that for
7 a first—time offender, who has consistently paid taxes on its
8 due date and never having been, um, audited, that this would go
9 immediately to a criminal charge.
10 From the day that we found out, I was given 48 hours within
11 which to plead guilty or the Southern District of New York was
12 going to file an 80—page indictment that included my wife.
13 Q Is that because your wife had also signed those
14 documents?
15 A That's correct.
16 Q With respect to the charge of false statements to a
17 bank, are you disputing the underlying facts of that charge?
18 A No.
19 Q What is it that you're disputing with respect to that
20 charge?
21 A That the —— that there was materiality in the, um,
22 statement that they say was inaccurate or missing.
23 I had the HELOC, again, which I think I explained.
24 Q Go on.
25 A The home equity line of credit.

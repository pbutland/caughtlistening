M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3664
1       A    I -- I cannot agree with that, no, sir.
2       Q    You -- so let me ask you this, are you the one that
3   leaked to CNN that you had given your phones to the District
4   Attorney earlier in January of 2023?
5       A    I don't recall.
6       Q    So you don't recall whether -- when you talked about it
7   with Mr. Lemon, whether they already -- whether CNN already had
8   that information or whether you gave it to them; you don't
9   recall either way?
10       A    I don't.
11       Q    So take a look at B57 just again for Mr. Cohen, the
12   Court and the parties.
13                (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.)
14       Q    And this is a text message with the District Attorney's
15   Office and your lawyer, again, again, you are not on these text
16   messages, sir.
17                 (Witness reading.)
18       Q    Does that refresh your recollection that you said that
19   CNN already had the info on the phones and all you did was
20   confirm?
21       A    No, sir.  I don't recall.
22       Q    If it was leaked to CNN and not by you, who else knew
23   that the phones had been given to the District Attorney's
24   Office?
25                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.

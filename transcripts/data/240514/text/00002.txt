Proceedings
3505
1 First of all, we had indicated that, potentially,
2 that we would call another witness, that was going to be
3 another book publisher, but we’ve decided that we really
4 don’t need to do that.
5 So, Mr. Cohen will be the last witness.
6 Related to that, I don’t know how long
7 Mr. Blanche’s cross—examination will be, but I think that
8 it's highly likely that we will get to the defense case,
9 such as it is, on Thursday.
10 And we don’t know who the defense witnesses are,
11 except for an expert witness and potentially Mr. Trump.
12 They've indicated that the only other witnesses
13 that they intend to call are impeachment witnesses.
14 Under 245.20 (4)(b), we are entitled to know that
15 at the end of whatever witness’ testimony they are seeking
16 to impeach.
17 So I understand that we haven’t gotten there yet
18 with Michael Cohen, but if there are any other impeachment
19 witnesses that they intend to call to impeach one or other
20 of our witnesses, we would like to know who those witnesses
21 are.
22 I think we’re entitled to know who they are.
23 Also, for planning purposes, we are entitled to
24 have our potential rebuttal expert present for any expert
25 testimony that they may proffer on their case.

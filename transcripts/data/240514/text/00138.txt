1       Q    As a result of your felony pleas?
2       A    Yes, ma'am.
3       Q    How many years, in total, did you practice law before
4   you were disbarred?
5       A    Thirty.
6       Q    Over the years while you were practicing law, you said
7   you had some businesses; is that right?
8       A    That's correct.
9       Q    Do you still have the taxi medallion business that you
10   testified about?
11       A    No, ma'am.
12       Q    And do you still -- just briefly, did you sell off
13   those businesses, the taxi medallion business?
14       A    Two separate times.
15       2002, I sold a management company which I had 15 percent
16   interest to my ex partner, but I retained the medallions as an
17   asset.
18       As a result of the felony conviction, felons are not
19   allowed to own New York City taxi medallions, so I had to sell
20   those.
21       The same holds true to the taxi medallions I owned in
22   Chicago.
23       Q    You mentioned you previously owned some real estate.
24       Have you sold much of that?
25       A    Yes, ma'am.

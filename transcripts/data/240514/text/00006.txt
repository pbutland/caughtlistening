Proceedings
3509
1 Those are two exhibits, one which is Mr. Cohen’s
2 attorney’s letter in response to an FEC complaint and
3 Mr. Cohen's public statement in response to an FEC
4 complaint.
5 And they’ve asked for a limiting instruction, I
6 guess, along the lines of the prior instruction that your
7 Honor gave.
8 We do have a draft of that instruction.
9 It’s not going to come up just yet, but a little
10 bit later today, but we thought it made sense to perhaps go
11 over it now.
12 THE COURT: Have you had a chance to review it?
13 MS. HOFFINGER: No. I just gave it to defense.
14 THE COURT: Okay.
15 MR. BLANCHE: I need to do look it.
16 THE COURT: Once you look at it, and if you agree,
17 to please let me know and also let me know when you want me
18 to give it.
19 MR. BLANCHE: Also, your Honor, assuming that
20 Mr. Cohen testifies this morning around his guilty plea for
21 FECA, we would ask your Honor to give that limiting
22 instruction.
23 And I think we have a copy of it.
24 THE COURT: No, I have a copy of it.
25 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you.

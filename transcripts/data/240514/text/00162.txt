1                THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       A    Or, clearly, Lanny Davis.  It could be others.  I don't
3   know.
4       Q    Well, does Mr. Rosenberg know?
5       A    Yes, Mr. Rosenberg would know.
6       Q    He picked them up; correct?
7       A    He did.
8       Q    And other members of the District Attorney's Office
9   necessarily knew; correct?  Right?
10       A    Correct.
11       Q    But you don't know, as you sit here today, you're not
12   sure whether you leaked that or somebody else leaked that?
13       A    That's what I stated, yes.
14       Q    And then, again, still talking about last year on
15   March 19th, 2023 -- which, by the way, you testified in the
16   Grand Jury on March 13th; correct?
17       A    I believe so, yes.
18       Q    So March 19th, six days later, you recall that once
19   again, your -- the District Attorney's Office was frustrated and
20   upset that you were continuing to talk on TV; correct?
21       A    No, sir.  I don't recall that either.
22       Q    And you actually promised at that point, that you would
23   stop going on TV, you would do no more appearances on TV until
24   after the indictment; correct?
25       A    Again, I don't recall that.

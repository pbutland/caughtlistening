1 Q. President Trump's personal counsel?
2 A. Yes, ma'am.
3 Q. Now, let me direct your attention to December 12, 2018.
4 As a result of pleading guilty to the federal crimes that you've
5 just described, your pleading guilty in August of 2018 and also
6 November of 2018, were you sentenced by a Court in the Southern
7 District of New York?
8 A. I was.
9 Q. And what was the sentence that you received from the
10 court as a result of pleading guilty to those crimes?
11 A. 36 months incarceration followed by 36 months of
12 supervised release.
13 Q. And were you also required to pay fines and some
14 restitution?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Explain that to the jury, please?
17 A. So the restitution stemmed from the amount of tax that
18 was not paid over the years from 2012 through 2016. And that
19 tax bill amount was $1,394,000.
20 Q. And did you pay those taxes back to the IRS?
21 A. I did, before even sentencing, when I finally found out
22 from the Southern District of New York what the actual amount
23 was.
24 Q. After, were you also assessed some fines by the Court?
25 A. Yes, ma'am.

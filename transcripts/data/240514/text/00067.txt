M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3570
1   The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign
2   contribution or campaign expenditure by anyone.
3            Was that a false statement?
4       A    It was my drawing a legal conclusion, which is
5   inaccurate.
6       Q    Now, can you read the second to last line in -- thank
7   you -- in the next paragraph.
8            Can you read that to us, please?
9       A    I do not plan to provide any further comment on the
10   FEC matter or regarding Ms. Clifford.
11       Q    And why did you write that?
12       A    Because I realized that once you send this to the
13   press, that they are smarter than just to notice The Trump
14   Organization or the Trump campaign.  That they would ask
15   additional questions such as:  Well, did it come from
16   Mr. Trump?
17            Did it come from somebody else?
18            And I wanted to just preface it to them:  This is the
19   statement you are going to get from me to run with and that I
20   have no intentions to continue to comment on the matter.
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we also just blow up the last
22       line in the letter.
23                      (Displayed.)
24       Q    And would you read that to the jury?
25       A    Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it

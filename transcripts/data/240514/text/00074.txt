1       A    I told him that the matter is going to be taken care
2   of and the person, of course, who is going to be able to do it
3   is Jeff Sessions.
4       Q    Who was Jeff Sessions at the time?
5       A    The Attorney General.
6       Q    Why did you tell him that?
7       A    Because that was post my conversation with the
8   President.
9       Q    And when you say, post, had you previously been told
10   that by President Trump?
11       A    Yes, ma'am.
12       Q    Now, I know you mentioned previously the work that you
13   did on the Temporary Restraining Order related to Stormy
14   Daniels.
15            Do you remember that testimony?
16       A    Yes, ma'am.
17       Q    Did there come a time when, as a result of some of the
18   public statements you were making about your being the only one
19   involved in the payment, and the fact that -- withdrawn.  That
20   is a long sentence -- a long question.
21            Did there come a time around this time period that you
22   made certain statements to news reporting, indicating that only
23   you had made the payment and that, in fact, no sexual encounter
24   had occurred?
25       A    Yes.

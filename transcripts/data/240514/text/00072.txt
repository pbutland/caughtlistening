1       for one minute?
2                 THE COURT:  Sure.
3                      (Ms. Hoffinger and Mr. Blanche confer.)
4                 MR. BLANCHE:  May we briefly approach, your
5       Honor?
6                 THE COURT:  Yes.
7                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
8                 record.)
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am not trying to disrupt the
10       flow.  I would ask for a limiting instruction about what we

12                 I wouldn't ask you to restate the full
13       instruction, just that the same instruction applies to the
14       testimony regarding Mr. Pecker getting a Notice from the
15       FEC.
16                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I think we already addressed
17       that.
18                 THE COURT:  I did give an instruction.
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am not asking for the full
20       instruction, just a reminder.
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I think you gave a full
22       instruction when Mr. Pecker testified, but it's up to the
23       Court.
24                 THE COURT:  What would you like me to say?
25                 MR. BLANCHE:  Remind them, if you could, that you

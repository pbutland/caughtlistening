M. Cohen — Direct/Hoffinger
3583
1 FBI, raided my apartment that was under construction, my law
2 office and TD Bank, which had a safety deposit box that I had
3 just opened in order to put valuables in because I didn’t want
4 to keep them in the hotel or, obviously, in the apartment. It
5 was under repair.
6 Q And did the FBI search those locations for items of
7 yours?
8 A They did.
9 Q And what kind of things did they seize from you when
10 they executed that search warrant at your hotel room?
11 A The search warrant gave them the right to take my two
12 cell phones, to take any and all electronic devices, as well as
13 records.
14 They took my two cell phones and a series of my tax
15 books, as well as other documents. I, ultimately, found out
16 that they also, basically, packed up much of the documentation
17 that was in my law office and took that as well.
18 Q Now, you mentioned two cell phones that they took.
19 Were those the two cell phones associated with the
20 numbers ending 0114 containing the phone, the audio recording
21 with Donald Trump that we heard previously, which is People’s
22 Exhibit 246?
23 A Yes, ma’am.
24 Q So that was one of the phones that they seized, is
25 that right?

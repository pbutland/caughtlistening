1       Q    Putting aside -- you would also help some of the kids
2   with various work, maybe not legal work and filing lawsuits,
3   but, for example, reaching out to the media on behalf of
4   President Trump's children; correct?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6       Q    And you were paid -- just focusing now on 2011 to
7   2016, you made about 375,000 a year in base salary; right?
8       A    That's correct.
9       Q    With the exception of 2016, your bonus for those
10   years, 2011 to 2015, was 150,000 a year; right?
11       A    Correct.
12       Q    That's what you would get in a check around the
13   holiday season, around Christmastime; correct?
14       A    Correct.
15       Q    Now, fair to say that you admired President Trump
16   while you were working for him?
17       A    Yes, sir.
18       Q    You admired his financial success, his high profile,
19   his tenacity?
20       A    Very much so, yes.
21       Q    You've read Art of the Deal, I believe, twice; is that
22   correct?
23       A    That's correct.
24       Q    And you view that as a masterpiece; correct?
25       A    I viewed it as a excellent book, yes.

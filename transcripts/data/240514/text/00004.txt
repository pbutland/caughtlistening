Proceedings
3507
I back and read the CPL, I believe the pre—charge conference,
2 while it comes before summation ——
3 MR. BLANCHE: Yes.
4 THE COURT: —— I think normally it comes at the end
5 of the case.
6 So you are kind of basing your evidence on what I
7 decide as far as charges, and we may not know a final
8 decision until we have the pre—charge conference.
9 MR. BLANCHE: Well, maybe I should rephrase.
10 We —— if we can have an opportunity to argue or
ll discuss what we anticipate our expert will testify to, get a
12 ruling from the Court, your Honor already ruled, but there
13 was some —— we believe, given where we are now, we at least
14 need to address it again.
15 So maybe it's not a charge conference.
16 THE COURT: Fine. We can do that.
17 MR. BLANCHE: My point is, I think they're
18 travelling over the weekend.
19 And as far as their expert, I don't believe that we
20 would have him take the stand before Monday.
21 THE COURT: And do you have any indication whether
22 your client is going to testify?
23 MR. BLANCHE: No.
24 THE COURT: No determination yet?
25 MR. BLANCHE: No.

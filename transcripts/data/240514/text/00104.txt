5       Q.   Does that refresh your recollection about what the
6   YouTube video was about?
7       A.   Yes, ma'am.
8       Q.   What was it about, in general?
9       A.   It was Rudy Giuliani in a TV appearance talking about

11       Q.   And what did you respond to him?
12       A.   Why send this to me?

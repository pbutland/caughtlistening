2       Q    And can you read what's in the description box?
3       A    It states:  "Retainer, 12/1 through 12/31/2017."
4       Q    And was this check paid to you, in truth, as a retainer
5   for covering the month of December, 2017?
6       A    No, ma'am.
7       Q    So is the description on the check stub false?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    Was this the last check that you received from
10   Mr. Trump or anyone at The Trump Organization?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Why was that?
13       A    Again, it was because the full reimbursement of the
14   $420,000 had been paid.
15       Q    Thank you.
16                MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down.
17                Can we now pull up People's Exhibit 42 in evidence.
18                (Displayed.)
19                MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we scroll down just a little
20       bit so that Mr. Cohen can recognize this exhibit.

22       Q    Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review the 11
23   checks that are contained in here, in this exhibit totaling
24   $420,000?
25       A    I have.

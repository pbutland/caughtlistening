3                 THE COURT:  Counsel, please approach.
4                 (Whereupon, there was an off-the-record discussion
5        held at the bench between the Court and counsel.)
6                 THE COURT:  Let's just put on the record what we
7        were discussing at the bench.
8                 I was asking Mr. Blanche if at that point he still
9        thought it would be possible he would be finished with the
10        witness by Thursday afternoon.
11                 You were answering the question.
12                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, if I finish, it's at the end of
13        the day, I anticipate, your Honor.
14                 THE COURT:  Again, there is no rush.  Take your
15        time.  Do whatever you need to do.
16                 You are also covering a different topic?
17                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, your Honor.
18                 As it relates to our expert witness, we put in a
19        proposed charge today.
20                 The Government put their's in yesterday, your
21        Honor.
22                 What we would respectfully request, that we have
23        an opportunity to discuss the testimony to make sure that
24        our understanding of what is admissible is consistent with
25        the Court's motions in limine.

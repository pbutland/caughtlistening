1       Q    And does that invoice falsely state that you are
2   seeking payment for services rendered during the month of

8       Q    Did you receive this check and an attached stub in
9   response to the false invoice that we just showed the jury,
10   which was 37I?
11       A    I did.
12       Q    And do you see whose signature is on the check?
13       A    I do.
14       Q    Whose is it?
15       A    Donald J. Trump.

19       Q    Could you read, please, for the jury what's in the
20   description box?
21       A    Yes.  It states:  "Retainer.  October 1st through
22   10/31/2017."
23       Q    Was this -- in truth, was this check paid to you as a
24   retainer for that month?
25       A    No, ma'am.

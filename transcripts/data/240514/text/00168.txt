M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3671
1       Q    You do that Podcast twice a week; is that right?
2       A    Each Podcast is done twice a week.
3       Q    So that's four Podcasts a week?
4       A    Correct.
5       Q    And is that -- I mean, is that all year long or are
6   there breaks?
7       A    All year long.
8       Q    So that's about, how many a month?  About 15 to 20 a
9   month depending?  Do you always do two a week?
10       A    Uh-huh; correct.
11       Q    So it's fair to say that you have done hundreds of
12   Podcast episodes during the investigation and during the
13   charges -- since the case has been charged; correct?
14       A    I don't know about hundreds, but, yes, the math is the
15   math.
16       Q    Well, we can do the math?
17       A    Okay.
18       Q    I mean, if there's 16 a month?
19       A    Right.
20       Q    Ten months is 160; right?
21       A    Then it would be 160.
22       Q    So -- and this investigation didn't just start a year
23   ago; did it?
24       A    No, it did not.
25       Q    So when I say hundreds, it's more than 200; correct?

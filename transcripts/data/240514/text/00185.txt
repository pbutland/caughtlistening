1       But, your obsession for -- you admired him even before you
2   started working for him; correct?
3       A    That's correct.
4       Q    And you spoke publicly on many occasions about your
5   positive feelings for President Trump; correct?
6       A    Yes, sir.
7       Q    You've said -- just for some examples, in 2015, you
8   publicly said he was a good man?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    Also in 2015, this is around the time he announced he
11   was running for President, you said that he's a man who cares
12   deeply about this country; right?
13       A    I said that.
14       Q    That he's a man who tells it straight?
15       A    Yes, sir.
16       Q    Now, you also said -- again, I'm still in 2015 --
17   that, in your view, President Trump speaks from the heart?
18       A    I've said that.
19       Q    And that all that he wants to do is make this country
20   great again.
21       You said that?
22       A    Sounds right, yes.
23       Q    And at the time, you weren't lying; right?
24       A    At that time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald
25   Trump; yes.

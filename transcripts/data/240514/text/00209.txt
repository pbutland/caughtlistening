14        scheduling for one moment before we continue.
15                 As you know, we're not meeting tomorrow because
16        it's Wednesday.
17                 I also remind you, we're not going to be meeting
18        this Friday.
19                 The last thing is, I'm told one of your fellow
20        jurors has a commitment Thursday afternoon, so we're only
21        going to work until 4 o'clock on Thursday.
22                 You may proceed.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you, your Honor.

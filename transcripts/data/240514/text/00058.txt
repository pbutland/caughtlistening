4       Q    Did Ms. Daniels end up going on the Sean Hannity Show?
5       A    No, ma'am.
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we now put up People's 278 in
7       evidence, please?
8                      (Displayed.)
9       Q    Now, later in the month of January, January 30th of
10   2018, did you make more efforts to get Keith Davidson to have
11   Stormy Daniels issue another denial statement?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    Why did you do that?
14       A    Because despite what we thought was dying, the story
15   dying, there were still persistent reporters that were looking
16   into this.  And I felt an official statement from her, another
17   one, would be helpful to putting an end to it.
18       Q    Do you also recall that around that same time there
19   was some news that she might go on the Jimmy Kimmel Show?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    And so, did you pressure Keith Davidson to have her
22   sign this statement?
23       A    I did.
24       Q    In fact, did he provide that statement to you from
25   Stormy Daniels?

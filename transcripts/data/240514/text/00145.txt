M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3648
1       Q    Without telling us why.
2       A    (Nods yes.)
3       Q    Mr. Cohen, do you have any regrets about your past
4   work and your association with Donald Trump?
5       A    I do.
6       Q    What are they?
7       A    I regret doing things for him that I should not have:
8   lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal.
9       I don't regret working at the Trump Organization, 'cause,
10   as I expressed before, some very interesting, great times.
11       But, to a -- to keep the loyalty and to do the things that
12   he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass. And I
13   suffered the penalty. As has my family.
14                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Nothing further, your Honor.
15                 THE COURT:  Jurors, let's go ahead and take our
16        lunch recess at this time.
17                 I remind you of all of the admonitions,
18        including:
19                 Do not discuss this case either among yourselves
20        or anyone else.
21                 Continue to keep an open mind as to the
22        defendant's guilt or innocence.
23                 Do not express or form an opinion as to the
24        defendant's guilt or innocence.
25                 I'll see you at 2:15.

1   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
2       Q    Could you please read the first -- actually, the first
3   line in the second paragraph?
4       A    I am Mr. Trump's long-time special counsel, and I have
5   proudly served in that role for more than a decade.

13   personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to

15   Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford

19   campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.
20       Q    Now, was that statement false?

7   correct?
8       A    That's correct.
9       Q    And then just over a week later, do you recall that you
10   went on CNN and told the news anchor named Don Lemon that you
11   had been contacted by the District Attorney's Office and they
12   had asked you to provide them with your cell phones and you had
13   done so; do you remember doing that?
14       A    Sounds correct.
15       Q    And do you remember the District Attorney's Office
16   being frustrated and upset that you had done that?
17       A    No, sir.
18       Q    You don't recall that the District Attorney's Office
19   was frustrated that you went on TV to talk about the fact that
20   you had turned over your phones?
21       A    I don't recall them expressing that to me, no.
22       Q    Do you recall -- do you recall saying that you did not
23   tell Mr. Lemon or tell CNN that your phones had been seized,
24   that they already had that information and you just confirmed
25   it; correct?

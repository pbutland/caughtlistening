1   Trump's children or President Trump because of the
2   investigation?
3       A    (Pause)  I'm sorry. Where was that said?
4       Q    So, let me ask it a different way.
5       In the Fall of 2017, okay -- so, in September of 2017,
6   there was an ongoing investigation; and one of the consequences
7   of that was you were told you had to stay away and you
8   shouldn't communicate directly with President Trump or his
9   family; correct?
10       A    I was advised that I could not speak to President
11   Trump, but not to the family.
12       Q    Well, you don't remember saying to Emily Fox in the
13   reporting that: That's the part that's most disappointing,
14   meaning not being able to see the President, I haven't spoken
15   to any of the kids?
16       A    Correct.
17       Not that I couldn't see the kids. We just didn't.
18       Q    Well, you didn't speak with the kids?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    You then testified in Congress on October 24th of that
21   year; correct?
22       A    Correct.
23       Q    And this is the testimony that you talked about on
24   direct where you lied?
25       A    That's the 2017?

3            "You told me back in April that I was part of the team.
4   I've acted accordingly on your behalf."
5            "When I suggested that we meet and discuss a strategy
6   following this news, you suddenly took a new approach and
7   stated, "That's not going to happen."
8            "Stunned by this remark, I was asking you for a
9   clarification of our legal relationship.  You indicated that you
10   would be talking to someone in a boutique firm that was not
11   ready to get involved.  When I noted that you were willing to
12   sit down with them but not sit down with us, you had an
13   unfortunate outburst."
14            "I relayed the situation to Jeff Citron, who suggested
15   that you probably were just having a bad moment, but that it was
16   necessary to seek clarification of our position with you in
17   light of your remarks."
18       Q.   What was happening at the time?  What did you
19   understand this to be about?
20       A.   So, Mr. Costello, again, pressuring me, as he had done,
21   with constant calls and sending me emails and so on.  And he
22   wanted to absolutely be retained to represent me in this matter.
23            I stated to him that I was speaking with someone in a
24   boutique firm and that we were still not yet ready for the
25   engagement.

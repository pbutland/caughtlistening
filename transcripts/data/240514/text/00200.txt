M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche
3703
1 the Moscow Project, okay, that was one of many things you
2 talked about that day; right?
3 A I believe so, yes.
4 Q Do you recall lying about anything else or were you
5 only lying about that? Or being inaccurate? Whatever word.
6 A I —— I don’t know.
7 I'd have to refresh my memory to see what the document is,
8 but I specifically recall the number of times that I claimed to
9 have spoken to Mr. Trump, which I was doing for his benefit
10 and, in essence, at his direction.
11 Q But, ultimately —— but, ultimately, what the Special
12 Counsel made you plead guilty to from your lies to Congress,
13 right, had to do only with the Moscow Project; correct?
14 A That’s correct.
15 Q And you never had to plead guilty to a false
16 statements charge from when you lied in this meeting on
17 August 7th; did you?
18 A No, sir.
19 Q Now, did they also —— you were also asked on that
20 date, on August 7, 2018, about the Access Hollywood videotape
21 and audiotape; weren’t you?
22 A I believe so.
23 Q And you —— you testified that you —— excuse me.
24 You told them on August 7th that you were in London; right?
25 A I was.

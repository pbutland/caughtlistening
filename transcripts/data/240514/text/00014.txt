3                   (Displayed.)
4       A    From me to Jeff.  Again, Tuesday, February 14th,
5   regarding the two dollar signs.
6       "Jeff, please remind me of the monthly amount?"
7       Q    At that point, had you -- did you not have -- why were
8   you asking for the monthly amount?
9       A    I actually didn't remember it.  I didn't have a copy of
10   the document that I had worked on with Allen Weisselberg and
11   then presented to Mr. Trump.
12       Q    If you had a Retainer Agreement, would it have had a
13   monthly amount in it?
14       A    Yes, ma'am.
15       Q    But there was no Retainer Agreement?
16       A    No, ma'am.
17                MS. HOFFINGER:  Can we put up Mr. McConney's
18       response for Mr. Cohen.

20       A    From Jeff McConney to me.  In response:  "35,000 per
21   month."
22       Q    Thank you.
23                MS. HOFFINGER:  Now, can we show Page 2.

1       Q    Were all 11 checks received by you and deposited and
2   the amounts reflected in the checks paid out to you?
3       A    Yes, ma'am.
4                MS. HOFFINGER:  We can take that down.  Thank you
5       very much.
6       Q    Now, after the last check was sent to you in December
7   of 2017, I think you mentioned, you never received any other
8   checks from Mr. Trump or from his Trust; is that right?
9       A    That's correct.
10       Q    Or from The Trump Organization?
11       A    Also correct.
12       Q    I want to talk to you a little bit about the work that
13   you did in 2017, any work that you did with respect to your role
14   as Personal Attorney and Personal Counsel to President Trump.
15   Did you do, in the year 2017, any work for Mr. Trump or for his
16   wife Melania Trump?
17       A    Minimal.
18       Q    And can you just give us some examples of the minimal
19   work that you did in 2017 for them?
20       A    There was a matter that dealt with an individual by the
21   name of Summer Zervos.
22       I was working with Marc Kasowitz on that, and so I had
23   spoken with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and provided him some
24   documents that Mr. Kasowitz had given to me to pass along.
25       As far as Melania, I think it had to do with some trademarks

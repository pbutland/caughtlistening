M. Cohen - Direct/Hoffinger
3564
1       A    In a private transaction in 2016 before the United
2   States Presidential Election, Mr. Cohen used his own personal
3   funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie
4   Clifford.  Neither The Trump Organization, nor the Trump
5   campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and
6   neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment directly or
7   indirectly.
8       Q    Was that statement false or misleading?
9       A    Misleading.
10       Q    And can you explain to the jury why it is misleading?
11       A    So, while crafting the statement, we elected to state
12   neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a
13   party to the transaction.  That is a true statement, but it's
14   deceptive.  It's misleading.
15       Q    Can you explain why it's misleading?
16       A    Well, because it was neither The Trump Org., or the
17   Trump campaign.  It was the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust or
18   Mr. Trump himself.
19       Q    And you omitted that in the letter?
20       A    I omitted it.
21       Q    And did you intend for it to be misleading?
22       A    Yes, ma'am.
23       Q    Why?
24       A    In order to protect Mr. Trump.  To stay on message.
25   To demonstrate my continued loyalty.

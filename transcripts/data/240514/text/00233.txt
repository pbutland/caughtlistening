1       Q.   But, just so I understand, I am talking about 2021, do
2   you believe you were going on TV in 2021?
3       A.   Yes.
4       Q.   And then in November of 2021, your sentence is over and
5   then you're on supervised release; correct?
6       A.   Correct.
7       Q.   Can you explain what fundamentally changed when your
8   sentence ends, given the uniqueness of the Corona Virus, when
9   your sentence ends and you convert to supervised release?
10       A.   With the home confinement for those appearances on
11   television or to meet with the District Attorney's Office or
12   anything outside of the three hours that I was provided access,
13   you fill out a form to your probation officer, and you wait for
14   approval.
15            Supervised release is less stringent.  Basically, you
16   check in once a month on a form.  And if you're going to leave
17   the state or the country, you just still have to provide them
18   with notice via an authorization form.
19       Q.   And that the second part of what you are just talking
20   about, that started around November of that year; right?
21       A.   That started when I was returning home.
22       Q.   And you're still on supervised release until November
23   of this year; correct?
24       A.   Correct.
25       Q.   You understood at some point during this investigative

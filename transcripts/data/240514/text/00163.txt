1                MR. BLANCHE:  Well, can we take a look at B58.
2       Again, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.
3                (Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.)
4       Q    And this, again, sir, you are not on this text, this is
5   with the District Attorney's Office and your lawyer.
6                 (Witness reading.)
7       Q    Does that refresh your recollection that you promised
8   that you would make no more appearances on TV until after the
9   indictment?
10       A    No, sir.
11       Q    So, just so I understand, you testified yesterday about
12   very specific recollections that you have about telephone calls,
13   for example, with President Trump in 2016, but you have no
14   recollection of whether last March -- so just over a year ago,
15   you promised the District Attorney that you would stop going on
16   TV; that's your testimony?
17       A    What I'm saying to you, sir, is that I don't recall
18   even having this conversation with Lanny Davis about not going
19   on television.
20       Q    So you don't recall a year ago, making a promise that
21   you would no longer go on TV until after the indictment?
22       A    No, sir.
23       Q    But you recall very specifically multiple telephone
24   conversations that you had with President Trump in 2016;
25   correct?

1   screen to the prior email that we saw from Mr. McConney
2   reminding you to send the invoices that you had spoken to Allen
3   about?
4       A    Yes, ma'am.
5       Q    And would you read that for the jury and just the date
6   and who it's from and to?
7       A    So this is from me to Jeff McConney, on February 14th,
8   of 2017, regarding two dollar signs.
9       "Jeff, sorry for the delay, and thank you for the reminder.
10   Please have the monthly checks for January and February made
11   payable to Michael D. Cohen, Esquire and sent to.....  hope you
12   are well and see you soon."
13       Q    And you didn't reference invoices here, just that they
14   should send you the checks?
15       A    Correct.
16       Q    Why is that?
17       A    Because there was no need.  There was no invoice.

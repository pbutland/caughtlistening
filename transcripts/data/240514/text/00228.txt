M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3731
1   Manhattan, but it wasn't about this case; correct?
2       A.   Sounds correct.
3       Q.   And you didn't -- so, you said a few minutes ago that
4   the District Attorney hadn't asked you to come and meet with
5   them in that timeframe; right?  Meaning, between 2019 and 2021,
6   you hadn't been asked to meet with the District Attorney; right?
7       A.   That's correct.
8       Q.   If they had asked, you would have cooperated and come
9   in; correct?
10       A.   Presumably so.
11       Q.   And you wanted, during that time period -- and you were
12   asked this on direct a little bit, but I want to talk about it a
13   little bit more again.  In the 2021 time period, early part, you
14   wanted the District Attorney's Office to publicly acknowledge
15   that you were cooperating; correct?
16       A.   I would say so, yes.
17       Q.   Well, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
18           Would you say so?  Do you have any doubt that you wanted
19   that?
20       A.   No.
21       Q.   And you're still serving your sentence at home; is that
22   right?
23       A.   I am still on supervised release.
24       Q.   But your 2021 sentence is over?
25       A.   November.

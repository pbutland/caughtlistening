1   period for those conversations.
2       Q    What, essentially, did you communicate to Congress in
3   terms of the time period?
4       A    I told them that it was a truncated time period and
5   that I had only spoken to Mr. Trump about this project three
6   times.
7       Q    And, in truth, how many times had you?
8       A    Ten times.
9       Q    And did you also communicate to them that it was --
10   that those communications stopped at an earlier date than they
11   actually did?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    Why did you make those false statements to Congress?
14       A    Because I was staying on Mr. Trump's message that there
15   was no Russia-Russia-Russia and, again, in coordination with the
16   Joint Defense Team, that's what was preferred.
17       Q    Now, let me direct your attention to the early months
18   of 2018.
19       Did you continue to lie about Mr. Trump's involvement in the
20   Stormy Daniels payoff?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And did you continue to pressure other people, for
23   example, like Keith Davidson, to lie about the payoffs to Karen
24   McDougal and to Stormy Daniels?
25       A    Yes.

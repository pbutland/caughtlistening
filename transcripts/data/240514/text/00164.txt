1       A    I recall the conversations with President Trump at the
2   time, yes.
3       Q    Do you recall a telephone call last year in March
4   before the indictment with you, your lawyer and the District
5   Attorney's Office where they emphasized how important it was for
6   you to stop talking to the -- to the TV and stop going on TV?
7       A    No, sir.  I do not recall that either.  Because I don't
8   recall ever agreeing not to go on television.
9       Q    You don't recall the District Attorney telling you that
10   you were unwittingly helping President Trump by going on TV?
11       A    No, sir.
12       Q    Now, you talked a little bit about Mr. Costello
13   earlier today, the attorney that you were speaking with after
14   you were raided by the FBI in about June of that year; correct?
15       A    That's correct.
16       Q    And you remember last year in March during the Grand
17   Jury phase of this case, you were called down as a possible
18   rebuttal witness for Mr. Costello; correct?
19       A    I believe so, yes.
20       Q    Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that you were
21   called down to the District Attorney's Office on March 20th as a
22   possible rebuttal witness?
23       A    Yes, sir, I remember.
24       Q    You were?
25       A    I do, yes.

1   can't cause you harm or damage.  I will always protect
2   Mr. Trump.
3       Q    And why did you write that?
4       A    Because it was a statement that validated what was in
5   the second paragraph about me providing my own personal funds
6   to facilitate the payment.
7            And the last line:  I will always protect Mr. Trump,
8   was to validate that specific line.
9                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.
10                 You can take that down.
11       Q    Now, around that same time that you released that
12   statement -- that you were going to be releasing that statement
13   to the press publicly, did you also provide that statement to
14   someone named Jay Sekulow?
15       A    I did.
16       Q    Who was Jay Sekulow at the time?
17       A    He was representing Mr. Trump.
18       Q    And is he an attorney?
19       A    He is.
20       Q    And explain why you sent that public statement that
21   you were going to send out to Mr. Sekulow?
22       A    I was referred to Mr. Sekulow, actually, by Sean
23   Hannity to speak about this FEC Complaint.  And I was
24   instructed to by Mr. Trump, to keep in touch with Jay Sekulow
25   because he was in contact with Mr. Trump.

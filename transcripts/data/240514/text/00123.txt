1   mine who happens to be a lawyer, Jeffrey K. Levine, to come
2   with me because something just seems wrong.

20   publicly and writing publicly?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Did you agree to sign that Agreement at that time?
23       A    I asked them if we could tamp down the language, as I
24   had been working on a book --
25                 MR. BLANCHE:  Objection.

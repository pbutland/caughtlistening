1       A    Okay.
2       Q    I asked whether you said, "No," under oath to Judge
3   Pauley, that nobody had threatened or induced you to plead
4   guilty?
5       A    Correct.
6       Q    That was a lie?
7       A    That was not true; correct.
8       Q    Can we get through this.
9       What's the difference between a lie and something that's
10   not true?
11                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
12                THE COURT:  Sustained.
13       Q    You said "it's not true."
14       What is the difference, in your mind, between something that
15   is not true and a lie?
16       A    I said that's correct.  I was using just a different
17   terminology.
18       Q    Okay.  So you -- so it was a lie?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    Now, after you pled guilty in August, one of the things
21   that happens is that you meet with a member of the Court staff
22   and they draft what's called a Presentence Investigation Report;
23   right?
24       A    Correct.
25       Q    And you did that in the Federal case that we're talking

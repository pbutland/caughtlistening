M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3855
1       Q    So you are saying that was early on, right after you
2   plead guilty like in August?
3       A    If I plead guilty, yes.  The concept came up, and I
4   wasn't interested, and I said don't even bring it up.
5       Q    And the concept you are talking about is the

7       A    The 5K1.
8       Q    But you get a 5K1 if you sign a Cooperation Agreement?
9       A    Which I did not.
10       Q    Which was never offered to you, correct?

14            Let's talk about your desire to work at the White
15   House.

18   working with President Trump in the White House, correct?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    And I believe you testified that you were never
21   offered the role of Chief of Staff, and while you agreed that
22   that role maybe wasn't right for you, you wish you would have
23   been, at least, considered, is that right?
24       A    I would have liked to be considered for ego purposes.
25       Q    You also testified that you were offered the role of

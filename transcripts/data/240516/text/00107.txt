1 Assistant General Counsel at some point, correct?
2 A That’s correct.
3 Q That could have been —— you would have been a White
4 House employee in the White House General Counsel’s Office,
5 right?
6 A That’s correct.
7 Q Now, as part of your sentencing in December, the
8 Southern District of New York wrote in their sentencing ——
9 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
10 THE COURT: Sustained.
11 Q Do you recall —— do you recall arguments being made at
12 sentencing that you had wanted a role in the White House?
13 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
14 THE COURT: Please approach.
15 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
16 record.)
17 THE COURT: When you say, arguments being made,
18 what are you referring to?
19 MR. BLANCHE: So, the Southern District in their
20 sentencing submission said that there were text messages.
21 The reason why I am laying that foundation is because he
22 then testifies about that in front of Congress.
23 So, Congress says —— at Congress he is asked a
24 question, Southern District said you wanted a job in the
25 White House?

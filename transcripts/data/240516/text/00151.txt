1                 MR. BLANCHE:  Just briefly, we have a curative
2        instruction drafted by the People regarding the unsealing
3        of the existence of the indictment.
4                 My intention was to rehabilitate the questions
5        right out of the box after lunch.
6                 If you want to take a look at that.
7                 THE COURT:  Let me take a look at it.
8                 So let's see how it goes with you.
9                 If it looks like it needs to be cleaned up some
10        more, I will read the instructions.
11                 MR. STEINGLASSS:  Very respectfully, the only
12        relevance of this entire line of questioning was to suggest
13        there was an improper leak of evidence.  They use the word
14        "leak."  You sustained it.  They used it once without being
15        sustained and once with being sustained; some kind of
16        improper leak.
17                 Two, that Michael Cohen or Jeremy Rosenberg or
18        both engaged in this conduct.  There is no other reason to
19        ask those questions.
20                 And, respectfully, this is not something that
21        should be cleaned up by the person who asks the questions
22        or on redirect.  This should be cured by the Court.
23                 The Court has given numerous limiting instructions
24        in realtime at the defendant's request.  You made this
25        application at the morning break.  It still hasn't been

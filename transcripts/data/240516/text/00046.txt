1 put in a sentencing memo; correct?
2 A Correct.
3 Q And you spoke to the Judge?
4 A I did.
5 Q And you said that you were accepting responsibility for
6 those lies, for lying to Congress; right?
7 A Correct.
8 Q But, in fact, you repeatedly said, and you even said
9 this morning and early this week, that the reason why you lied
10 was because of your loyalty to President Trump; correct?
11 A I worked with the Joint Defense Agreement, and we
12 crafted this document, that two—page document, in order to say
13 one message, the message that we all knew Mr. Trump wanted;
14 including with Mr. Trump's attorney at the time.
15 Q So, are you saying you are accepting responsibility or
16 are you blaming the Joint Defense Committee?
17 A Accepting responsibility. I read it and I submitted it
18 to the Committee.
19 Q And so, you talked about what you just described,
20 right, the fact that there was a Joint Defense Agreement and
21 other lawyers participating in drafting that letter and you talk
22 about that a lot; right?
23 A I do.
24 Q You talk about that in your book?
25 A Yes.

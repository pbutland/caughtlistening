1       Q    A day?
2       A    Sure.
3       Q    Well, that's -- let's just say 50 a day.
4       A    Okay.
5       Q    So, that means that you are getting around 350 a week,
6   is that right?
7            I know you are estimating.
8       A    Yes, sir.
9       Q    That's around 1400 a month, right?
10       A    Yes, sir.
11       Q    So, we are talking about, conservatively, 14,000 calls
12   a year in 2017 -- 2016 to 2017?
13       A    Yes, sir.
14       Q    And the same would be true, basically, 2018, and then
15   until you went to prison for 13 months, that number is about
16   right?
17       A    Yes, sir.
18       Q    So -- and I know we are just estimating, we are
19   talking about more than 50,000 phone calls between 2016 and
20   today, would you agree with that?
21       A    Yes, sir.
22       Q    And so, when you testified on Monday and Tuesday,
23   about specific conversations that you had with different folks,
24   Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard and President Trump, you were not
25   testifying from a specific recollection of that phone call,

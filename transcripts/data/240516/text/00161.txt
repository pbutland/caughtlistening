1 take the opposite. If you learned that a reporter or a
2 newspaper or magazine was going to write something negative
3 about The Trump Organization or of the The Apprentice or
4 President Trump himself, what kind of steps would you take, if
5 any, to either get rid of that story or to minimize the negative
6 press?
7 A. So that's a little bit different. One of the things is
8 instead of me calling the journalist, the journalist was calling
9 me to send an email to somebody at The Trump Organization saying
10 we're writing a story about whatever the topic may be. We have
11 a deadline of say 5 p.m., so we would like for you to comment on
12 the topic.
13 What I would do then is, I would immediately go to Mr.
14 Trump's office and I would discuss that specific topic with him
15 and we would come up with a response, a way to craft a response
16 that I would then take back to the journalist.
17 Q. You did that a lot; is that fair?
18 A. That's fair.
19 Q. You had a Rolodex full of reporters, contact
20 information; is that right?
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. So you wouldn't always have to go into President
23 Trump's office to ask him how to handle the story, you often
24 just handled it on your own, depending on the story; correct?
25 A. No, sir.

1       those terms.
2                That is -- that kind of testimony from an expert is
3       precisely the reason that there is a general and broadly
4       followed prohibition on testimony by an expert witness on
5       legal matters.
6                And, your Honor, I think there are two compounding
7       problems here.
8                One is that, as Mr. Bove noted, we have also
9       retained an expert witness who, if necessary, would be
10       prepared to testify as to the same issues.
11                But then -- and we anticipate that he would say,
12       based on what we've seen in the defendant's briefing, that
13       the way the defense is interpreting the application of those
14       statutes is inconsistent with how the Agency and how Federal
15       Courts have done the same.
16                But then we've got three people telling the jury
17       what the law is, when there should be only one.
18                It should be your Honor exclusively instructing the
19       jury on how the law applies.
20                I mean, by analogy this would be like calling an
21       expert witness to opine on whether the intent to defraud in
22       the Penal Law definition does or does not -- is or is not
23       limited to a pecuniary financial motive only.
24                That's a brief -- we have briefed it.  It's
25       identified in the charge.  Your Honor has ruled on it.  And

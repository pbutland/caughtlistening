Proceedings
3973
1 We are now making this proffer to your Honor so
2 that everybody sort of has eyes wide open coming into
3 Monday, when I think it's very possible this testimony could
4 come in, that there is a little bit of tension right now
5 between the pending request and what we would cover from ——
6 through Mr. Smith.
7 We are sensitive to that, and we don't want to have
8 him up on the stand and give the impression that we are
9 encroaching on your Honor's province.
10 THE COURT: Thank you.
11 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, I think 95 percent of
12 the proffered testimony that was just described flies
13 directly in the face of your extremely clear March 18th
14 Order, which expressly said that Mr. Smith may not testify
15 regarding the interpretation and application of Federal
16 Campaign Finance Laws.
17 You specifically held that he could identify
18 general definitions, but not interpretation or application.
19 So as to each of the three terms of art in the
20 Federal Campaign Finance Law that Mr. Bove just described,
21 "For The Purpose of Influencing," "Irrespective of the
22 Candidacy," and "Press Exemption," 1 think he just walked
23 your Honor through a very long list of Federal Case Law,
24 Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit Case Law, as well as Agency
25 Advisory Opinions and Agency Adjudications interpreting

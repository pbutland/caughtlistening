1                MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
2                THE COURT:  So going forward, please don't wait
3       until I come down to discuss these things.
4                MR. BLANCHE:  All right.
5                THE COURT:  If you want to come down in advance to
6       discuss issues like these, I can come down earlier.
7                MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.
8                THE COURT:  Just one second, before you slip away.
9       The schedule is a little bit up in the air right now.
10                And, as you know, we have some pretty large breaks
11       coming up because of graduations and travel plans and the
12       holiday, so at this moment you should plan on working next
13       Wednesday.
14                MR. BLANCHE:  We should plan on working on
15       Wednesday?
16                THE COURT:  It may not happen.
17                It could be that it won't happen, but right now you
18       should plan on that.
19                MR. BLANCHE:  So that is very much fine with us.
20                I will tell you that we have a hearing scheduled in
21       the Southern District of Florida on Wednesday.
22                Now, it's -- we are only part of a very small
23       motion and our intention was to seek permission from
24       Judge Cannon that President Trump be excused.
25                In the past, she has agreed.

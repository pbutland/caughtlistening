1   right?
2       A    Yes, they do.
3       Q    Now, you testified that there were two names used
4   Peggy Peterson and David Dennison, right, pseudonyms?
5            Those are not the real names, pseudonyms?
6       A    Yes, sir.
7       Q    Who came up with those names?
8       A    Keith Davidson did.
9       Q    Do you know why?
10       A    I believe he knew a David Dennison, and Peggy
11   Peterson, I don't know the answer.
12       Q    Now, you testified that you have, again, still
13   focusing on the legality of this contract, you testified that
14   you lied on the account opening documents with your bank and
15   called it -- said that it was going to be for consulting

17   have further questions, correct?
18       A    Or they wouldn't open up the account.
19       Q    Or they would say, no way, we are not doing it, right?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    But you agree with me that there is nothing illegal
22   about a settlement contract between two parties both of whom
23   had lawyers, right?
24       A    Correct.
25       Q    And you weren't interacting directly with Ms. Daniels,

1       Q    And you actually said on March 30th, so before the
2   indictment was unsealed, that you had Goliath on his back;
3   didn't you?
4       A    Sounds correct.
5       Q    And that same day, Detective Rosenberg complimented you
6   and said, you were so sharp and competent, saw the fantastic
7   interview on CNN just now?
8                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
9                THE COURT:  Sustained again.
10                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, may we approach?
11                THE COURT:  No.
12       Q    Do you have a recollection, Mr. Cohen, of Detective
13   Rosenberg texting you about your appearance on CNN?
14       A    Yes, sir.
15       Q    What did he tell you in that text?
16                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
17                THE COURT:  Sustained.
18       Q    Do you recall on March 31st going on TV with a reporter
19   named Joy Reid?
20       A    Yes, sir.
21       Q    And, again, this is Friday, March 31st, so it's when
22   the indictment is still under seal; correct?
23       A    Yes, sir.
24       Q    And do you recall Detective Rosenberg complimenting you
25   about your interview on Joy Reid?

Proceedings

1 THE COURT: Right.
2 There is a possibility that we will be done with
3 the presentation of evidence on Monday.
4 And if that happens, we will have our preâ€”charge
5 conference on Monday.
6 Please be prepared to begin summations on Tuesday,
7 if we do wrap it up on Monday.
8 Of course, you will see my instructions before you
9 deliver your summations.
lO I will get them to you with as much notice as I can
ll probably get them to you.
12 I will make every effort to get both summations in
13 in one day.
14 That means working early/ working late.
15 If push comes to shove, I might have to break one
16 of the summations over to the next day, which I hate to do.
17 Anything else, as far as scheduling? I am open to
18 your suggestions.
19 All right. Thank you.
20 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.
21 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.
22 (Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned
23 to Monday, May 20, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.)

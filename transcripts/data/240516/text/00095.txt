2                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, Judge.
3                 THE COURT:  Jurors, lets take our break.  I will
4       ask you during this break to please let the Sergeant know
5       if you are unable to work next Wednesday, okay.
6                 Thank you.  I will see you in about 15 minutes.

8                 following occurred:)
9                 THE COURT:  You may be seated.
10                      (Witness is excused.)
11                      (Recess is taken.)
12                 SERGEANT:  All rise.
13                 Part 59 is back in session.
14                 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, one application from
15       the People regarding the cross conducted.
16                 Mr. Blanche asked a series of questions of the
17       witness regarding disclosure of the indictment while the
18       indictment in this case was still under seal on March 31st.
19                 We are concerned that that leaves a misleading
20       impression with the jury because, as the Court knows, the
21       fact that the indictment was unsealed by Order of this
22       Court on the evening of March 30th, and there was a series
23       of questions whether the indictment was still under seal on
24       March 31st and later.
25                 So, we request that the Court takes judicial

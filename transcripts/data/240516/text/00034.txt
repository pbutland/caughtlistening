1       A    Correct; it is.
2                MR. BLANCHE:  The defense offers B25, your Honor.
3                MS. HOFFINGER:  Based on the Court's ruling, no
4       objection.
5                THE COURT:  Accepted into evidence.
6                (So marked in evidence.)
7                *********
8                MR. BLANCHE:  If we could play B25 for the jury.
9       Thank you.
10                (Audiotape so being played in open court at this
11       time.)
12                  **********
13       Q    And, now, you said that October 23rd, 2020, right, so
14   that wasn't around the time of the indictment in this case;
15   correct?
16       A    Correct.
17       Q    Now, in that same podcast, would it surprise you to
18   learn that you also said that "you are not going to lie,
19   thinking about Donald Trump and his family sitting in Otisville
20   prison makes you giddy with hope and laughter?"
21       A    Sounds correct.
22       Q    And so, in that instance, just to remind the jury,
23   Otisville is a Federal prison that you spent about a year at; is
24   that correct?
25       A    That's correct.

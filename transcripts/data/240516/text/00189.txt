M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3938
1   paid all cash.
2       Q    Yes.
3            But my point is, Mr. Cohen, when you say he is very
4   rich, and he pays all cash, you are not saying that you or
5   Mr. Trump or his sons go down to the bank with a bunch of bags
6   full of cash and buy something, you are saying that it's not
7   financed.  We are just going to pay with cash.
8            We are not going to finance, right?
9       A    That's correct.
10       Q    When you testified on Tuesday that President Trump
11   when he said, cash, was talking about green, that's not what he
12   is talking about, is it?
13       A    It was, which is why, sir, I used the word, no, no,
14   no, check.  We needed to do it by check.
15       Q    Hang on for a second.
16            When you say, we need to do it by check, that's when
17   this audio gets cut off, right?
18       A    It was not exactly after that.  It was after I
19   received a phone gall.
20       Q    Right.  As you say, check, or the word check is said,
21   it cuts off right then, correct?
22       A    No.  I believe there is a few seconds more where I say
23   hello to somebody on the phone.
24       Q    Now, which phone did you make that recording on?
25       A    On one of the two phones.

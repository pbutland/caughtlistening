1                So I'm trying to avoid that to the extent that I'm
2       able.
3                You asked me if we could possibly start early.  I'm
4       going to look into that and see if we could start early.
5                I think that we can work a little bit late on some
6       days, but unfortunately we can't work on Wednesday.
7                As of right now, we know that one of the alternates
8       can only work until 1:00 on Thursday.
9                I don't think that that's going to be a problem one
10       way or the other.
11                We will play it by ear and see how that plays out.
12       How much more do you think you have of Mr. Cohen?
13                MR. BLANCHE:  I think not a lot.  I think -- I
14       would say, I think I will be finished with cross Monday
15       before the morning break.
16                THE COURT:  All right.  Any sense of how long the
17       redirect might be?
18                MS. HOFFINGER:  No.  But I would say under an hour,
19       your Honor.
20                THE COURT:  Okay.  At this point, do you expect to
21       call any other witnesses on the direct case?
22                MR. STEINGLASS:  No, Judge.
23                THE COURT:  Other than the expert witness, that we
24       just discussed at this point, do you expect to present a
25       defense case?

1 right?
2 A The Judge advised me of such, yes.
3 Q The Judge reminded you that you are still under oath
4 because of your oath that you gave on Monday morning?
5 A Correct.
6 Q And that wasn't just here, that's happened any time
7 that you've testified and there has been a break, whether it's
8 overnight or even a lunch break; right?
9 A Correct.
10 Q So, in addition to the times that you testified under
11 oath where you raise your right hand and swore to tell the
12 truth, you've also met with Federal agents, I believe, somewhere
13 around 17 times?
14 Does that number sound right?
15 A Sounds right.
16 Q And each time you met with the Federal agents, you were
17 told that if you made a false statement, that that was a felony,
18 that was a Federal crime; correct?
19 A Yes, sir.
20 Q So you —— and just so that the jury understands, that
21 happens when the meeting starts.
22 So at some point early on you are in a conference room
23 usually and there are some agents, maybe some FBI Agents, there
24 are some prosecutors, your lawyer is there, and early on in the
25 meeting you are told, Mr. Cohen, you can't lie to these agents,

1                MR. BLANCHE:  We anticipate reaching a decision at
2       least with respect to any potential rebuttal witness very
3       soon, like today.
4                And we will communicate that to the folks -- to the
5       People and including the Court.
6                If we do have any rebuttal witnesses, we do not
7       anticipate that they would be long, at least on direct.
8                I don't think it's necessarily -- well, I don't
9       want to make commitments about the day on Monday, but it's
10       certainly reasonable to believe that if, aside from
11       Mr. Smith, that the witnesses will be able to get on and off
12       on Monday.
13                THE COURT:  And when you say "rebuttal witnesses,"
14       are you referring to the witnesses that we spoke about
15       earlier today or something else?
16                MR. BLANCHE:  The witnesses that we spoke about
17       earlier.
18                THE COURT:  All right.  So it sounds like we might
19       possibly be done with the presentation of evidence on
20       Monday.
21                MR. BLANCHE:  I was not speaking about President
22       Trump, obviously.
23                THE COURT:  Right.
24                MR. BLANCHE:  So that's another decision that we
25       need to think through.

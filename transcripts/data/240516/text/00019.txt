5 Good morning, jurors.
6 Welcome back.
7 Jurors, first, I would like to apologize for
8 keeping you waiting.
9 I know that you were all here early just waiting
10 for us, but we had to take care of some business. I
11 apologize for that.
12 Second, as you know, our scheduling the coming week
13 or weeks is kind of broken up by holidays and various
14 conflicts, so if possible it may be necessary for us to work
15 next Wednesday. However,, what I'm going to ask you to do
16 is let the Sergeant know during the next break if that
17 creates a hardship for any of you.
18 If any of you are unable to work next Wednesday, we
19 just won't be able to work and that's fine, that's okay, but
20 it's important so that we can plan.
21 Okay. Thank you.
22 Mr. Blanche.
23 MR. BLANCHE: May I inquire?
24 THE COURT: Yes.
25 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

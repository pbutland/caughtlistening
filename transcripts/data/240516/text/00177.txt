1   Sajudin, correct?
2       A    Correct.
3       Q    Now, you testified a lot about that on Monday, but
4   that story, by the way, is completely false, correct?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6       Q    And by, completely false, I mean, money was paid to
7   keep the story from getting out, but the story was false,
8   correct?
9       A    I believe so, yes.
10       Q    Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that it was
11   false?
12       A    No, sir.
13       Q    And isn't it true that at the time when you talked to
14   President Trump about this false story, he was worried about
15   the story getting out because of his employees, right?
16       A    He mentioned that I should speak to them as well, yes.
17       Q    Well, he told you, did he not or -- you previously
18   told law enforcement that he told you that he was concerned
19   about the story because it involved people that still worked
20   with him and worked for him, correct?
21       A    Yes, sir.
22       Q    And so, it was important to him to keep it from
23   getting out, correct?
24                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
25       A    Yes, sir.

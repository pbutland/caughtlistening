1       A.   Yes.
2                 MR. BLANCHE:  We offer B166.
3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  With redactions?
4                 THE COURT:  If you can make the necessary
5        redactions.
6                 MR. BLANCHE:  We'll redact it, of course,
7        absolutely.
8                 For now can it be shown to the jury and not in the
9        courtroom?
10                 THE COURT:  I don't know if you can do that.
11                 We were told that we can.
12                 It is being shown to the jury but not anybody else
13        in the Court.
14       Q.   Let's look at it with the jury.
15            Just to go back now to the conversation between you and
16   Keith.  "Who can I speak to regarding phone calls to my cell and
17   office, the dope forgot to block one of them."  That was at
18   7:48.
19            At 8:02 he said:  Call me.
20            I can put it back up again.
21            At 8:01 is when he leaves that voicemail?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   You call him back at 8:02 for 1 minute and 36 seconds.
24   At 8:04, you text him the number of the 14 year old who was
25   prank calling you; correct?

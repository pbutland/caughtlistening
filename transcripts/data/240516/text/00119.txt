1   House, that's correct.
2       Q.   Didn't you -- in the conversation I believe we're both
3   talking about, didn't you say that President Trump was very

5   yet?
6       A.   Right.  Yes, sir.
7       Q.   And then your daughter said, why not Special Counsel,
8   who else would they give that to, Trump is President, he has
9   the power to appoint anyone he wants; that's what she said to

12       Q.   And you told your daughter that you were disappointed
13   that the Chief of Staff, Mr. Priebus, was the one who got to
14   pick what your role was; right?
15       A.   Yes, sir.

17   credit for Mr. Priebus getting the job as Chief of Staff; right?
18       A.   Yes, sir.

20   daughter, was that now that the Chief of Staff that you had
21   helped President Trump pick was put in charge of finding you a
22   job; right?
23       A.   Again, my daughter may have called it Special Counsel
24   to the President.  The role that I had been asking President
25   Elect Trump for was Personal Attorney to the President, which is

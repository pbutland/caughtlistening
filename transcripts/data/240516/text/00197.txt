M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3946
1       A    Correct.
2       Q    So, do you remember when that phone call -- that
3   meeting with Mr. Santucci was in relation to 2016, October, and
4   when you told Mr. Davidson about it in March of 2018?
5       A    I said October.
6       Q    So, what did you say to Mr. Santucci, and what did he
7   say to you?
8       A    First, I was a little shocked that John Santucci
9   actually, did it.  Meaning, he had to spend quite a bit of time
10   following the Trump campaign, and then, of course, he denied
11   that they were involved.
12       Q    Now, did he -- do you recall Mr. Santucci asking you
13   whether you, meaning Mr. Cohen, was able to kill that story
14   because he said Ms. Daniels had gone dark?
15       A    Yes, sir.  That's what I was saying before.
16       Q    Okay, understood.
17            Now, when you met with the District Attorney, with Mr.
18   Pomerantz, so a while ago, do you remember saying that you
19   believed that Mr. Davidson on behalf of Ms. Daniels was
20   engaging in extortion?
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
22                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
23                 You can answer.
24       A    Yes.  I recall making a statement like that.
25       Q    What statement did you make?

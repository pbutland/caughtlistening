M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3936
1            Meaning, this conversation wasn't tied to the
2   election, it was a real concern that Mr. Pecker could get hit
3   by a bus at any time or something could happen to him and you
4   guys wouldn't have those files, right?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6       Q    Now -- and you said, I am all over it?
7            You said, I'm all over it, right?
8       A    Yes, sir.
9       Q    So, eventually, you learned that there was nothing in
10   those files, correct?
11       A    I was told by Mr. Pecker that, not to worry.  There is
12   nothing in the files.
13       Q    That was later though, right?
14       A    After he was not accepted as the CEO of Time.
15       Q    And then you testified about a comment that was made
16   in response to a question about financing.
17            And you say -- and President Trump says, what
18   financing?
19            And then there is a comment made about cash, right?
20       A    Yes, sir.  Mr. Trump turned around and used the word
21   cash.
22       Q    And when he says, cash, he is not talking about
23   Benjamins and green dollar bills, right?
24            He is talking about paying for something with cash,
25   not financing, correct?

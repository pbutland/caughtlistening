5       Q.   This is a series of texts between you and Mr. Schiller
6   on that same date.  You said:  "Who can I speak to regarding
7   harassing calls to my cell and office, the dope forgot to block
8   his call on one of them?"
9            Do you see that?
10       A.   I see it.
11       Q.   Mr. Schiller says --
12                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, reading a document not
13        in evidence.
14                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
15       Q.   Do you recall at 8:02, your initial text to Mr.
16   Schiller is at 7:48, and then at 8:02 he says, "Call me," to
17   you; right?
18       A.   Yes, sir.
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  So if we can put up what is already
20        in evidence as Exhibit 341 on the screen, please.

22       Q.   These are the phone calls between you and Mr. Schiller;
23   right?
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  And if we can go to the second page
25        and highlight the 10/24, the 8:01 and 8:02 calls, please.

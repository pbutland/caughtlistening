2 Q. But you knew when President Trump was running in 2015
3 and 2016, you knew the campaign at times was very frustrated
4 with you because you were going off message from what President
5 Trump and the campaign wanted; correct?
6 A. I knew they were upset about it. However, Mr. Trump
7 had turned around and advised me, I don’t answer to them. And
8 so, he’s free to speak on his own as I was not part of the
9 campaign. I was a surrogate.
10 Q. So your testimony is that the frustration towards you
11 didn't come from President Trump but it came from the campaign
12 staffers?
13 A. Correct.
14 Q. Going back to 2011, eventually President Trump says,
15 "I’m not going to run?"
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Several months later you worked with Mr. Davidson to
18 cause The Dirty to remove the article about Ms. Daniels;
19 correct?
20 A. Correct.
21 Q. That was in May or so, President Trump said he wasn’t
22 going to run; correct?
23 A. It was around the sweeps at the time.
24 Q. Much later, in 2011, is when The Dirty article came
25 down and you talked to Mr. Davidson; correct?

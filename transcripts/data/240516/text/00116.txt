4 CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION
5 BY MR. BLANCHE:
6 Q. That's what you eventually were, but I am talking about
7 in November 2016, did you and your daughter have a conversation
8 where you said that you're going to ask to be Special Counsel to
9 the President?
10 A. Yes, but I was referring to Personal Attorney to the
II President.
12 Q. Well, you talked about how, if you had that job, the
13 pay would be very low because you would be working in the White
14 House, correct?
15 A. No, I think that was for a different job.
16 Q. What job was that for?
17 A. That was supposed to be Assistant White House General
18 Counsel.
19 Q. So your testimony is, that when you said you want to be
20 Special Counsel to the President, you were talking about the job
21 you ultimately were awarded, to be his Personal Attorney?
22 A. No, sir.
23 Q. When you were talking —— when you had this intense
24 exchange about being Special Counsel to the President, that
25 would be you working in the White House as the Special Counsel,

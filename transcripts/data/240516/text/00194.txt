Proceedings

1 LIEUTENANT: Please be seated.
2 Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.
3 THE COURT: All right.
4 So we had a conference in the robing room with
5 one of the alternates who has indicated a conflict.
6 Counsel was there.
7 Have you had a chance to fill in your colleagues
8 on what was discussed?
9 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. I think our suggestion is
10 let's just not promise the jury that they are going to be
11 able to go home at one o'clock Thursday. Let's wait and
12 see where we are at in terms of what part of the case we
13 are up to, and then decide if it is feasible.
14 It's an alternate juror. We can decide whether
15 to keep the alternate juror or release them, depending on
16 where we are at.
17 MR. BLANCHE: That makes sense. I think that our
18 View would be, if it comes to it, and we need the
19 afternoon, which we probably will, we can address it then.
20 THE COURT: Okay. I agree.
21 Let's get the witness, please.
22 LIEUTENANT: Witness entering.
23 (Whereupon, the witness entered the
24 courtroom and was properly seated.)
25 THE COURT: Let's get the jury, please.

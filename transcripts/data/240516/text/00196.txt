1 Q Well, was that later?
2 A Yes. It was ABC.
3 Q So, and in particular, you were told that ABC had
4 offered, in essence, the same amount of money Mr. Davidson was
5 trying to get from you, correct?
6 A Correct.
7 Q $130,000?
8 A Yes, sir.
9 Q Who is the reporter that you, put aside whether it is
10 true, that Mr. Davidson told you about that was trying to
11 negotiate that with Ms. Daniels?
12 A I am actually blanking on his name.
13 Q Was it an individual named John Santucci?
14 A John Santucci, yes, sir, ABC News.
15 Q And you never confirmed one way or the other whether
16 that was true?
17 A I spoke to Mr. Santucci about it.
18 Q When did you speak to him?
19 A He contacted me and asked me whether or not I was
20 responsible, or I knew that we were responsible for them not
21 getting the story. John Santucci used to come to the office
22 quite a bit.
23 Q So, and you talked about that interaction you just
24 talked about in a recording that you made with Mr. Davidson
25 March 27, 2018, correct?

1                We are not seeking to offer virtually any of them.
2                They are just to refresh his recollection.
3                Now, the People are correct, there are a few that
4       we want to offer.
5                We -- look, the law -- I don't need to pass it up
6       to the Court -- but evidence of bias is always admissible
7       and extremely important.  And extrinsic evidence of bias is
8       always admissible.
9                And, of course, the Court can limit it
10       appropriately.
11                And we are being judicious, in our view, and we are
12       not offering 50 clips of him saying things.
13                We are -- we have a handful that are targeted to
14       his actual, in our view, his actual bias.
15                We are talking about -- I believe we are seeking
16       to actually admit three or four, maybe five short clips,
17       that is out of hundreds that we could potentially seek to
18       admit.
19                So evidence of bias is admissible.  We have a ton
20       of evidence of bias.
21                We are seeking to admit extrinsic evidence of bias,
22       which we are allowed to do.  And in a handful of cases --
23                THE COURT:  That's fine.
24                But if it appears that you are taking that out of
25       context, I have certainly no problem with the People going

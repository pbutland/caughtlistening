2       A    Correct.

5       A    Correct.
6       Q    And in both of those court hearings you testified, or

8       A    Correct.

21       Q    Exactly like what you did in this courtroom?
22       A    Correct.
23       Q    And when there are times, like now, when your testimony
24   lasts longer than a day, just because you come back the next day

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3872
1       A.   I stated I don't recall having a conversation with Mr.
2   Davidson about that.
3       Q.   Do you recall -- now we're talking we're in December
4   now of 2016, your daughter expressed that it was ridiculous that
5   Mr. Cohen was appointed and not you; correct?
6       A.   Correct.
7       Q.   And she also complained that you were having a hard
8   time getting tickets to the Inauguration Ball; correct?
9       A.   I believe so.
10       Q.   Your daughter said that President Trump and his new
11   people were walking all over you; correct?
12       A.   Yes, sir.
13       Q.   And you agreed with that, didn't you, at the time?
14       A.   At the time.
15       Q.   You also agreed with your daughter that President
16   Trump, and this is in December, isn't doing right by you in any
17   way; correct?
18       A.   I was still waiting for the title Personal Attorney to
19   the President.
20       Q.   And, ultimately, you got that title in January; right?
21       A.   Correct.
22       Q.   But you were disappointed that after all the work you
23   had done for President Trump for nine and a half years, nobody,
24   including President Trump, offered you a position in the White
25   House?

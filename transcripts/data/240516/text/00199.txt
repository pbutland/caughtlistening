1            Do you remember that?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Make no mistake, this was a completely legal, binding
4   contract?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6                 MR. BLANCHE:  Let's pull it up, Exhibit 276.
7       It's in evidence.
8       Q    You testified about this on Tuesday.
9            This is a very long contract, correct?
10       A    Correct.
11       Q    And it's signed by you, right?
12       A    It is.
13       Q    And Mr. Davidson?
14       A    Yes, sir.
15       Q    And Ms. Daniels?
16       A    Yes, sir.
17       Q    But Donald J. Trump never signed anything associated
18   with this agreement.  He didn't sign this agreement.
19            He didn't sign the side letter either, correct?
20       A    That's correct.
21       Q    But in your mind then, and now, this is a perfectly
22   legal contract, correct?
23       A    Yes, sir.
24       Q    What I mean by that is, a Non-Disclosure Agreement, an
25   NDA, a settlement between two parties happens all the time,

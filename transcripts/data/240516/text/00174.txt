2 Q The crime fraud exception, didn’t you testify that you
3 were recording —— that you recorded your client because you
4 wanted to convince Mr. Pecker that money was coming?
5 A That’s correct.
6 Q So, are you saying that you did the recording under a
7 client fraud exception?
8 A No. You asked if there are exceptions, and I said
9 yes, the crime fraud exception rule.
10 Q So, you ——
11 A I was just giving the example.
12 Q Just so I understand it, you surreptitiously recorded
13 your client so that you could play a privileged, recorded
14 communication between you and your client with a third—party,
15 that's what you did, right?
16 A That's correct.
17 Q And, again, you never —— you certainly didn’t tell
18 President Trump you were recording him, did you?
19 A I did not.
20 Q Now, you talked about 2015 when President Trump
21 announced he was going to run, and he comes down to Trump
22 Tower, he comes down the escalator, correct?
23 A Yes, sir.
24 Q Prior to that President Trump had launched an
25 Exploratory Committee in March of 2015, right?

1 My concern was that they would expand upon it and they would
2 ask me about Mr. Trump personally or some other account.
3 MR. BLANCHE: Now, if we could highlight the very
4 last paragraph.
5 (Displayed.)
6 Q It says: "Just because something isn't true doesn't
7 mean that it can't cause you harm or damage. I will always
8 protect Mr. Trump."
9 You wrote that; right?
10 A I did.
11 Q Now, when you wrote that, do you recall sending that
12 statement out to a ton of reporters?
13 A I sure did.
14 Q And you followed up that statement by sending it to
15 them, you followed up with some communications with them making
16 it clear that you believed and that you felt strongly that that
17 statement was completely true; right?
18 A I was validating the statement that I had sent out with
19 that paragraph.
20 Q When you say that you were validating it, you mean you
21 were telling the reporters that what you wrote was true?
22 A I wanted them to believe it was true, yes.
23 Q So did you call them and say; I want you to believe
24 this is true?
25 A No, sir.

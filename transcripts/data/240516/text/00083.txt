12 Q Well, did you have a practice of communication ——
13 deleting communications, generally, around that time, so March
14 of 2018?
15 A I didn’t have a specific practice of that, no.
16 Q But were there certain folks that you communicated
17 with over either Signal, Dust or WhatsApp that you encouraged
18 them to delete your communications with them?
19 A Yes.
20 Q Which people?
21 A On Signal it actually does it automatically. So,
22 people like David Pecker.

24 wife to delete her communications?
25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

1 suggest that you do something, something appropriate about
2 the relationship, which is fair, which is fine.
3 I think the People may very well be able to elicit
4 why the investigator was trying to comfort him and trying to
5 reassure him.
6 MS. HOFFINGER: And we will be seeking to put in
7 the full version, that's what we will be seeking to do.
8 MR. BLANCHE: We provided these to the People
9 midday yesterday.
10 I think if we would have gotten an objection to a
11 few of the lines, like that one, if it was anticipated, we
12 would have been able to agree to redact.
13 I'm getting into this right away, actually, so if I
14 could have two minutes, I can just go make sure I take that
15 out.
16 MS. HOFFINGER: Just so the record is clear, I
17 would say you sent me the redacted version of this exhibit
18 at 9:38 p.m. last night.
19 The original version I didn't object to, but the
20 redacted version you sent me late last night when I asked
21 for it is what I am objecting to.
22 THE COURT: So you need to take a moment to fix
23 that?
24 MR. BLANCHE: Excuse me?
25 THE COURT: You need two minutes?

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche

1   banker, whether or not I can get a HELOC there.
2            So, I did not believe that it was material and that's
3   why I said that I did not believe I should have been charged
4   with that crime as well.
5       Q    Are you finished?
6       A    I am now, yes.
7       Q    When you testified under oath and pled guilty that you
8   knew at the time that your false statements on that application
9   would be used as a decision by the bank, were you lying?
10                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
11                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
12       A    I took the global plea that was provided.
13       Q    Sir, sir, please don't make a speech. It was a simple
14   question.
15                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Your Honor, objection.
16                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
17                 Please answer the question.
18       Q    My question was, I wasn't looking for a global plea
19   explanation.  My question was a lot simpler than that.
20            When you testified under oath in front Judge Pauley
21   that you knew at the time that you filled out those forms that
22   the information you provided was going to be used by the bank
23   in making a decision about that HELOC, were you lying at the
24   time you made those statements?
25       A    Yes.

Proceedings
3759
1       what it's going to sound like, so let's wait on that.
2                MS. HOFFINGER:  One more thing, your Honor, and
3       that's it.
4                I believe the defense is offering B45, which is
5       texts from Jeremy Rosenberg and Michael Cohen.
6                They are excerpted, only certain portions of the
7       texts that, without context, the context that they've
8       excerpted out, are all of the very serious threats that
9       Mr. Cohen was receiving, including some death threats that
10       Mr. Rosenberg had to follow up on and our Office had to
11       investigate.
12                If they are seeking to admit texts of that nature,
13       well, first of all, we object.
14                We don't think that this should come in.
15                Your Honor had a concern about too much evidence
16       coming in about threats to witnesses, especially because we
17       have a jury who may be concerned.
18                But we are going to object to the exhibit.
19                There is one portion on the first page, that's just
20       about the phones, which would be admissible.
21                But the rest of it is all about Mr. Rosenberg's
22       trying to -- trying to make him feel better, given all of
23       these threats that were happening.
24                So we would object.  And if it's admissible, we
25       would like to put in all of the threats.

1       A.   That's not accurate.
2       Q.   You were not embarrassed that after all the work you
3   had done for him you were left being his Personal Attorney and
4   nothing more?
5       A.   That's the role that I wanted.  In fact, I asked Gary
6   Cohen who provided me with the attorney Orin Snyder.  And Orin
7   Snyder and I, for about an hour, sat with President Elect Trump
8   in his office expressing the reason why Personal Attorney to the
9   President was the exact role that I should play.  That's the
10   role that they gave to me because this was a way that I could
11   monetize that which I did.

14       Q.   Who is that?
15       A.   Darrell Scott was my co-founder of the National
16   Diversity Coalition for Trump.  He is a pastor in Cleveland,
17   Ohio.
18       Q.   The event that you -- the only event that you attended
19   during the campaign was at Pastor Scott's church; is that right?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   That is the one you spoke at?

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche

1   you ever accept a pardon from President Trump, correct?
2       A    Correct.
3       Q    And that was false, correct?
4       A    No, sir.
5       Q    Why was that not false?
6       A    I never asked for it.  I spoke to my attorney about it
7   because we had seen on television President Trump talking
8   about, potentially, pre-pardoning everybody and putting an end
9   to this, what I deemed to be a nightmare.
10            So, I reached out to my attorney to ask him whether or
11   not this is legitimate.
12       Q    So, when you were asked -- when you provided
13   testimony -- and, again, same thing happened on that occasion,
14   you had to prepare remarks that you provided the committee and
15   then you read into the record, right?
16       A    Yes, sir.
17       Q    And both of those prepared remarks in writing and also
18   when you said it in the record under oath you said, and I have
19   never asked for, nor would I accept a pardon from President
20   Trump, correct?
21       A    Correct.
22       Q    Now, that was on February 27th.
23            Do you remember about ten days later you were deposed
24   in the House Oversight Committee?
25       A    Yes, sir.

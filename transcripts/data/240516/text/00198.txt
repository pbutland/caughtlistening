M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3947
1       A    That they were extorting Mr. Trump.
2       Q    And the reason you said that is because of all the
3   factors you talked about on Monday or Tuesday, right, you said
4   that there was urgency because of the Access Hollywood tape,
5   correct?
6       A    Correct.
7       Q    And there was an election and in your mind, in your
8   mind, there was either two choices, pay it, or don't pay it,
9   and the story comes out, correct?
10       A    Yes, sir.
11       Q    But you went a long time without paying, correct?
12       A    Yes.  We went several weeks without paying.
13       Q    And, ultimately, though, you did?
14       A    Yes, sir.
15       Q    And we will talk more about that in a little bit.
16            But you referred in direct to this payment as a hush
17   money payment.
18            Do you recall that?
19       A    Yes.  It's been called, the hush money payment.
20       Q    I am not asking whether it's been called that.  I am
21   asking whether on direct you referred to it as a hush money
22   payment?
23       A    Yes, sir.
24       Q    And do you recall the prosecutor saying it was a
25   payoff.  And you said, yes.

1 Q Just so I understand your testimony, as you sit here
2 today, you have a specific recollection of that phone call on
3 June 16, 2016?
4 A Based upon the other documents that I was able to look
5 at, what it did was jogged into my memory, again, the story
6 that I have been telling in regard to this conversation.
7 Q I am still looking for an answer.
8 Do you have a specific recollection, or do you not
9 have a specific recollection?
10 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
11 A I recalled, as I had stated before, I recalled the
12 conversation based upon the other documents.
13 Q Well, I understand that, but my question isn't whether
14 you recall a conversation. I am asking you whether you recall
15 that conversation on that phone call, at that time, on that day
16 in June of 2016?
17 A Again, based off of the documents that I had looked at
18 and reviewed, I did.
19 Q Do you remember, for example, speaking for a very long
20 time with Chris Cuomo just mere seconds before this call?
21 A Yes, sir.
22 Q What were you talking to Mr. Cuomo about?
23 A We were talking about my appearance and we were
24 talking about different topics.
25 Q Were you talking about your feelings?

1       A    I believe so, yes.
2       Q    So it wasn't just President Trump's lawyers that asked
3   you about whether you lied in front of Judge Pauley, the
4   Assistant Attorney General asked you questions as well,
5   correct?
6       A    Correct.
7       Q    Now, when President Trump's lawyers did start asking
8   you questions, again, I am talking about questions at trial
9   last October 24th and 25th, do you remember being asked whether
10   when you told Judge Pauley that you were pleading guilty
11   because you were guilty, do you remember being asked whether
12   that was a lie, and you said, yes, that was a lie?
13       A    Correct.
14       Q    And you were asked again under oath last October
15   whether you lied more than once in front of Judge Pauley and
16   you said, yes?
17       A    Correct.
18       Q    And you believe you did lie more than once before
19   Judge Pauley, correct?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    You also answered a question, do you recall that the
22   reason why you lied was because the stakes affected you
23   personally, right?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And you agreed?

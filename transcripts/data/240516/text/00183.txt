1 you had a specific recollection and you said, yes, that you had
2 a specific recollection.
3 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.
4 THE COURT: Overruled.
5 Q And so, what I am trying to do is reconcile what you
6 said a few minutes ago, that you don’t have a specific
7 recollection, with what you just said, which is that you do.
8 For this phone call, do you have a specific
9 recollection of this phone call in June of 2016?
10 A Can you show me which phone call we are referring to?
11 Q Sure.
12 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put up, it’s already in
13 evidence, People’s Exhibit 349. And if we can go to
14 June 16, 2016, that phone call at 6:51 p.m., and just blow
15 that up, please.
16 (Displayed.)
17 A I am sorry.
18 Which date are we looking at?
19 Q We should be able to blow it up for you, Mr. Cohen.

21 6:51 p.m.
22 Do you see that?

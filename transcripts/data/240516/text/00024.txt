M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3773
1                THE COURT:  So, I, again, sustained an objection --
2                MS. HOFFINGER:  Uh-huh.
3                THE COURT:  I am going to allow it in and give you
4       an opportunity to then go back and reread it, if either
5       party wants to do.
6                MS. HOFFINGER:  I think we should keep it out.
7                MR. BLANCHE:  I mean --
8                MR. STEINGLASS:  Judge, let's not use the
9       unredacted version.
10                MS. HOFFINGER:  Or put in the fully unredacted
11       version; your choice.
12                MR. BLANCHE:  I believe it's appropriate, your
13       Honor, on redirect, if they believe that there is something
14       that is taken out of context, that they want to offer it,
15       then they can, but it's just that this is just the People's
16       belief.
17                THE COURT:  Except that right now we only have --
18       we have knowledge of it in advance before it even comes in,
19       we know in advance it's going to be taken out of context,
20       and we know that you have an unredacted version that you can
21       offer.
22                I don't think it makes sense for us to just play
23       that game.
24                Why don't you just go ahead and introduce the
25       unredacted portion.

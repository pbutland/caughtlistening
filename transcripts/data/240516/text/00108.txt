11 Do you feel like that is an inconsistent
12 statement?
13 MR. BLANCHE: I can go right to the testimony and
14 ask him to say, yes or no, about Southern District.
15 THE COURT: Why don't you skip whatever everybody
16 was arguing or saying and just get to the question?
17 All right?
18 MR. BLANCHE: All right.
19 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the
20 following occurred in open court.)

1 A My lawyer.
2 Q So did the Government ever tell you —— did the
3 Prosecutors from the Southern District ever say: If you don't
4 plead guilty we are indicting your wife?
5 A No. They spoke with my lawyer.
6 Q Well, based on what your —— so, to be clear, except for
7 what your lawyer told you, the only basis for you believing your
8 wife was going to get indicted was what your lawyer told you;
9 correct?
10 A Correct.
11 Q But you said on countless occasions that that pressure
12 of having your wife indicted and the short timeframe with which
13 you had to make a decision was the reason why you pled guilty?
14 A Yes, sir.
15 Q But on that day, when you were under oath, in front of
16 Judge Pauley, after you raised your right hand, Judge Pauley
17 asked you, didn't you —— didn't he say to you —— or, well, did
18 anybody offer you any inducements or threaten or force you to
19 plead guilty to enter into this plea guilty?
20 He asked you that; right?
21 A He did.
22 Q And you said, "No?"
23 A I accepted responsibility.
24 Q Sir, I didn't ask you if you accepted responsibility.
25 We will get to that.

1   personal funds?
2       A    Either from President Trump's -- from his own funds or
3   from The Trust.
4                MR. BLANCHE:  So if we can bring the third
5        paragraph down, now, please.
6                (Displayed.)
7       Q    This is responding directly to the allegations that
8   were in the Common Cause Complaint; right?
9       It says they are speculative, and that neither your LLC made
10   any in-kind contributions to Donald J. Trump for President or
11   any other Presidential Campaign Committee.
12       It also said, I think, accurately, that you were not a
13   Government employee.
14       And that's right; right?
15       That's correct?
16       A    That's correct.
17       Q    And that it doesn't constitute a campaign contribution
18   or expenditure and, therefore, the FEC lacks jurisdiction over
19   this matter; right?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    Now --
22                MR. BLANCHE:  We can take that down.
23       Q    -- that same day, well, that was February 13th.
24       The complaint was filed before that, right, the Common Cause
25   Complaint?

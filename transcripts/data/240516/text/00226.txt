1       that should be the end of it.
2                The -- in fact, the very fact that this is a
3       contested legal issue in the parties proposed instructions
4       to the jury is even more reason why this should be resolved
5       through argument before your Honor at pre-charge conference,
6       not something that we should be putting in expert
7       testimony -- expert testimony to discuss.
8                I think there are two other problems.
9                First, and unless I'm missing it somewhere, the
10       possibility of any testimony on the "Press Exemption" has

15       "Press Exemption" proposal from the outset.

19       disclose reciprocal discovery, including this expert
20       testimony.
21                We had to move the Court to compel reciprocal
22       discovery in November.
23                Your Honor granted that motion.
24                We didn't get the defense expert disclosure until
25       January, and then the entire point of pretrial notice of

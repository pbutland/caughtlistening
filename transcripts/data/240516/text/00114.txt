1       Q    He is like a record producer?
2       A    Former CEO of Motown, yes, sir.
3       Q    The same day that you spoke to your daughter about
4   Mr. Priebus being named Chief of Staff, you had a communication
5   with Mr. Massenburg where you, again, discussed whether you
6   would be Chief of Staff, correct?
7       A    Yes, sir.
8       Q    And you told him at that point you just don't know,
9   right?
10       A    Correct.
11       Q    And then the next day -- so, do you recall on or
12   around November 13th, President Trump picked Mr. Priebus to be
13   the Chief of Staff, right?
14       A    Yes, sir.
15       Q    You told your daughter you were disappointed?
16       A    That I wasn't considered, yes, sir.
17       Q    And as you testified on Tuesday, you said that
18   President Trump needed an insider and that's why you weren't
19   selected, correct?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    And your daughter was frustrated, at least she
22   appeared frustrated over texts, that President Trump didn't
23   talk to you about it before he picked Mr. Priebus, right?
24       A    I don't know if I would characterize it as frustrated,
25   as much as disappointed.

1   see, those are individuals.  The other ones are generally
2   corporations.
3       Q    Understood.  Thank you.
4       A    You're welcome.
5       Q    Now, jumping forward to -- still talking about the
6   HELOC loan, you testified that -- so, in February of 2016, you
7   get this HELOC loan from the bank, correct?
8       A    Correct.
9       Q    And that's the paperwork that you pled guilty to being
10   false -- providing false information, correct?
11       A    Correct.
12       Q    But when you opened that HELOC, line of credit, it had
13   nothing to do with Ms. Daniels, correct?
14       A    Correct.
15       Q    So we are fast forwarding now to October, and I
16   believe your testimony was that one of the reasons why you
17   decide to use the HELOC was because you could hide it from your
18   wife, correct?
19       A    That's correct.
20       Q    And while her name was on the HELOC loan, your
21   testimony is that it was paperless so, you thought that you
22   could move the money into the HELOC, pay Ms. Daniels and your
23   wife would not know?
24       A    Move the money out of the HELOC into the new company,
25   what became Essential Consultants, and, yes, she would not know

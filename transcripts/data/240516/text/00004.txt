1                But what they haven't included is just before that
2       clip and just after that clip his saying "that's not
3       appropriate, that's not what we should be wanting, what we
4       want is accountability, we should be seeking only
5       accountability, we should be seeking due process, a fair
6       jury, a fair Judge."
7                So the context has been excerpted out of that.
8                We are left with an excerpt of a clip talking about
9       excitement about seeing him in a jumpsuit, which, again, we
10       think your Honor has precluded evidence of potential
11       punishment or consequences in this proceeding.
12                So if that is admitted -- we object to it, but if
13       it's admitted, we are going to seek on redirect to submit
14       the clip and its context.
15                And there are other clips, the other clips are
16       similar in many ways, perp walk, handcuffs, et cetera.
17                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, we have provided all the
18       clips to the Defense (Sic).
19                Most of them --
20                MS. HOFFINGER:  To the Prosecution.
21                MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you.
22                MS. HOFFINGER:  That's okay.  That's all right.  I
23       feel the same way sometimes.
24                MR. BLANCHE:  To the Prosecution.  Most of them on
25       Tuesday.  More yesterday.

1 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
2 THE COURT: Overruled.
3 A. No, sir.
4 Q. The first time that you seen those texts in seven or
5 eight years was just a few minutes ago?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. Given that your testimony to this jury is still,
8 when you testified on Tuesday, that you had a specific
9 recollection of a phone call with President Trump on October
10 24th, at 8:02, for 1 minute and 36 seconds, that you were
11 telling the truth?
12 A. Based upon what was going on and based upon the other
13 message text messages and so on, regarding the Stormy Daniels
14 matter, yes, I believe I was telling the truth.
15 Q. So you were not basing your testimony on Tuesday based
16 upon your memory, you were basing it on documents that the
17 People showed you in prep; is that your testimony?
18 A. That refreshed my memory, yes, sir.
19 Q. Was that true for just phone calls or was it true for
20 other phone calls too?
21 A. I don't recall telephone calls on a specific date going
22 back to 2016. Based upon the records and based upon the
23 documents that you were reviewing.
24 Q. Mr. Cohen you just said that you don't recall phone
25 calls back in 2016. That is not what you testified to on

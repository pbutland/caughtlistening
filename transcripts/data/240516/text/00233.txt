1 greatly diminished.
2 Again, in fairness to you, I will consider your
3 arguments.
4 I will go back and reread the submissions, but
5 until and unless you hear differently from me, my ruling has
6 not changed.
7 If there is any question as to what the ruling is,
8 again, go back to Pages 1, 2 and 3.
9 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.
10 That's understood.
11 THE COURT: Sure.
12 What else?
13 Nothing else from either side?
14 MR. BLANCHE: No.
15 THE COURT: Let's talk schedule.
16 As we discussed a little bit, I'm doing everything
17 possible to avoid big breaks between summations, jury
18 charge, jury instructions and deliberations.
19 I will try not to break up summations, if at all
20 possible.
21 And as we discussed in the robing room, the
22 deliberations should follow immediately after the jury
23 charge.
24 It's not ideal for there to be a big lapse in time
25 between summations and the jury charge.

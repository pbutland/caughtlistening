1        was something improper about the question.  There is
2        evidence that it happened.
3                 THE COURT:  There is nothing improper about the
4        question except that we now know that you left the jury
5        with the mistaken impression.
6                 I appreciate the record you are making, Mr.
7        Steinglass.  I take instructions from the bench to the jury
8        very seriously.  So I weigh that heavily before I decide to
9        do it.
10                 I am going to give Mr. Blanche the opportunity to
11        do it himself.
12                 If I am not satisfied what he has done fairly and
13        completely cleans up the issue, I will take care of it.
14                 MR. STEINGLASS:  The last point I will make --
15        that's fine.  I don't know if the witness knows that the
16        Order was issued by the Court unsealing the fact of the
17        indictment on March 30th.
18                 THE COURT:  I realize that.  That's why I am
19        keeping my options open.  I might have to give the limiting
20        instruction.
21                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
22                 THE COURT:  Separately, I have been informed one
23        of the jurors apparently has a 1:30 appointment next
24        Thursday.  I have not yet spoken to that juror.  I would
25        like to take it up with that juror in the robing room

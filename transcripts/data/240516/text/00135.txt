1 witness and the Court.
2 Q. These are some notes from the meeting.
3 You didn't take these notes, did you, Mr. Cohen?
4 A. No, I did not.
5 Q. Do you see at the top the date March 7th?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. It started at 9 a.m.?
8 A. Yes, sir.
9 MR. BLANCHE: If we can go to Page 9, please.
10 Actually, the page before. If we can blow up the bottom
11 line that says October 23rd to 25th.
12 (Displayed.)
13 Q. Can you take a look at that to see if it refreshes your
14 recollection that you didn't return the phone call?
15 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we approach?
16 (Whereupon, there was a sidebar discussion held:)
17 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, this is classic Bornholdt.
18 He is not directing —— it is classic People v. Bornholdt.
19 He is not directing his attention to where he was asked the
20 question about it.
21 MR. BLANCHE: I don't understand what the
22 objection is.
23 THE COURT: The objection is, that you tried to
24 impeach him with an admission, but you haven't established
25 that he was asked the question about it.

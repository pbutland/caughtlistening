1        cleaned up.
2                 To be honest with you, I don't think cleaning it
3        up by the parties is the right way to go.  I think your
4        Honor ought to clarify the record and eliminate any
5        suggestion there was some kind of impropriety.
6                 I think those questions were entirely improper.
7        I think it should be up to the Court to cure it, not Mr.
8        Blanche.
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, there are texts between
10        Mr. Cohen and the detective where it's clearly --
11                 THE COURT:  What?
12                 MR. BLANCHE:  Where it's clear the news of the
13        indictment had leaked.
14                 Your Honor had sustained objections around that.
15        The questions were not asked out of the blue.  There was a
16        very good faith basis for the questions.  Indeed, the
17        detective said they told the New York Times before they
18        told you.  Nevertheless, it's done.
19                 I wasn't trying to do anything other than elicit
20        the fact, which is entirely appropriate, that a detective
21        assigned to this case thought it appropriate to tell a
22        witness it was done.
23                 You sustained the objection.
24                 Your Honor, I am happy to clean it up.  It
25        shouldn't be an instruction from the Court to assume there

2 Q You called the Southern District of New York
3 prosecutors and Judge Pauley fucking animals, correct?
4 A Correct.
5 Q But in addition to what we just talked about so, your
6 podcast statements, your statements on TikTok and your
7 statements to the pretrial services officer, you also testified
8 under oath that you did not commit tax crimes that you plead
9 guilty to before Judge Pauley, correct?
10 A I stated, again, that I never —— that I don’t dispute
11 the facts of the case, but that I should not have been
12 prosecuted. I have for the last six years, including in the
13 sentencing memo, said the same thing, again, again.
14 First time tax evader, never filing a late tax return,
15 paying the taxes, all the money in Capital One Bank located at
16 the base of the building I lived in, all the documents, all the
17 bank records provided to my CPA and organized in three—ring
18 tabulated books, which the FBI took, I don’t believe that I
19 should have been charged.
20 I should have been given the same opportunity as
21 everybody else when you receive a letter from the IRS
22 indicating that there is an issue with your taxes. I never
23 received that. And I never had an opportunity to meet with an
24 agent, with my lawyer or CPA, whomever, in order to keep this
25 civil. It immediately, within that 48 hours, went criminal.

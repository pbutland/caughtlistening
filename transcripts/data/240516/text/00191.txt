M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3940
1       Q    And you received a phone call from a bank, right?
2       A    Capital One Bank.
3       Q    And your testimony is that you answered that call?
4       A    I did.
5       Q    So, just so I understand, you are in a meeting with
6   President Trump talking to him about the financing or cash for
7   the McDougal story, and you are recording him, but the phone
8   rings, and you just answer that call?
9       A    I did.
10       Q    And what was the bank calling you about?
11       A    I don't specifically remember.  I just remember it was
12   a big issue.
13       Q    If you don't have a recollection --
14       A    If my recollection is correct, it was -- I was the
15   subject of identity theft the second time.  People were going
16   into the account and taking money out.
17       Q    Wait.
18            You do remember, or you don't remember?
19       A    I believe that's what it was.  I am not a hundred
20   percent certain.
21       Q    Well, you started out by saying, you don't remember.
22            Then gave a long explanation, and then you said you do
23   remember, but you are not a hundred percent certain.
24                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection your Honor.
25                 THE COURT:  Sustained.

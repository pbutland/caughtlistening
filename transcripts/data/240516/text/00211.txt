7 public; right?
8 A I believe so.
9 Q And that's a sealed document; right?
10 And you were not necessarily giving it to the reporters, but

12 A Yes, I may have showed it.
13 Q Well, do you have any doubt that you showed it?
14 A No, sir.
15 Q And you were very angry that the complaint had been
16 filed; right?
17 A I was.
18 Q And you told some reporters that you were going to seek
19 sanctions, potentially Rule 11 sanctions; right?
20 A Correct.
21 Q And, at that point, you were sick of having to defend
22 yourself from these frivolous allegations; right?
23 A Yes.

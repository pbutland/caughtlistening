1 THE COURT: Well, what’s wrong with it, it is a
2 very slippery slope.
3 As you know, we dealt with the whole presence of
4 counsel, appearance of counsel, advise of counsel, and we
5 don’t want to go there.
6 In fact, on this, unless I am mistaken in
7 reviewing the proposed jury charge, there was an
8 instruction there regarding the presence of counsel.
9 So I would stay away from that. I think you
10 asked enough questions on that.
11 MR. BLANCHE: Thank you.
12 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the
13 following occurred in open court.)
1 4 BY MR . BLANCHE:
15 Q Now, you testified about your work for the Trump
16 Organization.
17 You reported directly to President Trump, right?
18 A Correct.
19 Q And over the nine and a half years you worked for the
20 Trump Organization, you did work for the Organization, legal
21 work, correct?
22 A No. Not much legal work.
23 Q Well, were you assigned, for example, to help with new
24 projects, potential new projects?
25 A Yes, sir.

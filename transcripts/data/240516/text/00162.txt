1 Q. You never reached back out to a reporter, ever, without
2 first checking with President Trump?
3 A. It was my routine to always advise Mr. Trump, because
4 if the story that I was going to put out is not the way he would
5 want it; one, it would cause him to blow up at me. And, two, it
6 would probably mean the end of my job.
7 Q. Over the course of nine and a half years, every time
8 that you worked to change the narrative of a story, you did that
9 never on your own, only in consultation with President Trump?
10 A. For the story, yes. Always in consultation, but
11 remember, one magazine, one newspaper would pick up the same
12 story. So I would use the same statement over and over and over
13 again. So with those, I would not go to Mr. Trump and tell him.
14 I would just send it out to my list of reporters. Or if they
15 contacted me, hey, we're looking for a comment on so and so.
16 Generally what would happen, after one newspaper puts out a
17 story, somebody else tends to follow and so we just mimic the
18 same response to the next magazine or the next newspaper and so
19 on.
20 Q. There were plenty of times, Mr. Cohen in 2015 and 2016,
21 for example, that you would comment about stories without
22 speaking to President Trump at all; isn't that true?
23 A. No, sir. I would always get a comment or something in
24 line with a conversation that we had on that specific topic.
25 Again, if I did that, and he didn't like the response, it would

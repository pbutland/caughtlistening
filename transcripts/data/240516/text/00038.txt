1   media; right?
2       A    I believe so, yes.
3       Q    Well, let me just make sure I understand your answer.
4   You did know at the time or you believed that a paralegal was
5   monitoring your social media?
6       A    I believe that there was a paralegal monitoring my
7   social media.
8       Q    And you knew that that was happening when you made all
9   of the statements that you made in the past several months,
10   including during this trial; correct?
11       A    Yes, sir.
12       Q    But that didn't -- it certainly didn't stop you; did
13   it, Mr. Cohen?
14       A    No, sir.
15       Q    Now, I want to talk about something the prosecutors
16   talked about for awhile on Tuesday, which is your prior -- your
17   prior testimony under oath.
18       Now, you testified under oath on many occasions; right?
19       A    That's correct.
20       Q    Many over the years.  You have testified in
21   depositions; correct?
22       A    Correct.
23       Q    You testified before Congress seven times; is that
24   right?
25       A    That's correct.

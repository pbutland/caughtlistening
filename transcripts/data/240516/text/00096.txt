M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3845
1       notice of the fact that the indictment was unsealed on the
2       evening of March 30th and give a curative instruction to
3       the jury of that fact.
4                 THE COURT:  Mr. Blanche.
5                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, there was sustained
6       objections to the fact that Detective Rosenberg told Mr.
7       Cohen before the matter was unsealed that, it is done, and
8       that was sustained, and the exhibit is not in evidence.
9       And there was a series of interviews that were done by this
10       witness that he testified about before and after that date.
11                 And so, to the extent that the Court either on
12       redirect or even on cross, I can elicit the fact that the
13       indictment was unsealed on a particular day is fine.  I
14       don't think a formal curative instruction about a couple of
15       questions is necessary.
16                 MR. COLANGELO:  I am looking at the real-time
17       transcript, your Honor, so this may not be perfectly
18       accurate, but Mr. Blanche asked a series of questions:
19                 Do you recall on March 31st going on TV with a
20       reporter named, Joy Reid?
21                 Yes, sir.
22                 Question:  And, again, this is Friday,
23       March 31st, so it's when the indictment is still under
24       seal?
25                 Correct.

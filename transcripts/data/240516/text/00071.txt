1       Q    And it was taking the oath at one of those hearings in
2   February 2019, correct?
3       A    Correct.
4       Q    Now, when you testified in front of Congress in 2019,
5   you testified that you confessed to your mistakes about taxes
6   and other mistakes and plead guilty to that, correct?
7       A    Correct.
8       Q    Did you tell Congress, either the House or the Senate,
9   that, actually, you had lied to Judge Pauley?
10       A    I did not.
11       Q    So, on Tuesday you talked about omissions.
12            Would you agree with me that by not telling Congress
13   or the Senate that you had lied under oath, that you were
14   omitting important information?
15                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
16                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
17       A    I don't believe I was asked the question.
18       Q    Well, if we can go to, again, just for the witness,
19   the parties and the Court, B-518.  And there is a long back and
20   forth when Congressmen ask you questions, they go on and on,
21   correct?
22       A    Yes, sir.
23       Q    Even more than I do.
24            If we can go to page 36, excuse me.  Sorry.  Page 32,
25   and then if you can read, Mr. Cohen, the bottom of page 32 and

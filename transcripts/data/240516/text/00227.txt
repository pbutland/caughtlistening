1       proffered expert testimony is so the parties can prepare.
2                  We filed a motion in limine to exclude their
3       expert testimony.
4                Your Honor largely granted it.
5                And we have prepared a potential rebuttal witness
6       based on the language in your Honor's -- the Court's
7       March 18th Order.
8                So to expand Mr. Smith's testimony at this point,
9       just a few days before he may take the stand, presents a
10       significant notice problem as well because our witness, in
11       reliance on the Court's Order, we have not prepared him to
12       talk about the facts about a D.C. Circuit case or the
13       Orloski case or the Buckley versus the Valeo Supreme Court
14       decision or how it applies.
15                So, your Honor, what Mr. Bove just described is
16       totally outside and way beyond both what your Honor already
17       ruled and any recognized exception to the general
18       prohibition on legal testimony from an expert.
19                MR. BOVE:  We are not seeking to have three people
20       at this trial instruct the jury about these issues, Judge,
21       and that's exactly why I'm raising this -- why we're raising
22       this right now, which is that the changed circumstance, from
23       our perspective, is:  I don't think there was a -- to our
24       understanding, there was not an agreement prior to the start
25       of this trial that your Honor would provide instructions to

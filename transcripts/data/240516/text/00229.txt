Proceedings
3978
1       defense and the FEC's analysis of whether or not there was a
2       campaign contribution both in the Non-Prosecution Agreement
3       and in the Conciliation Agreement.
4                And so --
5                THE COURT:  People, anything else?
6                MR. COLANGELO:  Yes, your Honor.
7                Just two quick points and one to correct the
8       record.
9                My recollection is that Ms. Necheles said to your
10       Honor at a bench conference last week, before any of the
11       proposed jury instructions were in, that they intended to
12       raise with your Honor, to question what their expert would
13       be permitted to testify to.
14                So I'm not sure that we can credit the
15       characterization that this proffer and these instructions
16       are necessitated by differences of opinion regarding the law
17       in the proposed jury instructions.
18                And then, second, on the press exemption, as you
19       know, your Honor, we haven't yet responded to the submission
20       that the defense put in the other day.
21                I'm not sure, as I stand here right now, that we
22       will oppose the exclusion of the language in the charge to
23       define the "Press Exemption," but the "Press Exemption" is
24       why this entire undertaking is way beyond what any witness
25       should testify to.

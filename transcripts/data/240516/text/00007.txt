Proceedings

1 I apologize.
2 One of the clips that they are offering talks about
3 Mr. Cohen —— from 2020, talks about Mr. Cohen's —— the cases
4 that are —— the investigations that he believes are out
5 there, meaning the Southern District investigation and the
6 OAG investigation and an investigation by our Office.
7 And he talks about speaking with our office about
8 all sorts of financial crimes.
9 So if that does come in, that does open the door,
10 your Honor, because that was ongoing into 2021 and that was
11 on the clip.
12 So we would certainly seek to clarify about that,
13 so it will open the door.
14 And we will argue that it does.
15 MR. BLANCHE: Well, it's a short clip.
16 And he does make reference to the fact that he has
17 gone to the District Attorney's Office about all kinds of
18 financial crimes as well.
19 To the extent that the People believe that opens
20 the door to then redirecting him on evidence of financial
21 crimes, then that certainly opens the door to a whole series
22 of questions that I was not —— that I did not ask about,
23 what this District Attorney thought about his testimony with
24 respect to those financial crimes.
25 I mean ——

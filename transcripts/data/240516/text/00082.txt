M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche

1 Q You, by the way, you remember on March 9, 2018,
2 Ms. Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, put out a public
3 statement regarding the fact that you had paid $130,000 from
4 the HELOC?
5 Do you remember that?
6 A Yes, sir.
7 Q And you issued your own statement at the time and you
8 said, in part, the funds were taken from my home equity line
9 and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank,
10 correct?
11 A Correct.
12 Q And you testified on Monday, and just a few minutes
13 ago, that you decided to do it this way, it was quick, you
14 could move the money quickly and because you wanted to conceal
15 it from your wife, correct?
16 A Correct.
17 Q And you separately said on your podcast that your wife
18 had no knowledge of the HELOC prior to March 2018, correct?
19 A Not that she didn’t have knowledge of the HELOC, that
20 she didn’t have knowledge of the transaction.
21 Q That's a fair correction.
22 So, of course, she knew that you had a HELOC. She
23 didn't have knowledge of what you testified about, that you
24 moved $131,000, right?
25 A Correct.

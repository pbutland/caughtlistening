1                THE COURT:  All right.  We will do that after the
2       jury is excused today.
3                MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, your Honor.
4                MR. BOVE:  Yes, your Honor.
5                MR. STEINGLASS:  Are you going to ask the jury
6       about their availability on Wednesday?
7                THE COURT:  Yes.
8                So what I would normally do, I just tell the
9       jurors, look, it's possible we may need to work on
10       Wednesday, would that present a hardship for any of you?  If
11       it does, raise your hand.
12                I don't -- I'm not crazy about putting them in that
13       position.
14                But I prefer to do that rather than have a court
15       officer or somebody else ask those questions.
16                MR. BLANCHE:  Okay.
17                MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, may I raise another issue?
18       It's very short, and I apologize.
19                On Tuesday, someone -- some of the defense guests
20       filed in in the middle of direct examination with their
21       security detail.
22                And I noticed that some of his guests are already
23       here today with their security detail.
24                But we would just ask that they not be allowed to
25       file in, in the middle of Mr. Blanche's cross-examination.

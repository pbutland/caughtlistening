1 request to charge that, alternatively, we would have
2 Mr. Smith describe, again, just to give the jury a little
3 bit of content around these terms.
4 And I say that, and make this whole proffer with a
5 little bit of concern that we don't want to be treading on
6 your Honor's legal instructions.
7 These are things that, coming into the trial,
8 based on the in limine ruling, we had hoped to do through
9 Mr. Smith.
10 Now, you have these two competing jury instructions
11 and so there is a little bit of tension here, and so we
12 wanted to ——
13 THE COURT: So you believe that the biggest impetus
14 to this is to ask this Court about —— to argue that we now
15 have two competing instructions, not the facts of the case
16 or that the testimony has changed, just the request for the
17 instructions?
18 MR. BOVE: The reason that I'm making the proffer,
19 your Honor, if the instructions had not come in, in the way
20 that they had, meaning that if the parties were not in
21 agreement at least with respect to the question of should
22 the Court give instructions about FECA and these terms, we
23 understand —— we think we understand what your Honor's in
24 limine ruling says and we were going to abide by that
25 through Mr. Smith.

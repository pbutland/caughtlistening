1       Q    And that's because of the explanation that you gave in
2   this courtroom just a minute ago?
3       A    Yes, sir.
4       Q    So, do you remember on Tuesday when the prosecutor
5   asked you about your testimony that I am talking about now, and
6   the prosecutor said to you, that you answered questions in
7   response to -- in response from President Trump's lawyer?
8            Do you remember that?
9       A    I am sorry.  Can you say that again?
10       Q    When the prosecutor was asking about your testimony
11   last October on Tuesday, do you remember those questions?
12       A    I remember they were asking me questions, yes.
13       Q    I am not asking if you remember the questions from
14   October.
15       A    That's way the question sounds --
16       Q    I am asking if you remember the questions from Tuesday
17   from Ms. Hoffinger?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    And she said to you that you answered questions that
20   were put to you by President Trump's lawyers in October, right?
21       A    Correct.
22       Q    But the questions that you just talked about, those
23   were when you talked about the HELOC, and when you talked about
24   the fact that there was no tax evasion, that was in response to
25   questions from the Assistant Attorney General, correct?

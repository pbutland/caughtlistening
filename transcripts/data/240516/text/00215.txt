1       A    That's correct.
2       Q    And they were the ones that wrote the letter, which is
3   201; correct?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    So -- and you worked with them to make sure that the
6   statement was truthful; correct?
7       A    I did.
8       Q    And you worked with them to make sure that the letter
9   was truthful; correct?
10       A    I worked with them to put this letter out, which,
11   again, I have characterized as deceptive.
12       Q    I understand your characterization of it, but the
13   reality is, we just read it.  Nothing on that letter is not the
14   truth; correct?
15       A    Correct.
16       Q    So -- but is it your testimony that you were lying to
17   your lawyers, to the McDermott lawyer?
18       A    No, sir.
19                MS. HOFFINGER:  I'm going to object here, Judge.
20                THE COURT:  Sustained.
21                MR. BLANCHE:  I'm going to move to another area.
22                THE COURT:  Why don't we stop at this point.  All
23       right.
24                Jurors, I know that we were going to stop today by
25       4:00, so we are going to stop now.

2 Q This is the statement that you issued the same day;
3 right?
4 A Correct.
5 Q And you wrote that?
6 A Yes, sir.
7 Q We won't read the whole thing, but you said on Tuesday,
8 that you didn't plan to provide any further comment because you
9 were worried that by issuing the statement you would start
10 getting a lot of calls; right?
11 A I wrote that, yes.
12 Q And that's why you wrote that on the second to last
13 paragraph; right?
14 A No, sir.
15 Q No, that's not why?
16 A That's not why.
17 Q I must have misunderstood your testimony from Tuesday.
18 You didn't want to provide any further comment; right?
19 A That's correct.
20 Q And the reason why you put that in the statement is
21 because you were worried that if you just sent out a statement
22 without that, reporters would want you to comment; right?
23 A They would be asking me the question, in the paragraph
24 above it, "Neither The Trump Organization nor The Trump Campaign
25 was a party to the transaction."

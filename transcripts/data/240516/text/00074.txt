M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3823
1   one of the benefits you get of pleading guilty is a little bit
2   of time off your sentence because you accepted your
3   responsibility, correct?
4       A    That's correct.
5       Q    So when you were sentenced in December the Judge took
6   into account that you had accepted responsibility for your
7   crimes, correct?
8       A    I don't know what the Judge made his determination on.
9       Q    Well, you know that under the guidelines calculation
10   you get time off for accepting responsibility, correct?
11       A    You do.  You get a reduction.
12       Q    And you got that reduction for accepting
13   responsibility, correct?
14       A    Correct.
15       Q    By pleading guilty, correct?
16       A    I plead guilty.
17       Q    And for timeliness of your guilty pleas, right?
18       A    Correct.
19       Q    So, my question is, again, when you got the credit at
20   sentencing for accepting responsibility you got that credit
21   even though you lied, you lied to the Judge when you pled
22   guilty?
23       A    Again, I don't know how Judge Pauley made his
24   determination.  Judges, as you know, have a wide range of
25   discretion over guidelines.

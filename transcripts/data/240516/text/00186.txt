1   which was Mr. Pecker, right?
2       A    Correct.
3       Q    And the information you were talking about
4   transferring was, supposedly, all kinds of -- a secret box
5   about bad information on President Trump, right?
6       A    That's correct.
7       Q    And at the time there was a concern because AMI was
8   looking to potentially acquire Time Magazine or the other way
9   around, right?
10       A    No, sir.
11       Q    What was happening?
12       A    David Pecker was being considered to be the CEO of
13   Time Incorporated, Time Magazine, and the concern was being
14   that these documents were the property of AMI, that he would
15   not be able to, of course, take them.  That whoever the new CEO
16   might be, may end up not being as supportive of Mr. Trump as
17   David was.
18            And so, we were concerned that potentially one of
19   those stories could be leaked.
20       Q    And you -- and President Trump said, he could get hit
21   by a bus, meaning something could happen to Mr. Pecker, and the
22   rest would be the same, correct?
23       A    Correct.
24       Q    Now, the concern here was even beyond the election,
25   right?

8 the present sense, like you testified under oath ten days

11 A That I personally.
12 Q So when you testified under oath at the deposition on
13 February —— excuse me, on March 6th, that you were talking
14 about the present tense, that was not true?
15 A No. It was the present tense, that I —— I was not

18 said, I have never asked for, nor would I accept a pardon from

22 Q But were you also —— did you also mean that you didn’t
23 personally ask for it, you had your lawyers ask for it?
24 A Yes, sir, to explore it. Because, again, as I wrote,
25 or as I stated, it was being dangled.

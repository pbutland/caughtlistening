M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche

1 Q And you had been hearing on television that they were
2 dangling pardons. So, you directed your lawyer, hey, find out
3 if I can get a pardon. I want this nightmare to end, right?
4 A Not if I can get a pardon. If the President was going
5 to be doing these pre—pardons.
6 Q But you —— you testified that you were 100 percent
7 open to accepting it, anything to end this, right?
8 A Yes, sir.
9 Q And so —— and you did that with a couple of your
10 lawyers, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Costello, correct?
11 A Mr. Costello was never my lawyer.
12 Q Well, you asked Mr. Costello, putting aside whether he
13 was your lawyer, you asked Mr. Costello to reach out to people
14 in the administration, including Mr. Giuliani, about the
15 possibility of a pardon?
16 A We spoke about it.
17 Q And as part of your conversation with him, you asked
18 him to reach out to Mr. Giuliani and explore it, correct?
19 A Yes, sir.
20 Q And so, when you testified under oath less than one
21 year later, February, on February 27th, 2019, that you never
22 asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon, that was a lie,
23 wasn't it?
24 A At the time it was accurate.
25 Q Well, the very next day —— so, again, February 27th,

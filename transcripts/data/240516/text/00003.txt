Proceedings
3752
1       hostility towards the defendant; his making money off the
2       defendant.
3                And we did not even object to the exhibit relating
4       to some of his merchandise -- we felt that it was going to
5       come in, in any event -- but in that merchandise there are
6       pictures of the defendant behind bars, in an orange
7       jumpsuit.
8                Enough of that has come in at this point.
9                A number of these clips, we think, are precluded by
10       your Honor's decision on the motion, on the People's motion
11       in limine, which is, they reference opinions about whether
12       he should be in jail, whether he should be in handcuffs,
13       whether he should have a mug shot taken.
14                First, our Office did not take mug shots, did not
15       take fingerprints.
16                Mr. Cohen probably is not I aware of that -- it's
17       not something that he may or may not be aware of.
18                But, at this point, we really think that this is
19       intended to elicit something quite improper for the jury.
20                 And so, B35 -- just to go over a few of them --
21       B35 -- the other thing is that they are taken out of
22       context.
23                So, for example, B35, had Mr. Cohen talking about,
24       you know, something like mental excitement about seeing him
25       in an orange jumpsuit, which is what they have excerpted.

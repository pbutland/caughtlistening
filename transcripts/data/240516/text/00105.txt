1 cooperating witness?
2 A You have to be a cooperating witness.
3 Q And you were never offered a Cooperation Agreement,
4 right?
5 A Correct.
6 Q And in response to that question, and on October 24th,
7 the question was whether you received a 5K1 or substantial
8 assistance letter, you said you refused such a letter, correct?
9 Do you remember saying that?
10 A I do.
11 Q That's not true, is it?
12 A It’s true.
13 Q So all of your efforts of cooperation, the Rule 35
14 Motion and every time you asked for early termination of
15 supervised release because you are a cooperating witness, your
16 testimony is that you refused a 5K1 letter is truthful?
17 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
18 THE COURT: Overruled.
19 A Yes, it’s truthful. The 5K1 concept was given to Guy
20 Petrillo, my lawyer, that was after I had pled, after the 48
21 hours that I was given to plead. And so, I turned it around
22 and I said, I am not interested. So let’s not even talk about
23 it.
24 Q Who did you say that to?
25 A Guy Petrillo, my lawyer.

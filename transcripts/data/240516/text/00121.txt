M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
3870
1   Personal Attorney to the President of the United States.
2       Q.   Well, early in November Mr. Cohen, there were no
3   communications about Personal Attorney, all the communications
4   were about whether you would be Chief of Staff and then Special
5   Counsel to the President in the White House; correct?
6       A.   That was for my ego, yes.
7       Q.   Well, two questions ago you said you always just wanted
8   to be the Personal Attorney.  But I'm looking at text messages
9   in November where you're not talking about being Personal
10   Attorney, Mr. Cohen, you're talking about wanting a job in the
11   White House as Special Counsel to the President Trump; correct?
12       A.   No, sir.
13            If you look at the texts my daughter, I turn around and
14   I state to her that I'm not the right person for Chief of Staff.
15   Also, I also would not expect that I would be Attorney General
16   because it wasn't within my qualifications.
17       Q.   But, you did think you were the right person to be
18   Special Counsel to President Trump, you told that to your
19   daughter; correct?
20       A.   Personal Attorney to with Donald J. Trump is what I
21   wanted.  Later on in the text messages you see the clarification
22   in that title name.
23       Q.   So, later on, meaning in December and maybe in January,
24   you clarified to your daughter about what you meant in November;
25   is that what you said?

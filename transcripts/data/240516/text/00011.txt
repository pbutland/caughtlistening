Proceedings

1 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche.
2 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we redacted it for
3 that —— for the reason the People just said, that there is
4 some back and forth around threats.
5 The excerpts that we are offering are 100 percent,
6 in our view, continue to go to Mr. Cohen's bias.
7 They are accounts about Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Cohen
8 talking about holding President Trump accountable, I
9 believe, and he will hold him accountable, and then a
10 further question about the fact that Mr. Rosenberg knows
11 about Mr. Cohen's father.
12 We are not going to get into any details about
13 that, but it goes to show the relationship that
14 Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Cohen had.
15 So much so that there is a witness, and the
16 detective knows details —— and we are not getting into
17 details about his father, we're not getting into that, just
18 to point out that they had a very close relationship.
19 As the Court knows, the phones are an issue, and
20 that's what we are trying to bring out.
21 THE COURT: What you are describing ——
22 MS. HOFFINGER: I am handing up ——
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 MS. HOFFINGER: I can hand up the exhibits, your
25 Honor, the redacted and unredacted versions for you to

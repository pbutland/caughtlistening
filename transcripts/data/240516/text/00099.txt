1 Thank you for considering that.
2 Mr. Blanche.
3 CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION
4 BY MR. BLANCHE:
5 Q So, Mr. Cohen, before the break, well —— so, you
6 testified earlier this morning you were never offered a
7 Cooperation Agreement with the Southern District of New York,
8 correct?
9 A That’s correct.
10 Q Same thing with the Special Counsel, with Mueller,
11 right?
12 A Correct.
13 Q The same thing, you are not a cooperating witness in
14 this case either?
15 A No, sir.
16 Q The Attorney General, the trial that you testified
17 about before the break, you were just a witness in that case as
18 well?
19 You were not a cooperating witness, right?
20 A Correct.
21 Q But is it fair to say that one of the reasons that you
22 accepted responsibility and pled guilty in August and then
23 again in November was because you wanted to explore
24 cooperation, correct?
25 A Can you clarify that?

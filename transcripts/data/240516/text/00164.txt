1 A. Yes, sir.
2 Q. So fair to say that the first time that you heard about
3 that incident and the story by Ms. Daniels is when you talked to
4 President Trump about it, he said that he was worried about what
5 his family would think; correct?
6 A. Yes, as well as, of course, for the brand.
7 Q. Well, do you recall meeting with law enforcement on
8 February 18, 2021, and saying that the first thing that
9 President Trump said to you was that his family won't like that
10 very much; that's true, right?
11 A. That is true.
12 Q. And often, including on that occasion, you handled that
13 type of story by threatening legal action; right?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Whether it's a cease and desist by you or by another
16 party, that's a frequently common way that you handled negative
17 stories or stories that you want to be taken off of websites or
18 not be published?
19 A. Along with —— The Dirty was actually effectuated by
20 Keith Davidson, not by myself.
21 Q. Understood.
22 But my question was: Who did it?
23 The question was: The plan was for you and Mr.
24 Davidson to threaten legal action. A letter was written by Mr.
25 Davidson and it worked?

1       Q    Or did you call them and say; it is true?
2       A    I called and told them, this is true.
3       Q    And you -- you also, and this is, again, is in February
4   of 2018, you recorded yourself talking to reporters, telling
5   them that your statement was true; right?
6       Among other things?
7       A    Amongst other things, yes.
8       Q    And you did that -- you even said, and correct me if
9   I'm wrong, to one reporter, they had to believe you, that you
10   are a really bad liar.
11       You said that; right?
12       A    I believe so, yes.
13       Q    But the testimony in this trial is that you were lying
14   to them when you told them that; right?
15       A    Yes, sir.
16       Q    And you recorded them, at that time in 2018, for what
17   reason?
18       A    I don't recall.  I don't recall why I recorded it.
19       Maybe it was a different part of the conversation.
20       Q    So it may have been for some other reason other than
21   what we're talking about on the screen and what you were talking
22   about as far as trying to validate your statement?
23       A    Yes, sir.
24       Q    And that statement, by the way, was approved by your
25   lawyers at the time, at McDermott Will & Emery; is that right?

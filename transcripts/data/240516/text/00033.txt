1 Q And what you just said about picturing President Trump
2 being led through the booking process and whatnot, that wasn’t
3 the first time, meaning May 23rd, 2023, that wasn't the first
4 time that you said you wanted President Trump to get a taste of
5 what you went through; right?
6 A Correct.
7 Q So, do you remember a podcast, October 23rd, 2020,
8 where you discussed similar things.
9 Do you remember that?
10 A Specifically, no, but I’m sure I did.
11 Q Well, let’s take a listen.
12 MR. BLANCHE: If you would play that just for the
13 Court, the parties and the witness.
14 If we could play B25.
15 So, sir, if you could put your headphones on
16 again, Mr. Cohen.
17 Thank you.

22 A Correct.
23 Q It was just a small portion?

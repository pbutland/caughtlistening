1       review.
2                Clearly, it goes to the witness' state of mind.
3                So they can't bring in texts that are in response
4       to the threats, because they then are not bringing in
5       fulsome understanding of his state of mind at the time.
6                MR. BLANCHE:  I agree with that.
7                I would ask them to represent which one that we're
8       offering is in response to a threat?
9                MS. HOFFINGER:  Sure.
10                At the bottom, where -- on your redacted version,

18       telephone calls and the calls to his wife and the threats
19       that he received from someone who was with an online
20       program.

22       what's redacted.
23                THE COURT:  So, it sounds like if what you are

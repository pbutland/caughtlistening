2       Q.   But there were a number of times when you gave Ms.
3   Haberman a scoop, as you testified about, on Tuesday?
4       A.   Yes, sir.
5       Q.   Even at times -- by the way, you recorded a lot of
6   conversations that you had with reporters; right?
7       A.   No, sir, I won't characterize it as a lot.
8       Q.   How many would you characterize it as?
9       A.   Forty.
10       Q.   So 40, with 40 separate reporters, or just a handful of
11   reporters that you recorded?
12       A.   Over the ten years, it was probably a little more than
13   a handful.
14       Q.   Why did you record conversations you were having with
15   reporters?
16       A.   I used to use the recordings as well -- as sort of to
17   memorialize it for note taking, so I could go back and listen to
18   it, instead of not paying attention when I was talking to them.
19            Especially if it revolved around being a surrogate for
20   the campaign.  That way, I could use the conversation to figure
21   out what was the best response when I was on television, so that
22   it made sense and that it was what I believed Mr. Trump would
23   want.
24       Q.   Well, have you stopped -- did there come a time when
25   you stopped recording conversations with reporters?

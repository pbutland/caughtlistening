1   you had consented to the District Attorney doing; correct?
2       A    Correct.
3       Q    And I'm going to show you, just for you, the parties
4   and the Court, what has been marked for identification as B117.
5   And I'm going to ask that you take a look at that.  And it's a
6   couple of pages and it's redacted.
7       I'm sorry.  It's a couple of pages.
8       So we will flip through pages while you just take a look at
9   it and let me know if that appears to be the texts, some of the
10   texts you had with Detective Rosenberg?
11                (Witness reading.)
12                MR. BLANCHE:  We can flip through as well.
13                (Witness reading.)
14       Q    Do those appear to be the texts you -- some of the
15   texts that you appear to have with Detective Rosenberg?
16       A    Yes, sir.
17       Q    Now, there are -- these aren't all of the texts,
18   though, correct, what you are looking at?
19       A    So far, no.
20                MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, may we approach for a
21       moment?
22                THE COURT:  Sure.
23                (At Side Bar.)

25                MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, there are addresses all over

Proceedings
3970
1       Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, that the test is an
2       objective one -- excuse me, an objective one under the D.C.
3       Circuit's ruling in Orloski.
4                We would seek to have Mr. Smith describe the facts
5       of Orloski a little bit so that the jury can understand what
6       it means to have an objective test for the concept of "For
7       The Purpose of Influencing an Election."
8                And then describe the -- then you are relating to
9       the Congressman Jim Moran 5141 that's cited in our papers,
10       again, describing some facts, to give the jury a sense of a
11       situation where the FEC has applied that term and how they

16                MR. BOVE:  Not hypotheticals, Judge.
17                Just the past decisions that are cited in our
18       request to charge.
19                So that's "For The Purpose of Influencing The
20       Election."
21                Next, I mentioned "The Irrespective Rule," which is
22       set out in the FEC's regulations and cited, I think, by both
23       parties in their request to charge.
24                It's at 11 CFR 113 -- I'm sorry.  .1(g).
25                And so, we seek to have Mr. Smith discuss that

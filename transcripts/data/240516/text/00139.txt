1 Q. So, if you see, this is just for you.
2 But, do you see the number, and that's you, then a
3 number that ends in 0594; do you see that?
4 A. Yes, sir.
5 Q. Do you see your text to this number that says, "This
6 number has been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and
7 continuous harassment to both myself as well as to the
8 organizations named on it?"
9 A. I do.
10 Q. That is at 7:10 p.m.; right?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. And then the text back says, "It wasn't me, my friend
13 told me to call, I am sorry for this, I won't do it again;"
14 right?
15 A. Yes, sir.
16 Q. Then you respond and said, "They're going to have to
17 explain that to the Secret Service," because you have been
18 receiving dozens of these harassing calls over the past three
19 days; right?
20 A. Correct.
21 Q. "If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent
22 or guardian;" that's what you said to them, right?
23 A. I did.
24 Q. The person texted you back and said, "I didn't do it, I
25 am 14, please don't do this."

4                  (Sidebar discussion continues: )
5                  MS. HOFFINGER:  We have additional objections at
6             this time, Judge.
7                THE COURT:  Do you want it to happen in open court?
8                MS. HOFFINGER:  I think I would rather that we
9       remain at sidebar, but unless your prefer to do it in open
10       court.
11                You can decide, once I explain --
12                THE COURT:  The press doesn't like it very much.
13                MS. HOFFINGER:  They will be able to read it later,
14       I would assume.
15                Your Honor, based on defense counsel's proposed
16       jury charges, we understand that they will likely be asking
17       Mr. Cohen today about Judge Furman's decision -- recent
18       decision in the Southern District of New York.
19                We understand that he may be able to inquire about
20       it, but we would object to the decision going in as being
21       extrinsic and collateral.
22                Also, we do think that if they go into that,
23       meaning Judge Furman's decision, not what he testified to,
24       that we would be, on redirect, seeking to admit Judge
25       Engoron's decision about that testimony.

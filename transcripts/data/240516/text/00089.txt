1 Q But maybe I am not being clear with my question. I
2 will try to be clearer.
3 Is it that you, when you made that statement, you were
4 speaking in the present sense, and so, it was a truthful
5 statement, or did you mean I wasn’t talking about myself, I was
6 talking about my lawyers?
7 A In the present sense.
8 Q So, it has nothing to do with whether you directed
9 your lawyers. You did direct your lawyers to explore the
10 possibility of a pardon, correct?
11 A I did.
12 Q And when you read a statement that says that you would
13 never accept a pardon, but you directed your lawyers to explore
14 the possibility, that’s not a true statement, is it?
15 A At that present moment it was true. I wanted this
16 nightmare to end. And so, with it being dangled, seeing it on
17 television, I asked them, is this really something that they
18 are talking about, can you find out.
19 Q And what I am trying to understand is, given what you
20 just said happened, what you wrote and then later said after
21 being put under oath, that you never did that?
22 A I am sorry. Can you repeat that.
23 Q You just gave a story that you wanted the nightmare to
24 end, right?
25 A Yes, sir.

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche

1       Q    And do you remember being asked the same question
2   about accepting a pardon and you saying that you directed your
3   lawyer to explore the possibility because you were a hundred
4   percent open to accepting it?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6       Q    And the lawyer -- there were a couple of lawyers that
7   you were talking about, right?
8            One was Mr. Ryan, who worked -- who was your lawyer
9   who worked with a law firm called McDermott, Will and Emery?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    And you spoke with her here named, Robert Costello
12   about that same issue, about exploring the possibility of a
13   pardon, correct?
14       A    I spoke to Mr. Costello about that as well.
15       Q    And in that deposition so, not the sworn testimony on
16   February 27th, but in that deposition, you said that, you
17   directed your lawyers to explore the possibility of a pardon
18   because the possibility was constantly being dangled in your
19   face, right?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    So, do you remember that right after you gave that
22   answer, the person who was questioning you asked you to
23   reconcile your testimony ten days earlier saying you never
24   asked for, nor would you ever accept a pardon and your
25   testimony at that deposition?

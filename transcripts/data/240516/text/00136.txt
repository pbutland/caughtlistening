1 MS. HOFFINGER: People versus Bornholdt.
2 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, that's not what this is
3 showing. They walked through every day and he talks about
4 what he remembers for each day.
5 As a matter of fact, on the 26th, which I am about
6 to show him, he has a specific recollection of telephone
7 calls with Trump.
8 On the 23rd to 25th there is a dash —— verbatim
9 writing of everything that he is saying. There is no
10 question and answer. It's just giving an explanation of
11 what he remembers.
12 MS. HOFFINGER: Which is exactly why he may have
13 not been asked the question.
14 THE COURT: That's why we have Bornholdt, to
15 ensure that people are not impeached simply because they
16 forgot to say something.
17 You have to establish that he was asked the
18 question. That he was directed to a particular area and
19 they failed to —— given the opportunity, they failed to
20 reveal it.
21 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court.)
22 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put back up to 255, just
23 for the witness, the parties, and the Court. Go to Page 8.

1            I didn't hear what you said.
2       A    I was talking about my appearance.
3       Q    Your appearance.  Got it.
4            Your appearance to be on his show?
5       A    Yes, sir.
6       Q    So, you now also have a specific recollection of a
7   conversation you had with Chris Cuomo eight years ago?
8       A    It was over an hour.  It was a very long conversation,
9   and, again, I recorded it as contemporaneous note-taking so
10   that I could pay attention to the conversation, and I could
11   ensure that the things that I brought up on his show were the
12   things that I wanted to say.
13            So I crafted my responses.
14       Q    And you remember that conversation today?
15       A    I remember having the conversation, yes.
16       Q    Do you -- I want to talk a minute about the recording
17   that you did surreptitiously with President Trump.
18            Now, that recording was about two minutes, 51 seconds,
19   right?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    And you didn't actually start talking until about a
22   minute into that recording, is that correct?
23       A    That's correct.
24       Q    And you were talking to President Trump at the time
25   about transferring information regarding our friend David,

1                 MR. BLANCHE:  If we can show the witness what's
2       marked for identification as B-127.  Just for the witness,
3       the Court and the parties.
4                      (Displayed.)
5       Q    Take a look at that, notes from a March 7, 2023,
6   interview.
7       A    Which bullet point, please?
8       Q    If you get to the third bullet, Mr. Cohen, you can
9   stop there.
10       A    Yes, sir.
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  You can take that down.
12                 Thank you.
13       Q    So, let me just re-ask my question.
14            When you testified that you believed that the story
15   would have a significant impact on the campaign, and my simple
16   question to you is that President Trump, at least initially,
17   didn't think it would hurt him, correct?
18       A    Initially, yes.
19       Q    Now, you also have testified, I am sorry, told the
20   Government that one of the things that President Trump was
21   worried about as it relates to this story was his family,
22   right?
23       A    Yes, sir.
24       Q    And his family meaning his wife but also his children,
25   correct?

1   day; right?
2       A.   You did.
3       Q.   And just to be clear, when you did those interviews,
4   the indictment was unsealed by the Court; correct?
5       A.   I had read it through the New York Times article.
6       Q.   But beyond that, if I suggested to you that you were
7   not supposed to talk about it on CNN, I want to make sure you
8   understand by the time you went on CNN it was public?
9       A.   Correct.
10                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, before lunch we had
11        offered B166 without redactions.  We now have redactions.
12                 THE COURT:  Thank you.
13                 MR. BLANCHE:  If we can put up B165, just for the
14        witness, the Court and the parties.
15       Q.   Mr. Cohen, you are looking at what we talked about
16   before lunch, which is a series of messages between you and an
17   unknown who says they're 14?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   The difference now is we applied redactions; correct?
20       A.   Correct.
21       Q.   Now, the number that you are communicating with is
22   0594, the rest is redacted?
23       A.   That is correct.
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  We offer B165.
25                 MS. HOFFINGER:  No objection.

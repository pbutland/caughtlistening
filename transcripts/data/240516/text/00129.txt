1   whole bunch of what they call, I think, phantom results, because
2   A.I. wants to please the user.

4   that were directly on point for why supervised release for me
5   under the circumstances was just improper.
6            And I provided it to him and he included it in the
7   document.
8            And those citations were inaccurate.  Not the sum and
9   substance, but the citations themselves.
10       Q.   When you say inaccurate, the cases just didn't exist;
11   correct?
12       A.   Under that specific citation, correct.
13       Q.   But that wasn't my question, about the specific
14   citation.
15            My question was:  The three cases that you gave to your
16   attorney were not real cases; correct?
17       A.   That's correct.
18       Q.   And you knew that your lawyer was going to use those
19   cases in support of your application; correct?
20       A.   I gave them to him to use in support of the
21   application, yes.
22       Q.   You were an attorney -- well, by that you were
23   disbarred?
24       A.   Yes, sir.
25       Q.   You were an attorney for over 30 years?

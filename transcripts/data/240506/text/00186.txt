2   much would The Trump Organization reimburse?
3       A.   One hundred dollars.
4       Q.   Now, you talked a little bit about invoices.  I want to
5   talk a little bit about who could sign checks, particularly for
6   the DJT account.
7            Who could sign checks for the DJT account in 2016 or

17       A.   It didn't matter.
18       Q.   With respect to approving invoices, was the ultimate

20       A.   Say that again.
21       Q.   That's okay.

23   an approved invoice mean that a check had to be signed?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   Could the person signing the check decide not to sign

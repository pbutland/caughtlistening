Proceedings
2256
1            MR. BOVE:  It's not an issue I created.
2            I just found out about the witness yesterday.
3            THE COURT:  And when you found out about it
4   yesterday, it's an issue I could have gone through
5   yesterday and this morning.
6            Now that the jury is here, we'll go through the
7   witness and the exhibits, and you will be given an
8   opportunity to make your objections one by one.
9            But, I don't think there's a reason for the
10   People to preclude the thumb drive.
11            MR. BOVE:  I'm not asking for a preclusion
12   remedy.
13            I'm asking for an opportunity to argue my
14   objections.
15            THE COURT:  You'll be given an opportunity to
16   argue your objections.
17            MR. BLANCHE:  Not for this witness.
18            Before the next witness, we would like to be
19   heard. We have an objection to the witness testifying.
20            THE COURT:  It doesn't have to be now?
21            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, your Honor.
22            THE COURT:  I'll hear you then.
23            Let's get the jury, please.
24            COURT OFFICER:  All rise.
25            Jury entering.

1       the trial.
2                 THE COURT:  Okay.
3                 MR. COLANGELO:  So, for the same reasons I
4       believe we briefed and argued previously, there is no
5       evidentiary inadmissibility doctrine for official acts.
6                 And, in any event, the regulations require the
7       filing of the OGE Form 278 for presidential candidates,
8       candidates for Federal office and Federal officials, for
9       reasons including for the purpose of ensuring compliance

18       don't know he laid a foundation for, including factual
19       foundations, or governmental official offices adopting the
20       form, on the first page.
21                 I don't think that can come in as a business
22       record.  I don't think as proffered right now, as a
23       business record, it can come in.
24                 MR. COLANGELO:  We are admitting this to show, or
25       offering this into evidence to show that this is a signed

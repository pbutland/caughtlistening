Proceedings
2416
1        one I am looking at was to Michael Cohen.  It goes to the
2        bank processing.  It gets cancelled at that point, and they
3        get it back.
4                 MR. CONROY:  Correct.
5                 MR. BLANCHE:  I don't know if that is true.  If
6        they laid the foundation that way -- but the checks are
7        already coming in separately.  This is the document from
8        Capital One.
9                 If your Honor looks at the first page of the
10        exhibit, there is all kinds of information stamped on this
11        check.  There are kinds of information that is typed,
12        presumably, by Capital One, not by The Trump Organization.
13                 If you move on to other checks, there is
14        information on these checks that I don't think this witness
15        can explain.
16                 For example, on the second page, it says something
17        totally different on the stamped check.  It says something
18        about Richmond, Virginia.  It has a signatory that isn't
19        Mr. Cohen.
20                 And the point is, the reason why you are supposed
21        to lay a foundation and have the witness testify about the
22        records and what they mean, as we heard this morning from
23        Mr. McConney, there needs to be enough foundation laid to
24        explain and justify the information on the check that is
25        hearsay to allow it into evidence for the truth.

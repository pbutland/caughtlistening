1       A.   Yes.
2       Q.   And part of the issue was that this was all new to the
3   Accounting Department; correct?
4       A.   Yes.
5       Q.   By "this," I mean trying to figure out how to pay
6   President Trump's personal expenses while he was in Washington
7   D.C.; right?
8       A.   Yes.
9       Q.   And so at the time you sent this email, it was not
10   clear to you how you could get President Trump to sign a check;
11   right?
12       A.   Correct.
13       Q.   And, so, based on conversations with others, your
14   understanding was that it should be paid from The Trust in order
15   to get around that practical issue; right?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   And that was all the thought that went into it;
18   correct?
19       A.   That is about it.
20       Q.   When somebody told you that President Trump could
21   actually sign checks from his personal account, you fixed the
22   procedure; right?
23       A.   I was told he should be paying through his personal
24   account.
25       Q.   And at that point all the payments after that were paid

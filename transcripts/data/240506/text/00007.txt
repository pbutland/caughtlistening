1   deal with it.
2            MR. BOVE:  It's very hard for me to do that on
3   the fly.
4            I still don't know what the exhibits are.
5            THE COURT:  How would it be any easier to do that
6   outside the presence of the jury?
7            MR. BOVE:  Because the Government would identify
8   which exhibits they're going to offer through the witness,
9   and I can go through the list we sent them over the
10   weekend of the objections.
11            THE COURT:  You sent them a list?
12            MR. BOVE:  Yes.
13            THE COURT:  So, you know the exhibits being
14   introduced contained within that list.
15            MR. BOVE:  Yes.
16            And I would like an opportunity to argue it
17   before your Honor, so you can rule.
18            THE COURT:  You can. We'll do it at sidebar.
19            MR. BOVE:  If there are 10 or 12 exhibits on this
20   list, it's not tenable for me to do it in real-time with
21   these things.
22            Would it not be more orderly to go through it one
23   by one?
24            THE COURT:  I don't want to keep the jury
25   waiting.

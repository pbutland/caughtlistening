1        the Court just said.  That is what The Trump Organization
2        does.
3                 Our objection is a little bit different.  While
4        they certainly need an invoice to pay and won't pay without
5        an invoice, the invoice itself that causes them to pay is
6        being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.
7        Meaning, the statements by Mr. Cohen in this case are being
8        offered as a business record exception to the hearsay rule.
9        That's our objection.
10                 The more meaningful objection -- it's not the same
11        as the one we raised this morning, from our understanding,
12        the People are going to offer People's Exhibit 42 through
13        this witness, who we believe is a Trump Organization
14        employee.  And it appears to us, unless we're wrong to be
15        Capital One Bank Records, and we very much object to that.
16                 I can walk through the information on this
17        exhibit -- that is, in theory, going to be offered for the
18        truth.  There is no way this witness can offer a business
19        record foundation for this.
20                 THE COURT:  Who is the witness?
21                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, the next witness is Deborah
22        Tarasoff, who works in the Accounts Payable Department.
23                 She will testify that this Exhibit 42 is a series
24        of cancelled checks, and it's routine for The Trump
25        Organization to get cancelled checks for all of its

1                 (Continued from the previous page:)
2       Q    I want to talk a little about 2017 before we start
3   looking at the records.
4       In 2017, after Mr. Trump became the President, did anything
5   change with respect to how checks were signed for the DJT
6   account?
7       A    No.
8       Q    In other words, he had to sign all the personal
9   checks, still?
10       A    From his personal account, yes.
11       Q    But, he was not in New York anymore; correct?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    So, how would that happen?
14       A    We would send them to the White House for him to sign.
15       Q    So, even when he was in D.C., no one else had
16   authority to sign those checks?
17       A    That's right.
18       Q    Did you prepare the checks for signature the same way
19   that you always have?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Do you know how the checks were sent to D.C.?
22       A    By Federal Express.
23       Q    If you know, who did that at The Trump Organization?
24       A    I think, at the time, Rebecca Manochio did.
25       Q    How did she get the checks?

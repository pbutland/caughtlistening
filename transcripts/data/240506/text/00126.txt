1 highlight there.
2 Mr. McConney, can you read what that line says?
3 A Sure.
4 In the interest of transparency, while not required to
5 be disclosed as reportable liabilities on Part 8, in 2016,
6 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump’s attorneys,
7 Michael Cohen.
8 Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and
9 Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017.
10 The category of value would be $100,001 to $250,000
11 and the interest rate would be zero.
12 Q Let me ask you a question about the category of value.
13 In your work on the Financial Disclosure Report, this
14 278E Form, do you have an understanding of how liabilities are
15 required to be disclosed?
16 A Yes.
17 Q What is that understanding?
18 A They are reported within a range of a certain point
19 and anything within that range.
20 Q Okay.
21 So a filer is not required to report a specific dollar
22 amount, but instead is required to disclose the dollar value
23 range of a given liability, is that right?
24 A Well, the range that that dollar amount would fall
25 into.

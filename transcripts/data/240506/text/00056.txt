2 And underneath that, "Start 35,000 per month January 2017,
3 Mike to invoice us."
4 Q So did these notes refer to the same reimbursement as
5 the handwritten notes on the First Republic Bank statement that
6 we just discussed?
7 A Yes.
8 Q What does "pay through January 20th" —— which you
9 started to say changed to "through January 27th" —— what does
10 that mean?
11 A January 27th, I’m assuming, was the end of a payroll
12 week.
13 So that’s when I was originally told to take Michael off
14 payroll, that one was changed to January 27th; so that’s the
15 last day he was to be paid.
16 Q And that’s the last day he was paid as an employee of
17 the Trump Organization?
18 A Yes. I’m sorry. As an employee, yes.
19 Q And below that, you said the next line down reads
20 "Bonus $50,000;" right?
21 A Yes.
22 Q And Mr. Weisselberg’s notes said the additional bonus
23 was $60,000; is that right?
24 A Yes.
25 Q What accounts for the difference?

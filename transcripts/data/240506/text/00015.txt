1       Q    Is there an entity that holds The Trump Organization's
2   assets?
3       A    Well, each entity -- the way we set everything up is
4   each asset was owned by a separate entity and, sometimes,
5   multiple entities.
6       So, Trump Tower would have been owned by an entity, Trump
7   Commercial LLC, and may have had a few members in that entity.
8       And -- does that answer your question?
9       Q    Yes.
10       Do all those entities roll up, ultimately, to -- I think
11   you mentioned "The Trust" a minute ago.
12       Do they all roll up to The Trust?
13       A    Yes. That's the ultimate owner.
14       Q    Who is the official owner, officially, of The Trust?
15       A    President Trump.
16                 MR. COLANGELO: Please display for the witness,
17        the Court, and Counsel, a document marked for
18        identification as People's 86.
19                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the
20        aforementioned parties' screens.)
21       Q    Let me know if you see that on your screen,
22   Mr. McConney.
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Do you recognize this document?
25       A    Yes.

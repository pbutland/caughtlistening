2 Getting back to your Honor's question about
3 Ms. Longstreet.
4 We called her on Friday.
5 As you remember, and let me just first say that, of
6 course, the Court has inherent authority to control the
7 order and the mechanics of witness examination during the
8 trial.
9 As you know, we learned Thursday that a juror had a
10 medical appointment or issue that required early departure
11 on Friday.
12 There were certain aspects of Ms. Longstreet's
13 testimony that needed to come in before Hope Hicks could
14 testify.
15 And so, we called her and truncated her direct
16 examination so that we could get her off the stand and get
17 Ms. Hicks on the stand so that we could, hopefully, finish
18 her and not have to get her back today, because the juror
19 had to leave.
20 And as you recall, we timed that pretty closely.
21 I think we ended on Friday at 3:30, and the juror
22 had to leave sometime between 3:30 and 3:45.
23 So, shortly after, we discussed Ms. Longstreet. We
24 notified —— we put on the record at a bench conference that
25 we intended to recall her.

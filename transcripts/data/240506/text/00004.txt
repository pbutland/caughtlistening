Proceedings
2252
1            THE COURT:  Not at all.
2            I believe there was no objection from the
3   Defense.
4            MR. BOVE:  Not at all.
5            THE COURT:  I'll do that first thing.
6            MR. BOVE:  There are a number of exhibits we
7   expect the People to offer through the next witness, who
8   we expect to be Jeff McConney.
9            We ask for an opportunity to express our
10   objections outside the presence of the jury.
11            It's very difficult. The People will hand
12   Mr. McConney a thumb drive with a large number of exhibits
13   contained on it.
14            We prefer the Court to look at them one by one
15   beforehand.
16            THE COURT:  How many exhibits are we talking
17   about?
18            MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, the People intend to
19   admit about 26 exhibits through Mr. McConney.
20            THE COURT:  Why wasn't this brought to my
21   attention sooner? I could have been looking at them over
22   the weekend or this morning.
23            MR. BOVE:  I wish, also, we were notified sooner.
24            The Government notified us of this yesterday
25   afternoon, that Mr. McConney would be taking the stand,

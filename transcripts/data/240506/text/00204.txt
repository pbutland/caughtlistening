1   two lines?
2       A    "Two signatures needed on amounts over $10,000."

4       A    $70,000.
5       Q    And what's the check number?

7       Q    Now, do you recognize the two signatures there?
8       A    Yes, I do.
9       Q    Whose signatures are those?
10       A    The top one is Eric, and the bottom one is Allen

20   photocopy it, that's what happens?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Okay.
23                 MR. CONROY:    Now, I just want to -- you could
24        take the check itself down.
25       Q    We talked a little bit earlier about how you would

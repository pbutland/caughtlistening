2       Q    You mentioned a few times that you took notes during a
3   conversation you had with Mr. Weisselberg about these
4   repayments; is that right?
5       A    Yes.
6                  MR. COLANGELO:  Let's display People's 36 in
7        evidence.
8                  (Displayed.)
9       Q    Starting at the top of this document.
10       What is this?
11       A    This is the notes I was taking when Allen was talking
12   to me and explaining to me what we owed Michael and how we were
13   going to pay him.
14       Q    And what is this piece of paper that you were writing
15   on?
16       A    I'm not sure I understand your question.  It was a note
17   pad.
18       Q    That answers my question.
19       A    Okay.
20       Q    And did you -- can you describe to the jury the
21   circumstances when you wrote down these notes?
22       A    This was during the first meeting that -- when I found
23   out that we owed Michael money.
24       Me and Allen -- Allen threw a pad on the desk and said "just
25   take notes."

1       A    Usually, we tried to get an invoice for any wire
2   transfer check.
3       Q    You mentioned that Ms. Tarasoff, generally, handled
4   that process.
5       Is that because she is the Accounts Payable Supervisor?
6       A    She is the Accounts Payable Department.
7       Q    She is the Department?
8       A    As of this point and when I left, she was the only one
9   left in Accounts Payable.
10       Q    Must an invoice be approved before a check is cut?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Who has authority to approve invoices?
13       A    President Trump when -- before he became President.
14   Allen Weisselberg. Donald Trump, Junior.  Eric Trump.  When
15   Ivanka Trump was working for us, Ivanka Trump.  Allen
16   Weisselberg.  Matthew Calamari.  Those were the general
17   approvers.
18       Q    Did you have authority to approve any invoices?
19       A    No.
20       Q    In the instances when you were going to
21   Mr. Weisselberg to pay, how did you request approval?
22       A    When I had a piece of paper -- I'm an old-timer, I
23   like pieces of paper -- I would bring it to Allen Weisselberg,
24   ask him to approve it.
25       If it came via email, I would forward the email and ask him

4        generated by Capital One, were produced by The Trump
5        Organization from their records.
6                 THE COURT:  Is that what you are referring to?

20                 MR. CONROY:  Yes.
21                 THE COURT:  So, these were checks that were cut by
22        a Trump Organization employee; right?
23                 MR. CONROY:  Yes.
24                 THE COURT:  Trump Organization Revocable Trust,

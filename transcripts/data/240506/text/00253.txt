1 But, if you look at the cases, to the extent that
2 there are cases on this issue, the reasons given for
3 recalling a witness, at least that I have found, do not
4 include a summary witness who they call just to get some
5 stuff in, not tell anybody they're going to recall them, and
6 then after the witness leaves, the stand and say: Oh, we're
7 going to recall her.
8 THE COURT: Let me ask you, what's the prejudice
9 to you?
10 MR. BLANCHE: The cross itself is the prejudice,
11 your Honor.
12 We crossed the witness and said —— and asked her
13 about all —— like I just said, it turns out that was totally
14 wrong, it turns out that there are more exhibits that she
15 was asked to offer and admit into evidence.
16 And, again, she's doing this as an employee of the
17 District Attorney's Office, not as a custodian of X or Truth
18 Social.
19 THE COURT: I'm not really following.
20 If she takes the stand and she testifies as to
21 additional Tweets and Truths and it's a summary witness for
22 Exhibit 171A, what is the prejudice to the defendant?
23 MR. BLANCHE: The cross—examination of her on
24 Friday included, in part, your Honor, the fact that she was
25 only being asked about seven to nine, after reviewing

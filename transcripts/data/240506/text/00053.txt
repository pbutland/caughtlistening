1 $60,000;" right?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Did you discuss this additional bonus with
4 Mr. Weisselberg?
5 A No. On my sheet I wrote down $50,000, which is
6 incorrect, but I just, whatever, that's what Allen told me. I
7 didn't really discuss it with him.
8 Q Did you have an understanding that the payment was to
9 include an additional bonus?
10 A Yes. Michael was complaining that he —— his bonus
ll wasn't large enough for the prior year so this was, I guess, to
12 make up for whatever he thought he was owed.
13 Q And did those amounts then total $420,000?
14 A Yes.
15 Q And you said Mr. Weisselberg's notes then show that
16 total being divided by 12 to equal $35,000 per month; correct?
17 A Yes.
18 Q Did he explain to you what that meant?
19 A That was just math.
20 Q Did you have an understanding as to how the payments
21 were going to be made?
22 A Yes.
23 Q What was that understanding?
24 A At that point in time, we were going to send a wire
25 transfer to Michael for $35,000 per month, starting February lst

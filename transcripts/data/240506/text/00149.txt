2       Q.   Now, I think you said you don't have a specific
3   recollection of when Mr. Weisselberg handed you this document?
4       A.   Correct.
5       Q.   You don't have a specific recollection of the
6   conversation around the document; right?
7       A.   Correct.
8       Q.   And it sounds like, basically, your present memory is
9   that you understood you were supposed to keep track of this
10   piece of paper that he handed you; right?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Now, on direct, you sort of offered an interpretation
13   of the words "gross up;" do you remember that?
14       A.   I don't remember the exact wording, but it sounds
15   right.
16       Q.   I am referring to the entry on the page, I think you
17   said -- I think you said it reads "gross up two?"
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   But you don't know exactly what Weisselberg meant by
20   that; do you?
21       A.   No, nobody would know.
22       Q.   The idea to double the payment to make sure that Cohen
23   got $180,000 after taxes, that doesn't make a lot of sense; does
24   it?
25       A.   No.

2       Q    What does "accounts receivable" mean?
3       A    "Accounts receivable" is the other side, when somebody
4   owes you money.
5       Q    You mentioned that one of your functions as Controller
6   was overseeing the General Ledger; is that right?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    What is a General Ledger?
9       A    General -- there are two books of original entry in
10   accounting. You have cash receipts, the money you receive, and
11   cash disbursements, the money you spend.
12       The General Ledger puts that information together. The
13   information is posted by the General Ledger accounts' receipts,
14   so you can see different types of expenses, payroll, gas,
15   electric, how much you're spending at a different point in
16   time.
17       Q    Does the General Ledger keep track of all the
18   interactions the General Ledger makes?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    You mentioned the term "cash receipts".
21       Does that include money coming in?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    You also mentioned "cash disbursements".
24       Does that mean money going out?
25       A    Yes.

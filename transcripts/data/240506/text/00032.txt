1 He said, "Now focus on my bills."
2 It was a teaching moment. Just because somebody is asking
3 for money, negotiate with them, talk to them. Just don't do it
4 mindlessly. Think before you do it.
5 Q Are you familiar with a process by which The Trump
6 Organization accounting staff cuts checks?
7 A Yes.
8 Q Describe that process, generally, please.
9 A An approved invoice is received. Deb would stamp it
10 with her stamp. She would put a code on it. I believe she puts
11 a dollar amount on the voucher, or when she puts it in the
12 system, it creates a voucher. She would put a voucher number on
13 it. So, the voucher is in the Multi Data System.
14 When she was ready to pay it, she would select a voucher,
15 and we would print the check on the checks that we had. She
16 would attach a check to the invoice and give it to the person
17 who’s the signatory on the account, the check would be signed,
18 and then she mailed them out.
19 Q You mentioned someone named "Deb".
20 Is that Deb Tarasoff you mentioned before?
21 A Deb Tarasoff.
22 Q As a matter of course, did The Trump Organization ever
23 cut a check if no invoice was submitted?
24 A Of course not.
25 Q Is that true from checks cut from The Trust account?

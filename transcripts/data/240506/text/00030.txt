1 We would receive reports from the outside properties, the
2 golf courses and the hotels, to see what their cash balance
3 was, and they would do a projection for us of how much they
4 needed for the week and how much they expected to receive for
5 the week. Someone would put this together and see if an entity
6 had money to spend or excess money to distribute.
7 For example, if a rental property like Trump Tower had
8 rental receipts that could distribute money to the owner, and
9 if there was another project going on at the golf course, we
10 could then fund that entity.
11 Q How often did the Accounting Department, sort of,
12 prepare that cash acquisition analysis?
13 A This was done on a weekly basis.
14 Q So, if an entity had excess funds to distribute, where
15 would it be distributed to?
16 A It would be distributed to the owner.
17 Q With the owner, here, being the DJT account?
18 A Prior to June 20th, it was the Donald J. Trump
19 personal account.
20 After June 20th, it should have been the Donald J. Trump
21 Revocable Trust.
22 Q When you say "June 20th", do you mean January 20th?
23 A Sorry.
24 January 20, 2017.
25 Q If an entity needed money before January 20, 2017,

1   complicated once he left The Trump Organization; correct?
2       A.   What was more complicated?
3       Q.   How to pay the bonus, it wasn't as simple as just
4   routing through payroll anymore, he didn't work there anymore?
5       A.   Right.
6                 MR. BOVE:  We can take that down.
7       Q.   Now, you testified on direct examination that you kept
8   these two documents, Government Exhibits 35 and 36, your notes
9   and the bank statement in the payroll book; right?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   In a cabinet in your office; right?
12       A.   Locked in my office.
13       Q.   A cabinet that you locked; right?
14       A.   Yes, sir.
15       Q.   And the reason that that cabinet was locked was because
16   the payroll book contained a lot of sensitive information;
17   right?
18       A.   It was a drawer with other payroll information, not
19   just that book.
20       Q.   It's not that these notes were particularly sensitive,
21   it's that the payroll book contained personal identifying
22   information relating to the thousands of employees; right?
23       A.   Well, technically, just employees that I was paying
24   through Trump Payroll Corp.  It was weekly reports,
25   terminations, a lot of employee payroll information.

5       Q    What is this document?

10                 MR. COLANGELO:  I offer People's 54 in evidence.
11                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
12                 THE COURT:  Approach.
13                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
14                 record.)
15                 MR. BOVE:  Your Honor, as far as I can tell,
16       Government Exhibit 54 relates to a period from 2018
17       forward.  If that's correct, we don't see the relevance of
18       those entries in this case.
19                 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, People's 54 is an
20       extract from the General Ledger for the Revocable Trust
21       Account that shows all payments made, coded to the Legal
22       Expense Code.
23                 The relevance is that there are no payments to
24       Michael Cohen, Esquire from The Trust account for 2018 that
25       were coded to 51505.

Proceedings

1   have to consider a jail sanction if recommended.
2            Mr. Trump, it's important to understand that the
3   last thing I want to do is to put you in jail.
4            You are the former President of the United States
5   and possibly the next President, as well.
6            There are many reasons why incarceration is truly
7   a last resort for me. To take that step would be
8   disruptive to these proceedings, which I imagine you want
9   to end as quickly as possible.
10            I also worry about the people who would have to
11   execute that sanction: the court officers, the correction
12   officers, the Secret Service detail, among others. I worry
13   about them and about what would go into executing such a
14   sanction.
15            Of course, I'm also aware of the broader
16   implications of such a sanction. The magnitude of such a
17   decision is not one-sided.
18            But, at the end of the day, I have a job to do,
19   and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the
20   judicial system and compel respect.
21            Your continued violations of this Court's lawful
22   Order threaten to interfere with the administration of
23   justice in constant attacks which constitute a direct
24   attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to
25   continue.

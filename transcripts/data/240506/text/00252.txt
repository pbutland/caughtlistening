Proceedings
2500
1                And so, the point was that when they told us
2       included on the witness list was a custodian from the X
3       Corp, and a custodian from Truth Social -- so, when we
4       learned that she was going to be testifying and getting
5       those exhibits in, as your Honor knows, we objected, and we
6       prepared a cross based upon our understanding of what she
7       was going to be allowed to admit.
8                We didn't know, like I said, her name until
9       Wednesday afternoon.
10                We then performed the cross, assuming those were
11       the exhibits she was going to offer.
12                As the Court is aware, part of the cross was that,
13       I think the point was that of the however many thousands of
14       social media posts she was tasked with reviewing, the
15       witness testified to only seven or nine, whatever the
16       numbers were that she was asked to identify and admitted in
17       evidence.
18                I did not know at the time, because no one told us
19       what was just said today, was that there was timing and
20       scheduling issues and so they only intended to call this
21       witness to get a few exhibits in and then they intended to
22       recall her.
23                That's not the way it's supposed to work.
24                And I agree with the People that it's absolutely
25       within your discretion under the rules, under Rule 107.

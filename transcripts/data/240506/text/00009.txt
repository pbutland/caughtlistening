3                 THE CLERK:  Do both sides stipulate that all
4        jurors are present and properly seated?
5                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
6                 THE COURT:  Good morning, jurors. Welcome back.
7                 I hope you had a good weekend.
8                 Jurors, before we call our first witness of the
9        day, I want to give you certain instructions.

11        into evidence, but some material is what we call
12        "redacted".
13                 These redactions were made to remove personal
14        identifying information and assure that only relevant
15        admissible evidence is put before you.
16                 You may not speculate as to what material has
17        been redacted, and you may not draw any inference, either
18        favorable or unfavorable to either party, with respect to
19        certain information being redacted.
20                 You may call your witness.

22                 COURT OFFICER:  Witness entering.

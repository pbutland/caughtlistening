1                 There is a lot of information on this check that I
2        don't think this witness can explain.
3                 Now, the checks are coming into evidence
4        themselves.  Of course, we're not objecting to those.
5                 THE COURT:  So the checks are coming into
6        evidence.
7                 You have a problem with the cancelled checks
8        coming into evidence?
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  I have a problem with Exhibit 42,
10        which is a bank record, we believe from Capital One, being
11        offered as an exception to the hearsay rule by a Trump
12        Organization witness.
13                 THE COURT:  I don't have a problem with it.  It's
14        a cancelled check.  It's the same check that Ms. Tarasoff
15        presumably generated herself and actually paid out.  I
16        think that she is certainly capable of testifying that this
17        was standard business practices, that they would receive
18        these cancelled checks every month or every six weeks,
19        whatever.
20                 It could come in as business record.  It could
21        even possibly come in as real evidence.
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, I do not object.  We do
23        not question that she can testify to most of what you just
24        said.  Which is, she would receive these in the regular
25        course.

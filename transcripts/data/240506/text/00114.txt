9   a 1099?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    What's a 1099?
12       A    There are various types of 1099s.  You get 1099s from
13   banks for savings account for interest.  You get them from
14   brokerage accounts for dividends.  Non-employees get a 1099
15   miscellaneous.
16            There are a number of 1099s that can be issued for
17   various reasons.
18       Q    Did part of your responsibilities as controller of the
19   Trump Organization include overseeing the preparation of 1099s?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    How were 1099s generated?
22       A    If the checks were issued from MDS, there is a program
23   in MDS that would literally issue 1099 forms or print the 1099
24   form.  And we can just make them out and send them to the
25   company.

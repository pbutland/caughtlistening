1       A    No idea.
2       Q    And you don't know whether Mr. Cohen did legal work in
3   2017 for members of President Trump's family, correct?
4                 MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
5                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
6       Q    Mr. Bernik, can you publish Government's Exhibit 37-K,
7   and if we can zoom in on the 9:31 a.m. email.
8            So this is an email that -- it's an email thread that
9   you testified about earlier.  This message is from Michael
10   Cohen to Allen Weisselberg.
11            Do you see that?
12       A    Yes, sir.
13       Q    And do you see where it says, please call me to
14   discuss the last open foundation matter?
15       A    Yes, sir.
16       Q    And so, does this suggest to you that in 2017 there
17   was an open matter that Michael Cohen was handling?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    We can take that down.  Thank you.
20            Now, I think you said before that January 2017, was a
21   period of flux and chaos at the Trump Organization?
22       A    That's putting it mildly.
23       Q    And that's because President Trump had become
24   President of the United States, right?
25       A    Yes, sir.

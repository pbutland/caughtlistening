1 know if it refreshes your recollection about public disclosure
2 relating to The Trust structure.
3 MR. COLANGELO: Objection, your Honor.
4 May we approach?
5 THE COURT: Sure.
6 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
7 record.)
8 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor.
9 First of all, to the extent this is intended to
10 refresh his recollection, he didn’t say —— no foundation
11 has been laid.
12 He didn't say that he might know and needs to be
13 refreshed. He said he had no idea.
14 Second, the attempt to offer this document —— for
15 this document to be offered as testimony or argument from
16 counsel on cross, or cross—examination, on anything other
17 than refreshing his recollection, this appears to be an
18 exhibit, or an attempt to admit an exhibit that the Court
19 already excluded for failure to disclose after months of
20 requesting exhibits.
21 MR. BOVE: If we can have the answer read back.
22 I thought he did.
23 THE COURT: Can you read it back?
24 (Whereupon, the requested testimony was read
25 back by the reporter.)

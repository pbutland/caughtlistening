9   Accounts Payable for that account as well?

11       Q.   And do you handle Accounts Payable for that account the

15       Q.   Do you recall when you started handling the DJT
16   Revocable Trust Account?

18       Q.   Was that when he became President in 2017?
19       A.   I don't recall when it came into effect.
20       Q.   Do you recall if there was a specific requirement that
21   two people sign checks over $10,000 for the Revocable Trust?
22       A.   There was a time, yes.
23       Q.   And going now, we talked a little bit about the DJT
24   account.  Once Mr. Trump became President, did he still sign all
25   the checks for that account?

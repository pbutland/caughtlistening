2 THE COURT: Yes, Mr. Bove?
3 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.
4 This is an email that we would present as an
5 example of the embedded hearsay issue.
6 And there are a couple of messages from Cohen on
7 this thread that we object to coming in on the business
8 records foundation.
9 There has to be some other basis for their
10 admissibility.
11 To the extent they're not being offered for their
12 truth, we would ask for a limiting instruction that makes
13 that clear to the jury.
14 And so, I am specifically referring to the Cohen
15 email at 7:59 a.m. And then the email invoice that he sends
16 at 11:58 a.m.
17 Those are factual assertions by Mr. Cohen.
18 THE COURT: Can you read it to me?
19 Can you read to me what you believe the embedded
20 hearsay is?
21 MR. BOVE: Yes. The 7:59 a.m. email of —— this is
22 an email from Mr. Cohen to the witness.
23 It says: "Jeff, sorry for the delay. And thank
24 you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks for
25 January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen,

1   Trump Organization, include helping to prepare an Annual
2   Financial Disclosure Report for Mr. Trump to be submitted to
3   the Office of Government Ethics?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    Did you have a name for that Annual Financial
6   Disclosure Report?
7       A    We called -- we used to call it by the form number.
8            It was 278E, as in Edward.
9       Q    Can you describe what the form 278E is?
10       A    It -- it is a filing -- it's what's called a Conflict
11   of Interest Form that the Government requires certain
12   individuals to file annually, semi-annually.
13            I am not too sure of other reports, but the President
14   had to file this form annually.
15       Q    Did he file it both when he was a candidate for
16   presidency and as President?
17       A    He -- we filed reports from -- when he declared his
18   candidacy in 2015 until when he left office in 2017.
19            He is a candidate now.  I am not there, so I don't
20   know if he filed anything.
21       Q    During your time at the Trump Organization, did you
22   work on the Form 278E before Mr. Trump became President?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    What kinds of financial interests are required to be
25   disclosed on the Office of Government Ethics Form 278E?

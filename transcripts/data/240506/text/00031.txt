15       Q    Can you describe that for the jury, please?
16       A    Early on, I think I was employed for about a year,
17   President Trump was on the phone. I walked into his office,
18   dropped a report on his desk, turned around.
19       And he said, "Jeff, hold on a minute" -- sorry.  He said to
20   who he was talking to, the person on the phone, "Hold on a
21   minute," and turned around and said, "Jeff, you're fired," and
22   started talking to the person on the phone again.
23       I stood there until he got off the phone call.
24       And he said, "You're not fired, but my cash balances went
25   down from last week."  He said, "I know you negotiated this."

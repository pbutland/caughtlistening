D. Tarasoff — Cross/Mr. Blanche
2490
1 A Correct.
2 Q And did you and your boss —— it sounded like they
3 varied a little bit, but in 2016 and 2017, it was Mr. McConney?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Mr. Weisselberg?
6 A Yes.
7 Q And so, when we saw the back and forth with the emails
8 a few minutes ago, where Mr. McConney would say, Hey, "Deb,
9 please pay," that was what happened all the time; correct?
10 A Yes.
11 Q And the same thing at times with Mr. Weisselberg?
12 A Yes.
13 Q So, you didn't have authority to cut a check on your
14 own; correct?
15 A Correct.
16 Q So —— but, is it fair to say that when you testified,
17 that you believed or you thought that Mr. Weisselberg and
18 President Trump talked a lot, you weren't present for those
19 conversations; right?
20 A Right.
21 Q So, when Mr. Weisselberg, on some of the emails that we
22 saw or Mr. McConney told you to go ahead and pay it, generate a
23 check, you didn't get permission from President Trump himself;
24 correct?
25 A Correct.

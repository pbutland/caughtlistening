J. McConnell — Direct/Colangelo
2303
1 And Allen started rattling off stuff, some of which I wrote
2 directly, some of which I did not.
3 Q Can you please read out loud the handwritten text
4 starting at the top?
5 A The top starts with, "Michael Cohen. Pay through
6 January 20th, 2017."
7 That was the original line.
8 The 20th was crossed out and replaced by 27th, which would
9 be the day I took him off, or the last day I would pay him
10 through.
11 Then it says, "bonus 50,000. Then 180,000. 180,000 times
12 two for taxes."
13 The original number I had was just the 50,000 and the 180,
14 and that's where the 230 comes from.
15 The 230 is crossed out.
16 And then I —— when I add the second 180,000, I come up with
17 a total of 410,000.
18 Then he said, "Use 420," because I was possibly rattling
19 the numbers back to Allen and he said: "No, no, the number is
20 420."
21 Instead of figuring out what I did write, I wrote "420."
22 So I used 420 and I divided it by 12 —— by 12 so that's
23 35,000 per month effective 2/1/17, which was 2017.
24 We were to wire the funds monthly from Mr. Trump's ——
25 President Trump's personal account, which was used to wire money

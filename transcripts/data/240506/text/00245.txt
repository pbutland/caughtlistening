Proceedings
2493
1 was a witness, and we were given a certain number of
2 exhibits that she was going to be offering.
3 We, obviously, spent time preparing not only
4 objections, but we were also preparing for cross.
5 She testified on Friday morning. We crossed her.
6 She admitted exhibits. And then at the next sidebar, they
7 said: We're going to recall her.
8 The rules don't allow for that.
9 I mean, it's discretionary to recall a witness, of
10 course, but it can't just be that we can put a witness on,
11 have us cross her, prepare a witness ——
12 THE COURT: We can excuse the jury for the day, and
13 we can talk about this.
14 I will excuse the jury for the day, and we can talk
15 about it.
16 MR. BLANCHE: All right.
17 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay.
18 (Sidebar concluded.)

20 THE COURT: Jurors, we are going to stop a little
21 bit early today.
22 As I excuse you, I will ask you:
23 Please do not talk, either among yourselves or with
24 anyone else, about anything related to the case.
25 Please continue to keep an open mind.

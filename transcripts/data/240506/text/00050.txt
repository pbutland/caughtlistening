1       Do you recognize that handwriting?
2       A    Yes.
3       That's Allen Weisselberg's handwriting.
4       Q    Can you please read what Mr. Weisselberg wrote on the
5   bank statement?
6       A    Starts at the top. "$180,000." It's underlined.
7   "Grossed up to $360,000. Add additional bonus, $60,000." The
8   two amounts are added together for "$420,000". Then he divides
9   it by -- that's at 12, which equals off to the right, that's
10   "$35,000 per/month effective 2/1/17."
11       Q    So, I would like to make sure the jury understands
12   each of the numbers in that equation, starting with the
13   $180,000 figure.
14       Where does the $180,000 figure in Mr. Weisselberg's notes
15   come from?
16       A    If you pull out and scroll up to the right. It's a
17   combination of two amounts.
18       Q    Can we show the entire bottom part of this document?
19       A    So, it's a total of the domestic wire transfer for
20   $130,000, plus the $50,000 paid to Red Finch for tech services.

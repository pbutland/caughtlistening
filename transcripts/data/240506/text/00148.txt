5       Q.   Now, I would like to direct your attention to the line
6   that says "X2 for taxes;" do you see that?
7       A.   Yes.
8       Q.   I think you testified previously that you don't have a
9   specific recollection of what Weisselberg told you that meant;
10   right?
11       A.   Right.  He was just rattling off information I had to
12   write down.
13       Q.   You were taking notes and just writing down what he
14   said?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And this was his idea, right?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   And you don't know where the idea came from, correct?
19       A.   No, I don't.
20       Q.   Mr. Weisselberg had a lot of different experiences, but
21   he was not a tax accountant; correct?
22       A.   He was not a tax accountant.
23       Q.   Now, let's take a look at the document that
24   Mr. Weisselberg handed you, Government Exhibit 35, please.

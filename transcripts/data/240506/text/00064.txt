l of the invoices by email and incorporating it into The Trump
2 Organization and relying on them for Trump Organization

5 records exception and the coconspirator exception.
6 THE COURT: And you are not asking for any limiting
7 instruction?
8 MR. COLANGELO: No, your Honor. I don't think any
9 limited instruction is appropriate.
10 THE COURT: Okay.
11 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, as to the 7:59 a.m.
12 email, you know, I would make the same argument.
13 There is an initial request for payment.
14 Mr. Cohen, you can tell from email context, was responding
15 to Mr. McConney's request for an invoice.
16 Mr. McConney will testify that he then followed up
17 to say that that wasn't enough for an invoice, but it was
18 part of the process for requesting and accepting/receiving
19 payment.
20 THE COURT: Unlike the situation that came up
21 previously where the People were offering certain emails
22 into evidence as business records —— oh, actually, I think
23 there was an exception.
24 In any event, I find that these are business
25 records.

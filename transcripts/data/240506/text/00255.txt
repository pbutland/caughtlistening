1       they were only going to use this witness to get in enough
2       exhibits to get them through Friday.
3                If they would have said that to us, which they
4       should have if that was their case, we could have adjusted
5       our cross accordingly.
6                I -- again, it matters.
7                We don't have any idea who the witness is tomorrow.
8       We still don't know.
9                We found out about this witness, found out her name
10       on Wednesday.
11                THE COURT:  Right.
12                When do you intend to call Ms. Longstreet?
13                MR. STEINGLASS:  Well, we could have done it this
14       afternoon, but I think we should start with a new witness
15       who we will -- we have been, as a matter of courtesy -- we
16       were ordered not to provide counsel with the name of the
17       witnesses for the next day until the next afternoon.
18                I'll do so as soon as we are off the record, give
19       the name for the witness for tomorrow.
20                I think -- I don't think we will get to
21       Ms. Longstreet until Thursday or Friday.
22                THE COURT:  All right.  Well, I would like you to
23       give the defense 24 hours notice before you call
24       Ms. Longstreet.
25                MR. STEINGLASS:  We can do that.

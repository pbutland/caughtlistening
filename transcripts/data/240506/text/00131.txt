1       Q    And as far as you know, President Trump did not ask
2   anyone to do those things, correct?
3                 MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
4                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
5       Q    I am just asking about your knowledge.
6       A    Okay.  So can you ask it again?
7       Q    I can't ask it again.  Sorry.
8            I just want to focus, though, my questions to about
9   what you knew.
10       A    Okay.
11       Q    In none of the conversations that you had with
12   Mr. Weisselberg did he suggest that President Trump had told
13   him to do these things?
14       A    Allen never told me that.
15       Q    And you testified about some emails that you have
16   exchanged with Michael Cohen, right?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And it seems like the bulk of those were in 2017,
19   correct?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    You did not actually talk to Mr. Michael Cohen about
22   any of these issues, did you?
23                 MR. COLANGELO:  Objection.
24                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
25       A    No.  Talked to Michael, no.

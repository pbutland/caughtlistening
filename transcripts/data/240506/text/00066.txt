8 MR. COLANGELO: And if we could have that displayed
9 and zoomed in, if that's possible.
10 Thank you.
11 Q Can you read that message, please?
12 A "Just a reminder to get me the invoice you spoke to
13 Allen about. Thanks, Jeff."
14 Q Does that appear to be the same message that we just
15 discussed where you e—mailed Mr. Cohen on February 6th?
16 A I believe so, yes.
17 Q Looking just above that message. What does the next
18 message show?
19 A It's an email from Michael: "Jeff, sorry for the delay
20 and thank you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks
21 for January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen,
22 Esquire, and sent to.... hope you are well and see you soon."
23 Q And directing your attention to the next message just
24 above that.
25 Can you read out loud your response to Mr. Cohen?

Senior Court Reporter

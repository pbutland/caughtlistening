Proceedings
2251
1            So, as much as I do not want to impose a jail
2   sanction, and I have done everything I can to avoid doing
3   so, I want you to understand that I will, if necessary and
4   appropriate.
5            Do the attorneys have any other questions about
6   that?
7            I will now hand down the decision from the Court.
8            This is for the Defense, and this is for the
9   People.
10            (Whereupon, the sergeant gives copies of the
11   Court's decision to the parties.)
12            THE COURT:  You can call the trial.
13            THE CLERK:  This is People of the State of New
14   York against Donald J. Trump, Indictment 71543/23.
15            Case on trial continued.
16            THE COURT:  Okay. I believe we finished up a
17   witness on Friday.
18            We're going to start with a fresh witness today.
19            Is there anything we need to go over from either
20   side before we get started?
21            MR. STEINGLASS:  Just that redactions instruction
22   I ask you to give before we start.
23            THE COURT:  You would ask me to do that first
24   thing?
25            MR. STEINGLASS:  If you don't mind.

2       Q    And do these invoices for 12 payments of $35,000 total
3   $420,000?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    Did you ever direct Ms. Tarasoff to make any further
6   $35,000 payments to Mr. Cohen?
7       A    Not that I remember, no.
8       Q    Did you ever see any other invoices from Mr. Cohen?
9       A    Not that I remember.
10       Q    So, did the payments stop in December 2017 after the
11   December 1st invoice we just saw?
12       A    Yes, I believe so.
13       Q    And, so far as you understood, did these payments
14   satisfy the obligation that you discussed with Mr. Weisselberg
15   in January of 2017?
16       A    They paid the same dollar amount as was on that
17   statement in my notes, yes.
18       Q    Okay.
19                MR. COLANGELO:  Let's display People's 45 in
20        evidence, unless your Honor suggests that now is a good time
21        for a break?
22                THE COURT:  Is this a good time to take a break?
23                MR. COLANGELO:  Yes, your Honor.
24                THE COURT:  All right.  Jurors, let's take our mid
25       morning recess.

1 Q Through your role as Controller, were you familiar
2 with the way The Trump Organization kept and maintained its
3 General Ledgers?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Does each entity that makes up The Trump Organization
6 have its own General Ledger?
7 A If an entity has a bank account, it has a General
8 Ledger.
9 There are a number of entities that we have that did not
10 have a bank account, so they did not have a General Ledger.
11 So, for argument sake, if we would set up an LLC, the LLC
12 would pay for the transactions, so it would have a bank
13 account. The Member Corp. would be a one percent member or
14 one—tenth percent member. We didn’t feel it was a reason for it
15 to have a bank account. Any expenses for that entity could be
16 paid someplace else, so there was no reason to have a bank
17 account or a Ledger.
18 Q For any entity that did have a bank account, it had a
19 General Ledger?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Did The Trump Organization headquarters in Manhattan
22 oversee the accounting for all the entities that make up The
23 Trump Organization?
24 A Not all of them, no.
25 Q Which ones were excluded?

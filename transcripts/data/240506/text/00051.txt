4 CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
5 BY MR. COLANGELO:
6 Q So does the $180,000 amount reflect the total amount
7 owed to Michael Cohen on his request for reimbursement for the
8 $130,000 to Keith Davidson and $50,000 to Red Finch?
9 A Yes.
10 Q Mr. Weisselberg's notes then say "Grossed up to
11 $360,000;" right?
12 A Yes.
13 Q What does "grossed up" mean?
14 A I don't know exactly what it meant, but he probably
15 meant —— so for tax purposes, if Michael recorded $360,000
16 income he would net, assuming a 50 percent tax rate, $180,000.
17 MR. BOVE: Objection. Move to strike the last part
18 of that.
19 THE COURT: Overruled.
20 Q So you are familiar with the concept of grossing up to
21 offset taxes?
22 A Yes.
23 Q You worked as a tax preparer —— you have worked as a
24 tax preparer, I think you said, for five decades?
25 A Yes.

1        48, 49, 54 and 55.
2                 MR. BOVE:  Your Honor, we object to 37A through
3        K, 45, 54, 55.
4                 I think there were other documents on that thumb
5        drive that have not yet been offered, and we'll wait for
6        those.
7                 THE COURT:  So, you're not objecting to 39, 40,
8        43, 44, 48 and 49?
9                 MR. BOVE:  Correct, Judge.
10                 THE COURT:  Those are received into evidence.
11                 (Whereupon, the aforementioned People's Exhibits
12        are received in evidence.)
13                 THE COURT:  As far as 37A through K, 45, 54 and
14        55, I find that the People have laid the business records
15        foundation.
16                 But, you reserve the right to object individually
17        to these as we come across them.
18                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you, Judge.
19       Q    Are you familiar with someone named Michael Cohen?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    How do you know Mr. Cohen?
22       A    Michael was employed by The Trump Organization for a
23   number of years. I've had conversations with him by the
24   coffee -- coffee machine.
25       Q    How many years did you work together?

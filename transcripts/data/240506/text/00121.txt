14                 MR. COLANGELO:  I offer People's 81 into
15       evidence.
16                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
17                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
18                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
19                 record.)
20                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you, Judge.
21                 My first objection to this exhibit is based on
22       the presidential media argument we made.
23                 This is a document that President Trump signed in
24       2018 as President of the United States.  And so, we believe
25       it is an official act that should not come into evidence at

1   the check?
2       A.   Yes.
3       Q.   And so, if, for example, Allen Weisselberg approved an
4   invoice, did somebody have to sign that check or was there still
5   another level of approval?
6       A.   If Allen approved it, no, I would put it in and cut it
7   and get it signed.
8       Q.   What if you cut a check from the DJT account, did
9   Mr. Trump have to sign the check because Mr. Weisselberg
10   approved it?
11       A.   No.  If he didn't want to sign it, he didn't sign it.
12       Q.   Did you ever see situations where he didn't sign
13   checks?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   What would happen in those situations?
16       A.   He would write "Void" on it and send it back.
17       Q.   How do you know he would write "Void" on it?
18       A.   It was signed in a Sharpie in black.  That is what he
19   usually uses.
20       Q.   In the 24 years that you have been there, have you seen
21   Mr. Trump's handwriting?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And his signature?
24       A.   Yes.
25       Q.   Are you familiar with his handwriting?

1                 What she can't testify to is the business record
2        part.
3                 THE COURT:  You are talking about the codes and
4        the stamps and everything else?
5                 MR. BLANCHE:  The hearsay that is being offered
6        for the truth of the matter asserted.  The business record
7        exception to the hearsay rule.
8                 MR. CONROY:  Judge, I don't anticipate eliciting
9        from her what the codes mean.  I anticipate eliciting from
10        her what it is, a check that she issued to Michael Cohen,
11        and a reflection of the fact that it was cashed and
12        cancelled by the bank.
13                 THE COURT:  That's what I am assuming is going to
14        happen.  She is going to say:  This was the check that I
15        generated, I received it back from the bank.
16                 It demonstrates it was cashed, the check number,
17        the same payee, the same amount.
18                 If you want to ask her about these codes and these
19        stamps in the back, you can.  I don't think that is
20        necessary to get the document into evidence.
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  We believe it's a business record of
22        a bank.  That's our objection.
23                 THE COURT:  Okay.  Noted.
24                 Overruled.
25                 Anything else?

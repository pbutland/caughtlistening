1 I don’t think that there is any remote prejudice
2 that the defense will suffer from allowing us to recall her
3 for these limited purposes, which, as I said, include some
4 additional Tweets that were not relevant to Ms. Hicks'
5 testimony, but are relevant to a subsequent witness’
6 testimony.
7 And then to have —— really, the bulk of her
8 testimony will involve going through the exhibit that had
9 been the subject of a lot of back and forth about which
10 portions were appropriate to redact.
11 And I believe at the time that we finalized that,
12 we indicated that we would use a summary witness to read
13 those texts.
14 THE COURT: Mr. Blanche.
15 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I’m looking at the
16 January 29th, 2024 witness list.
17 And I —— Ms. Longstreet is not on it.
18 I’m happy to be told I’m wrong, but that’s what I
19 am referencing when I said that to the Court that I didn't
20 have her name.
21 Secondly, I did not say to the Court at sidebar
22 that we did not the know the exhibits. I said we did not
23 know which exhibits the People were going to offer with
24 respect to this witness.
25 She’s not on it.

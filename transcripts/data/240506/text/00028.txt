1   owes The Trust money, we record it in cash receipts. If a bill
2   is paid, some charged bill, real estate tax bill, that's paid
3   out of The Trust, that's also recorded in the electronic
4   system.
5       Q    How long has the Accounting Department had bank
6   accounts for The Trust?
7       A    That program was written sometime, I believe, in the
8   '90's or whenever that program was written, from that point
9   forward. So, we maintained -- within Multi Data from that point
10   forward, we always maintained bank accounts once we opened
11   them.
12       Q    Does the Accounting Department maintain General
13   Ledgers for Mr. Trump's personal accounts?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Does that account have a particular account code?
16       A    It has a company code, which is an abbreviation used
17   in order to find information or process information.
18       The code is "DJT".
19       Q    When you say "company code" of "DJT", can you describe
20   what that means?
21       A    You have your five or six-digit code in the system
22   you're allowed to use. So, if you want to prohibit a cash
23   disbursement or a list of payments, you have to pick a company.
24   Instead of writing "Donald J. Trump", you would just write in
25   "DJT" and "Company".  It would access information.

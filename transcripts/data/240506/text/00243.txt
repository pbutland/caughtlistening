2 by Mr. Weisselberg or by Mr. McConney, it was approved and you
3 did it; correct?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Now, there were a fair number of questions about the

16 A Yes.
17 Q And during the time working for President Trump, which
18 sounds like it was a long time, and there were a couple of years
19 when he was President when you weren't working for him directly;

21 A Correct.
22 Q But, the time prior to that, you never had any reason

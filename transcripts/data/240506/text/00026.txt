1   Ledgers, trial balances, information that the accountants would
2   need to prepare tax returns or financial statements.
3       Q    How long did The Trump Organization use MDS as its
4   computerized General Ledger?
5       A    That was one of my first jobs back in the '80's, to
6   set up the accounting system.  So, we used it from the day it
7   was up and running, sometime in 1990 or '91. It was still in
8   use when I left.
9       Q    Who enters information into the General Ledger system?
10       A    Mainly, the Accounting Department.
11       Q    Does that include the people we mentioned,
12   Ms. Tarasoff, for example?
13       A    Right.
14       Deb would enter bills to be paid.
15       Q    Can you use MDS to generate reports?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    What kind of reports can MDS generate?
18       A    There are standard reports you can run for Accounts
19   Payable if you wanted to see how much -- how many bills you had
20   that weren't paid. If you wanted to see, um, what vendors --
21   that doesn't make sense.
22       On cash receipts, we can run multi-cash reports, tenant
23   ledgers, rent rolls.
24       There's a variety of reports that you can run.
25       You can also computerize -- I'm sorry -- customize your own

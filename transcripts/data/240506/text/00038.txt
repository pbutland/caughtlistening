1   at any time. You can print it at any time. But, we don't print
2   out that General Ledger for every single check we cut. So, we
3   have a copy of the check or the original check and the invoices
4   behind it. We then scan it and try to attach it to the document
5   in Multi Data. So, we don't really have the General Ledger
6   attached when we sign the check.

8       Q    Setting aside whether you maintain the General Ledger
9   entries as part of the checks cut, does The Trump Organization
10   separately maintain records of entries that are made in the
11   General Ledger?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    With respect to the records we just discussed,
14   invoices, entries in the General Ledger, and checks, was it the
15   business practice of The Trump Organization to make and keep
16   those records?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And was it the business practice of The Trump
19   Organization to make and keep notes regarding payments it made?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Were those records made and kept in the regular and
22   ordinary course of business?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Were those records made at the time of the
25   transactions they reflected or within a reasonable time

1       Q    And can you read out loud both the year indicator and
2   the year?
3       A    The year is -- it says, Year Annual Report Only, 2017.
4       Q    Do you understand this to be an Annual Report as
5   opposed to a new entry report?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    Let's take a look at the middle of the first page and
8   can you blowup that date, please?
9            What's the date that this was signed and certified?
10       A    May 15, 2018.
11       Q    So I think you said a minute ago that this was a
12   report related to the first 20 days of 2017.
13            Having looked at the report type, year and date, do
14   you have a different understanding?
15       A    I was going by the upper left-hand corner, which was
16   the date.  I misread it.
17            Yes, the years, I misinterpreted the years.
18       Q    Well, do you understand this to be the annual report
19   for 2017, which was signed and certified and submitted in 2018?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Thank you.
22            Do you recognize the signature on that first signature
23   line?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    Whose signature is it?

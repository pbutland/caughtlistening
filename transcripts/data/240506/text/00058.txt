1 wanted to do; he wanted to double the 180,000 for taxes, so I
2 just wrote the "times two for taxes."
3 Q And you told me before that if a Trump Organization
4 employee submitted an invoice for an expense reimbursement for
5 one hundred dollars, that employee would typically expect to
6 get one hundred dollars back; right?
7 A Yes.
8 Q And in this case, Mr Cohen was receiving $360,000
9 dollars back on a $180,000 expense?
10 A I'm sorry.
11 Ask me that again?
12 Q Does that show that Mr. Cohen was receiving $360,000
13 back on a $180,000 expense?
14 A Yes.
15 Q Were you aware of another expense reimbursement where a
16 payment was doubled for taxes?
17 A No.
18 Q Your notes then go on to add up the totals and sum them
19 up to $410,000; is that right?
20 A Yes.
21 Q And you then wrote, "Use 420," right?
22 A Yes.
23 Q Can you please explain that again?
24 A That's when I told Allen what I came up with; he said,
25 no, "Use 420."

1   another entity.
2       In this case, DJT Management Holdings LLC owns a hundred
3   percent of all the entities below it.
4       Q    Do the remaining schedules in this show the 500 or so
5   entities were owned by The Trust as of January of 2017?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    When was The Trust itself created?
8       A    I'm not too sure.
9       I think the first page said 2014, but I'm really not sure.
10                 MR. COLANGELO:  Let's go back to the first page.
11                 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12       Q    Let me direct your attention to the top.
13       Is that the date you're referring to?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Do you have an understanding based on that when The
16   Trust was created?
17       A    We didn't use it in 2014 or '15, so I don't know if
18   that's when it was set up.
19       I'm not a lawyer. So, that's my guess, that it was set up
20   in April of 2014.
21       Q    In 2017, who were the Trustees of The Trust?
22       A    Donald J. Trump, Junior and Allen Weisselberg.
23       Q    You testified a minute ago that your position when you
24   retired from The Trump Organization was Senior Vice President
25   and Controller; is that right?

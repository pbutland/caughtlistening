1       I spoke with Giuliani yesterday and he told me the
2   following:
3       He said he spoke with Stephen Ryan of McDermott Will &
4   Emery, Mike's current attorney, and he and Jay Sekulow will be
5   meeting with Ryan in Washington on Wednesday or Thursday of this
6   week.
7       He indicated that the President was paying for McDermott
8   Will & Emery to review the documentation for the attorney-client
9   privilege issues.
10       He may have meant Trump Enterprises, but he did say that the
11   President -- he also said the President was satisfied with Ryan
12   and MWE was the right group to go through all of the documents,
13   but after that he wanted more aggressive lawyers representing
14   Cohen, us.
15       He said the President was being charged $200,000 by MWE for
16   the document review and that Jay Sekulow told Trump that was an
17   outrageously large fee.
18       I spoke with Giuliani about the text message that I had sent
19   him the previous Friday, in which I outlined the argument that
20   Mueller had already found that there was no Russian collusion
21   with Michael Cohen because after doing all of this
22   investigation, last November, he transferred the case to the
23   Southern District.
24       I said that it was important to reverse the Avenatti-created
25   Russian spin to the Cohen investigation, and the best way to do

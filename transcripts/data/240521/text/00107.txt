Charge Conference
4402
1 meeting.
2 There just is no reasonable view of the evidence
3 that that was a perfectly benign discussion or a
4 high—minded conversation about democracy.
5 We know that because Mr. Pecker left that
6 meeting, immediately told a small handful of trusted
7 lieutenants, directed them to keep it secret, and then
8 proceeded to do all the other steps in the conspiracy
9 which we allege are unlawful, including things he had
10 never ever done before and were not part of his typical
11 practice.
12 The trial doesn't support the first paragraph,
13 either.
14 THE COURT: Let's turn to "unlawful means".
15 Start with the People.
16 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor.
17 Here, I think the two paragraphs that we propose
18 that are bracketed in yellow are intended to give the jury
19 some guidance on what "unlawful" means.
20 The most critical point here is that the jury
21 does not need to conclude unanimously what the specific
22 unlawful means are. That's the key point here.
23 We understand the Defense opposes that, but
24 there's sort of well—established New York Law, that a jury
25 does not have to be unanimous about unlawful means about

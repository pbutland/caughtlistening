12 MR. BOVE: —— in response to the impeachment.
13 THE COURT: You can't use what was not questioned
14 about or asked about on cross; and her cross was based on
15 your direct.
16 MR. BOVE: It's in response to the cross that I am
17 now asking on my redirect ——
18 THE COURT: You went through questions on direct,
19 Ms. Hoffinger had the opportunity to cross—examine the
20 witness in response to what you asked on direct. You now
21 cannot hammer home what you asked on direct if she did not
22 cover it. That's not the way it works.
23 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge. Understood.
24 (Sidebar concluded.)
25 THE COURT: The objection is sustained.

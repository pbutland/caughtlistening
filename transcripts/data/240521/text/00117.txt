Charge Conference
4412
1                (The following proceedings are continued from
2    the previous page.)
3                MR. BOVE:  Separate from the factual issue here,
4    Judge, we do have our additional position, which is that
5    these -- this back and forth that we are talking about, and
6    we don't think that the inferences that were just described
7    are supported by the trial record.
8               But even if they were, an agreement after the
9    election to do these things is not an agreement to promote
10    President Trump's candidacy in the 2016 election.
11               A conspiracy doesn't automatically continue past
12    the accomplishment of its objectives.
13               And so, the issue here is that on the
14    Government's theory, when President Trump won, the
15    conspiracy -- this is 17-152 -- the conspiracy was
16    accomplished.
17             And so, for that additional reason, as a matter of
18    law, the tax predicates should not go to the jury on this
19    theory because they could not have possibly have promoted
20    President Trump's election, because it had already happened.
21            THE COURT:  Yes?
22            MR. COLANGELO:  I think the Court rejected that
23   argument, as a matter of law, in your Honor's decision on
24   Omnibus Motions in February.
25            And, in any event, the trial record clearly

1            But, there's no illegal conspiracy.
2            That's the key. It's got to be an illegal
3   conspiracy, unless the conspiracy's object, one of them,
4   is criminal.
5            So, it's not enough for the Government to
6   establish a civil violation of FECA or to suggest to the
7   jury that -- I understand that they don't have to prove a
8   substantive violation of FECA -- but to suggest that the
9   object conspiracy was a civil violation of FECA.  Because
10   what we're talking about is a civil conspiracy, which
11   can't serve as a predicate for the business records
12   charges.
13            If I can cite some cases on the conspiracy to the
14   crime has to have a criminal object:
15            People v. Wisan, W-I-S-A-N.  This is a Richmond
16   County case. It's a little vague in 1986. But, what it
17   says is that the United States Supreme Court has held,
18   time and again, that to be a criminal conspiracy, there
19   must be a criminal object.
20            And one of the Supreme Court cases cited in Wisan
21   is Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391 at 404, 405.
22            What that means to us, Judge, and why we're
23   asking for the "willfully" instruction when you talk about
24   FECA is that, otherwise, it would allow the jury to think
25   about the predicate offense and the objects of this

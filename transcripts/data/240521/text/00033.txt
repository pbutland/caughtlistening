R. Costello - Redirect/Bove
4328
1   decision?
2       A    No, he didn't.
3       Q    And did he, in fact, continue to give you instructions
4   in order to continue to review things with Rudy Giuliani?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    Now, let's talk about some of those instructions,
7   like --
8                 MR. BOVE:  Let's look at Government Exhibit 204,
9        please.
10                 (Displayed.)
11                MR. BOVE:  And if you could zoom in a bit.
12                 (Displayed.)
13       Q    I want to focus on the last two sentences, and there is
14   a reference to "back channel."
15       Do you see that?
16       A    I do.
17       Q    And so, this is the same day as the last email that we
18   looked at, April 21st, 2018; right?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    And it's another email that you put that legend at the
21   top, "Privileged and confidential;" correct?
22       A    That is correct.
23       Q    And you are updating Cohen on what you had written,
24   what you had said to Giuliani; right?
25       A    That is correct.

Charge Conference
4349
1   in the earlier submission.
2            I have not briefed that case.
3            If your Honor needs further analysis, we can take
4   a look.
5            But, the plain text of the statute provides that
6   Election Law conspiracy occurs when its intended results
7   are executed through unlawful means.
8            Because it doesn't need to be "criminal unlawful
9   means", there's no need to add the word "willful" into the
10   FECA charge.
11            MR. BOVE:  Can I briefly respond to this one,
12   Judge?
13            THE COURT:  Sure.
14            MR. BOVE:  The Government's main case for this,
15   Ivybrooke, as your Honor sees in the briefing, it's a
16   civil case about Executive Law 63(12). That case does not
17   suggest -- provide any support for the Government's
18   position here, which is that a criminal conspiracy charge
19   can be supported by a civil object.
20            And that's what they're seeking to do.
21            That's at the core here with respect to
22   "willfully" down at the FECA predicate.
23            But, again, when we start talking about New York
24   Election Law, that's extremely problematic.
25            And another reason that it is -- both sides have

1 example, the FEC's exception when it came to the FEC
2 involvement in the facts of this case.
3 PEG involvement was not a function of its limited
4 activity, but, instead, fell outside that for four
5 reasons. We outlined those four factors in the proposal we
6 sent to the Court last week. We stripped it out, following
7 the Court's guidance yesterday, to be a little more
8 concise.
9 If the Court is inclined to include an exception,
10 we think it should be something closer to the facts of the
11 case that the jury is likely to understand and not a
12 confusing and attenuated example about solicitation
13 records that were referenced in a District Court case from
14 1981.
15 MR. BOVE: So, the issue for us, Judge, is that
16 this concept, "normal, legitimate press function" —— I'm
17 quoting from the preceding sentence —— it is actually an
18 extremely broad concept as interpreted by the FEC.
19 We proposed an attenuated example to stay away
20 from the facts of this case, so the jury can have a sense
21 of, in our view, why this is very broad and, at the same
22 time, not get a legal instruction that as a metaphor of
23 law goes one way or another on AMI's facts.
24 In terms of AMI's Conciliatory Agreement, we
25 don't think that represents a "legitimate press function"

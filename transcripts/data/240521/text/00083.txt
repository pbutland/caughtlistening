1   jury, to approach and understand the facts of this case.
2            MR. BOVE:  Each of the cases cited by the
3   Government for this proposition are not -- they don't
4   support -- they're not jury instruction cases at all.   One
5   of them, Murray, is an accessorial liability case.
6            Legally, there are two reasons this would be
7   error.
8            Number one, this concept that I've already
9   articulated, it would put the jury in the position of
10   finding the President guilty of causing the causer two
11   steps of accessorial liability.  That's number one.
12            Problem number two is made clear by the CJI charge
13   on accessorial liability.  There has to be corresponding
14   intent.  To tell the jury at this point in the instruction,
15   you can find causation based on reasonable foreseeability,
16   but de-couple that from the intent requirement, would make
17   this completely wrong as a matter of law.
18            MR. COLANGELO:  Just two quick points.
19            First, the defendant could act in concert with
20   Mr. Weisselberg to make or cause Jeffrey McConney or
21   Deborah Tarasoff to make false entries.
22            But, second, the cases directly support the legal
23   instruction that we propose.
24            The People versus Miles case, for example, is the
25   affirmative conviction of a defendant who was convicted of

Charge Conference

1   President Trump was present when others agreed to engage in
2   performance of a crime, does not by itself show that
3   President Trump personally agreed to engage in the
4   conspiracy.  Proof of separate or independent conspiracy is
5   not sufficient.  In determining whether or not any single
6   conspiracy has been shown by the evidence in the case, you
7   must decide whether common goals or objectives existed and
8   served as the focal points in the efforts and actions of
9   the members of the agreement."
10            "In arriving at this decision, you may consider
11   the length of time that the alleged conspiracy existed and
12   mutual independence or existence between various persons
13   alleged to have been its members and the complexity of the
14   goal or objective."
15            So, let's begin with that one sentence the People
16   want to add.
17            MR. COLANGELO:  So, your Honor, this is drawn from
18   and tracked as closely as possible with the CJI charge for
19   conspiracy in the sixth degree, Penal Law 105.00.  We
20   simply substituted in language referencing that the conduct
21   that would be performed is the conduct to promote or
22   prevent the election of a person to public office by
23   unlawful means.
24            We have taken the CJI charge for Conspiracy 6 and
25   adapted it for this circumstance.

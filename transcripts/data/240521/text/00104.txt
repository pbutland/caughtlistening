Charge Conference

1   the Trump Tower meeting of August of '15 is evidence of
2   participation, not mere presence.
3            This would be confusing and lead the jury in a
4   skewed understanding of the facts the trial record does
5   not support.
6            THE COURT:  That's a different argument.
7            Is there a reasonable view of the evidence to
8   support that claim?
9            MR. BOVE:  We certainly think so.
10            I think the August 2015 meeting was a good
11   example. From our perspective, what was discussed in that
12   meeting, if you credit the People's witnesses, is a series
13   of pretty standard campaign activity that were not
14   criminal and being practiced by candidates around the
15   country for decades. Mr. Pecker described some of that.
16            And the jury can certainly reach that finding.
17            So, I was actually -- before Mr. Colangelo said
18   that, I was going to raise that as my example as mere
19   presence can be very much a part of the defense here,
20   because sitting in that room, hearing people talk about
21   trying to get positive press coverage, avoid negative
22   press coverage, not have negative stories come out about
23   someone, the Defense's position is there's nothing
24   criminal at all about that.
25            So, that's why I think "mere presence" is

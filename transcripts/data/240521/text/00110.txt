Charge Conference
4405
1   established beyond a reasonable doubt, so we think it's
2   confusing and inaccurate to refer to a requirement of
3   proof.
4            Again, the only proof obligation the People have,
5   which is a high one, is to establish that this Defendant
6   had made or caused false entries in the business records
7   of his enterprises, with an intent to defraud and the
8   intent to conceal the commission of another crime. But,
9   there's no proof requirement as to the object crime.
10            So, we oppose the use of the word "proof".
11            I think the second key disagreement here is we
12   believe the Court should advise the jury that there are
13   three different unlawful means that the co-conspirators
14   intended to execute in order to promote the Defendant's
15   election unlawfully: violations of the Federal Election
16   Campaign Act, falsification of other business records, and
17   the violation of Tax Laws.
18            And we understand -- and I believe this is a
19   sufficiency argument.
20            We understand that the Defense opposes that third
21   category, the violation of Tax Laws.
22            MR. BOVE:  Judge, we think that the Government
23   does have to put forward some proof of the objects of the
24   17-152 conspiracy.  Because if they don't prove up
25   criminal objects, then there is no criminal conspiracy.

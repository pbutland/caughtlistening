Charge Conference

1            He didn't agree to do anything.
2            There's that 1099 Miscellaneous Form which just
3   only reflects and it confirms in an open way that payments
4   were made to Mr. Cohen. The Trump Organization was
5   transparent about this.
6            That's not evidence of some kind of agreement to
7   make false tax filings by Mr. Cohen.
8            And Mr. Cohen testified that he didn't know
9   anything about it.
10            So, that's the factual basis for this argument.
11            MR. COLANGELO:  I don't think that testimony can
12   fairly be characterized as indicating Mr. Cohen didn't
13   know anything about it.
14            He separately testified that it was grossed up
15   because he was going to take it as income.
16            He knew full well it was not income. He knew it
17   was a reimbursement.
18            The trial record supports it was a reimbursement
19   because it tracks directly the $100,000 to Keith Davidson.
20            Arguably, there's competing evidence the parties
21   can present to the jury.
22            We don't remotely think it's income for work.
23            We think the transcript shows he knew he was
24   getting income for reimbursement that they were calling
25   "income" when it's not.

Charge Conference
4353
1            So, here, what we want the jury to understand is
2   that as someone in President Trump's situation is
3   evaluating potentially or allegedly proposed payments by
4   third parties, part of his understanding is somebody --
5   and there is testimony in the record about the campaign
6   having counsel -- would understand that he could have paid
7   this out of his personal expenses, without issue.
8            MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, we oppose including
9   that sentence for the reason that the Court may have been
10   suggesting, which is that it's extraneous and totally
11   irrelevant to the facts of the case.
12            This case is not about a candidate's use of his
13   own personal expenses for his campaign or other purposes.
14            So, it has nothing to do with the case, is
15   extraneous, and will probably be confusing to the jury.
16            If the Court is inclined to include something
17   like this, which we think shouldn't be included, this
18   language is not a quote from the Regulations Act, is
19   misleading, including the reference to "no limit on
20   someone's ability".
21            There's plenty of regulations on someone's
22   ability. The Regulations Act maintains candidates can make
23   contributions from personal funds.
24            It is worded inaccurately.
25            In any event, this is extraneous and confusing.

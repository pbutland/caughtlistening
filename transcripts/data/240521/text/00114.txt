1 reimbursement —— as income rather than reimbursement.
2 And then, as the Court also saw through the 1099s
3 that were submitted to the IRS, carrying forward that
4 deception through documents that not only were intended to
5 be, but ultimately were, submitted to Government agencies,
6 all is evidence of false —— submission of false
7 information to Tax Authorities; and those elements, alone,
8 establish the City, State and Federal Tax violations that
9 we identified.
10 MR. BOVE: The problem with this theory, Judge,
11 and the reason that it shouldn't go to the jury is that
12 Michael Cohen testified that he didn't know anything about
13 it.
14 And I'm referring to the transcript at 3490,
15 Lines 6 through 9.
16 He was asked: "What, if any, understanding do you
17 have about why he" —— why Allen Weisselberg —— "grossed
18 that reimbursement up to $360,000?"
19 "Answer: I don't know. And, to be honest, I
20 didn't even really think about it. I just wanted to get my
21 money back."
22 That testimony is the reason that the tax
23 predicate should not go to this jury, because what the
24 Government's theory is, is that they're talking about tax
25 filings by Mr. Cohen.

Charge Conference

1 involve the same players. Maybe one person overlapped.
2 One civil conspiratorial agreement in August of 2015 and
3 one —— in crediting the best view for their side of the
4 evidence —— potentially criminal conspiracy in
5 January 2017.
6 And we need to be clear with the jury that they
7 need to find —— when they're looking at this issue,
8 evidence of President Trump having intent to commit or
9 conceal a criminal conspiracy. And that's what we're
10 trying to capture here in the "multiple conspiracies"
11 instruction.
12 MR. COLANGELO: Language like this is necessary
13 only when the Defendant is actually charged with a
14 conspiracy, which he isn't in this case.
15 And the jury doesn't have to decide whether he's
16 guilty of a single conspiracy or whether there were,
17 instead, multiple conspiracies.
18 It's irrelevant whether there was a single
19 conspiracy or multiple ones, as long as he had some intent
20 to conceal the conspiracy, whether he, himself, even
21 participated in it.
22 So, we think it's extraneous and shouldn't be
23 included, at risk of confusing the jury.
24 One point, going back to the comment Mr. Bove
25 made on the trial record regarding the Trump Tower

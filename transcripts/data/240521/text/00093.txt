Charge Conference

1 about that is very significant for the People here.
2 And so, to say things about what they do not have
3 to prove, where we haven't argued otherwise, we don't think
4 this is an issue for the jury to be instructed on.
5 MR. COLANGELO: We don't think there is any burden
6 shifting risk here. Although, this language isn't in the
7 pattern charge, similar language does exist in other
8 pattern charges.
9 So, for example, the standard jury instruction on
10 accessorial liability reads, "In order to find the
11 defendant guilty, however, you need not be unanimous on
12 whether the defendant committed the crime personally or by
13 acting in concert with another, or both."
14 So the CJI standard charges do include this kind
15 of language regarding what the Government need not prove
16 in circumstances where it would otherwise be confusing for
17 the jury not to get an instruction like that.
18 The reasonable doubt charges also says what the
19 People don't have to prove.
20 And then, your Honor, again, particularly where we
21 are going to be going into some detail regarding the
22 contours of the object crime, the intended crime, the
23 predicate, we think it would be particularly confusing for
24 the jury not to be told what they are to make of the
25 instruction they are about to get regarding the Election

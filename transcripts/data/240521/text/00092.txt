1 that is the balanced way to go forward.
2 MR. COLANGELO: The problem with revisiting that
3 sentence, your Honor, is that it's not an accurate
4 characterization of the law, notwithstanding that it comes
5 from the Practice Commentaries.
6 I mention, again, that it refers only to a
7 suggestion and concurring opinion. But, as your Honor
8 already held in the Court's Omnibus Opinion, that intent to
9 defraud does not need to be directed at any person or a
10 specific person. So the reference to leading another into
11 error just does —— is not a statement of the law as the
12 Court has acknowledged already.
13 THE COURT: Let's move on to intent to commit or
14 conceal another crime. Tell me why you are opposing that?
15 MR. BOVE: It's a very similar issue, so I don't
16 need to belabor it. These are further instructions
17 extrapolated from case law and from your Honor's pretrial
18 rulings. We understand and have adhered to it, both the
19 effect of giving an instruction like this is to, again,
20 calling the jury's attention to things that the Government
21 does not have to prove, which we are not suggesting that
22 they have to prove.
23 So, there is a lot of yellow on this page and the
24 preceding page. What we perceived here is a risk of burden
25 shifting and diminishing the burden that your Honor talked

Charge Conference

1 In that event, there is no predicate to elevate the 175.10
2 charges up to a felony.
3 So, under these circumstances, the way the
4 Government chose to put this theory of this case to this
5 jury, there does need to be proof. Because, otherwise, the
6 jury could find that there was a conspiracy to promote
7 President Trump's election without unlawful means, in
8 which case, that would not support what the Government is
9 going to ask this jury to do.
10 So, we think that our language is an accurate
11 statement of the law, and proof is required that there
12 were criminal objects of this conspiracy. Because,
13 otherwise, there's no unlawful means. In that event,
14 there's no 17â€”152 conspiracy, and there's no basis to
15 elevate this up to a felony.
16 THE COURT: Yes.
17 MR. COLANGELO: Under People v. Mackey, the
18 People weren't even required to identify any object crime.
19 As the Court knows, in The Trump Corporation
20 trial, the jury instructions did not identify an object
21 crime.
22 In nearly all burglary cases, the Court doesn't
23 identify an object crime.
24 We attempted to do so to make the evidence as
25 clear as possible for the jury and to help them understand

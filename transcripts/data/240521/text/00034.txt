R. Costello - Redirect/Bove
4329
1       Q    So, Cohen is in no position to be surprised that you
2   are communicating to Giuliani on his behalf; is he?
3       A    He asked me to.
4       Q    And, now, let's focus on the words "back channel."
5       Between Michael Cohen, you, and Rudy Giuliani, who first
6   used the word "back channel?"
7       A    Rudy Giuliani, in response to my telling him we
8   couldn't make this public, because that's what Michael Cohen had
9   said to me:  You can tell Rudy Giuliani and the President's team
10   that you want -- quote, that you were, quote, on the team, but
11   we don't want to go public with this; and he gave an excuse, it
12   would cause a press uproar.
13       Q    And this is April 21st, the day after the email that
14   you sent to your son and the half-an-hour call with Cohen;
15   right?
16       A    That's right.
17       Q    And Giuliani used the word "back channel," you said?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    And that is after you described to him the instructions
20   that Michael Cohen provided to you; right?
21       A    Yes.  That is right.
22                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
23                THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       Q    Now, let's take a look at Defense Exhibit E1008,
25   please.

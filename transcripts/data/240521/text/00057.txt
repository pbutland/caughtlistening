Charge Conference
4352
1 MR. BOVE: The problem for us, Judge, is that the
2 mens rea for the predicate, the 17—152 charge, the
3 conspiracy charge has to match the highest mens rea of the
4 objects. 1 think that's Black—letter law.
5 And so, all the points I've already made, I
6 think, stand on for this to be a criminal conspiracy,
7 there has to be a criminal object. But, in addition, that
8 "willfully" mens rea has to come up to the level of the
9 predicate; or, otherwise, again, we just have a civil
10 conspiracy, that it can't be used to elevate this to a
11 felony.
12 THE COURT: Thank you.
13 Let's go down to the next disputed area, which is
14 the last sentence in the first paragraph.
15 The Defense is requesting language that in 2015
16 and 2016, there was no limit on a candidate's ability to
17 contribute personal funds to his or her campaign.
18 Why do you need that instruction?
19 MR. BOVE: Judge, we're quoting the regulation,
20 and we're seeking that instruction because we want the
21 jury to have a full picture of what constitutes
22 "contributions" and "expenditures", and the third party
23 issue is significant in this case, but President Trump's
24 mental state and the Government's burden of proof on his
25 mental state also matters.

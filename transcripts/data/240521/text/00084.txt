1   falsifying business records by attaching jumper cables to
2   the electrical box outside his home, and in doing so,
3   making or causing false entries in the records of the power
4   plant.
5            Nobody said he went into the power company's power
6   accumulation system and altered how the billing records
7   were going to coming out, but applying jumper cables
8   supported the conviction.
9            So, on facts like the ones we have here, and given
10   the way the parties have had to argue the case, we think
11   this is a very straightforward explanation of the law that
12   is important for the jury to understand.
13            THE COURT:  My only question:  Isn't this already
14   covered in the definition of accomplice liability?
15            If you look at the second page, the entire
16   definition, the  second page, the second full paragraph
17   says, "The People have the burden of proving beyond a
18   reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with state of
19   mind required for the commission of the crime, and either
20   personally, or by acting in concert with another person,
21   committed each of the remaining elements of the crime."
22            And it goes on to say, "It doesn't matter what the
23   relative contribution was to the crime of each of the
24   defendants.
25            Why is this basically not duplicative of that?

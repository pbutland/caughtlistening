Charge Conference
4358
1            MR. COLANGELO:  Thank you, your Honor.
2            So, the preceding sentence in that paragraph
3   identifies -- which the parties have agreed on, identifies
4   the regulatory definition for when a third-party's payment
5   of a candidate's special expenses counts as a
6   contribution. That's when it would not have been made
7   irrespective of the candidacy.
8            Our purpose in adding this additional language
9   was twofold.
10            First, the "irrespective of the candidacy" and
11   the way the language appears in the Regulation is not, on
12   its face, the most artful turn of phrase, and we thought
13   it might be a useful explanation for the jury, to help
14   them understand: What does it mean for a third-party's
15   payment of a personal candidate's personal expenses to be
16   done irrespective of the candidacy?
17            And this gloss that we've identified in this
18   additional sentence is language directly from an FEC
19   advisory opinion, which is a binding and definitive
20   interpretation of FECA issued by the Commission and that
21   the Commission has looked to define when something is
22   "irrespective of a candidate".
23            That's the first reason.
24            The second reason is that there's been factual
25   testimony -- and we anticipate this will be a contested

Charge Conference
4416
1            THE SERGEANT:  Remain seated.  Part 59 is back in
2   session.
3            THE COURT:  All right.  That was pretty much what I
4   had.
5            I would like to hear if you have any issues or
6   arguments that you would like to bring to my attention now.
7            MR. BOVE:  Yes, your Honor, thank you.
8            There are some instructions that we requested in
9   the defendant's request submission that you referenced.
10            THE COURT:  Yes.
11            MR. BOVE:  I think that we don't have controversial
12   arguments about too many of them, but there are a couple of
13   them that are worth discussing.
14            We proposed a limiting instruction with respect to
15   bias that is specific to President Trump.
16            It is one that we modified from the instruction
17   that your Honor gave at the Trump Org trial that we think is
18   appropriate here.
19            There are sort of parallel competing proposals to
20   some extent, but I don't know that the differences are
21   material.
22            THE COURT:  Can you direct me to the page in your
23   submission that you are referring to?
24            MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge, one second.
25            (Pause.)

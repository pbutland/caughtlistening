R. Costello â€” Redirect/Bove
4320
1 Q Yes or no? Yes or no? Do you have animosity against
2 Michael Cohen?
3 A No.
4 Q Well, last week, on May 15th, didn't you go to Congress
5 to testify about this case and testify all about Michael Cohen;
6 didn't you go to the House of Representatives to do that?
7 A Yes. I was requested to go by the House of
8 Representatives, and I went.
9 Q And you went there to publicly vilify Michael Cohen
10 while he was in the middle of his testimony; isn't that
11 correct?
12 A I went there to testify.
13 Q And you knew your comments would be reported in the
14 press; correct?
15 A I didn't know, although it's certainly possible.
16 Q And it was an effort by you, wasn't it, to try to
17 intimidate Michael Cohen while he was testifying here; isn't
18 that correct?
19 A I was intimidating him?
20 Q Yes, that's my question.
21 A That's ridiculous. No.
22 MS. HOFFINGER: Nothing further.
23 THE COURT: Any redirect?
24 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge, thank you.
25 May I inquire, Judge?

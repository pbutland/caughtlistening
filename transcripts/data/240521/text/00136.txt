Charge Conference

1 instruction about involvement of counsel, Judge.
2 And I'm just trying to grab the page number. I
3 believe it's Page 12.
4 We think that the door was opened by the Government
5 on direct examination of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker by ——
6 through a series of questions about a conversation that
7 Mr. Pecker had with Mr. Cohen relating to the Agreements
8 involved —— that concern Ms. McDougal.
9 And we flagged this issue in advance of the trial,
10 that in the records that were disclosed to us, there was
11 this comment about the agreement being "bulletproof."
12 It is a fair inference from that, the use of that
13 word by Mr. Pecker, that what he meant was that it had been
14 vetted by counsel.
15 He actually testified, I believe on direct, that it
16 had been vetted by counsel.
17 What happened then, Judge, is that Mr. Cohen —— and
18 this was to some extent from us unexpected —— Mr. Cohen
19 confirmed that he communicated that word to President Trump.
20 That was an evidentiary link we hadn't necessarily
21 anticipated at this trial, absent President Trump taking the
22 stand.
23 Once that evidentiary link was made, there is a
24 fair inference that he —— he understood that to mean that it
25 had been vetted by counsel, that the Agreement was legal.

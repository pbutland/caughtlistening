Charge Conference

1 the subpoenas to Mr. Cohen who could —— where your Honor
2 held that evidence regarding his ultimate tax treatment of
3 the payments is irrelevant to the question of whether, when
4 they decided in January 2017 to gross it up, and to do so in
5 order to conceal the reimbursement as income, whether that,
6 at that moment, included an intent to commit tax law
7 violations, which we believe it did.
8 THE COURT: All right. I have one more question,
9 then I want to take a short break.
10 The People have submitted proposed language for
11 Counts 32 through 34.
12 Have you had a chance to look at them?
13 MR. BOVE: We have, Judge.
14 And our concern with the proposal is that to try
15 and summarize the elements at the end, as well as the
16 description of which document is attached to which count,
17 would be to sort of limit the jury's consideration or at
18 least there would be a risk of them confusing their
19 consideration of all of the things that you told them about
20 each of the counts.
21 So, we think the better course would be at the
22 beginning of the counts to then give them the substance of
23 —— the real substance of what's at issue here, such as:
24 Ladies and gentlemen, what I'm about to say applies
25 to Counts 1 through 34.

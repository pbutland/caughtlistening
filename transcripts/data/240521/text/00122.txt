Charge Conference
4417
1 THE COURT: Here it is. Page 5.
2 MR. BOVE: Right.
3 We've also requested an instruction.
4 THE COURT: Do you want to talk any more about that
5 one?
6 MR. BOVE: No, your Honor.
7 THE COURT: All right. I would like to hear from
8 the People.
9 MR. STEINGLASS: We would like to talk —— we would
10 like to be heard on it.
11 First of all, we don't think that this is
12 necessary, this charge.
13 I think the voir dire has satisfied this problem.
14 I think this charge was more appropriate —— and Mr. Bove
15 cites the Trump Corporation trial, it was more appropriate
16 there where the defendant was not —— well, this defendant
17 was not a defendant in that case.
18 And your Honor, I believe, the point of that
19 instruction was trying to remind the jury to keep Mr. Trump
20 out of the last trial because it wasn't —— he was not a
21 named defendant.
22 I don't think that instructing a jury that they
23 shouldn't hold bias against the defendant is necessary;
24 however, I think —— I mean, and I think that your Honor’s
25 standard charge talks about excluding sympathy and bias.

Charge Conference
4394
1            We think, as the Court said a moment ago, tracking
2   as closely as possible where there is standard CJI
3   language is appropriate and useful.
4            Here there is standard CJI language on conspiracy.
5            THE COURT:  You have your added language to that
6   paragraph.  You go on to add two more paragraphs.
7            MR. BOVE:  So the yellow and blue on Page 1, I
8   think are competing proposals.
9            THE COURT:  I understand.
10            MR. BOVE:  I think the real dispute between the
11   parties is the wilfully language, from our perspective.
12            From our perspective, for the 17-152 conspiracy
13   to be a criminal conspiracy, there has to be intent that
14   reflects the highest level of intent of the objects of the
15   conspiracy.
16            Here we've had the argument at the beginning about
17   FECA, and our position is that, for this to be a criminal
18   conspiracy at all, it has to be a criminal violation of
19   FECA.  Criminal conspiracy has to have a criminal object.
20            But, in addition to that, the Federal tax unlawful
21   means that the Government has proposed, they concede in
22   their request, that that is a statute that requires
23   wilfulness.
24            So, there are two unlawful means proposed by the
25   Government, two categories, at least, FECA and tax crimes,

6       Q    Do you remember sending this email to Mr. Cohen on
7   April 21st of 2018?
8       A    Yes, I do.
9       Q    I will read to the jury from the email:
10       Michael, I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on
11   your team.
12       Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better
13   situation for the President or you.
14       He asked me if it was okay to call the President and Jay
15   Sekulow and I said, fine.
16       We discussed the facts, Jay Goldberg's stupid remarks, et
17   cetera.  He said I can't tell you how pleased I am that I can
18   work with someone I know and trust.
19       He asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is
20   on you and your family and he will make sure to tell the
21   President.
22       He said thank you for opening this back channel of
23   communication and asked me to keep in touch.
24       I told him I would after speaking to you further.
25       Bob.

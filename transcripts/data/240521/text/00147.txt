Charge Conference
4442
1   charge the jury as though their arguments are both factual
2   and legal ones.
3            They can make whatever arguments they want,
4   although, I would suggest that they -- those arguments be
5   based in the actual record and not the imaginary record.
6            MR. BOVE:  I think, if your Honor reviews the
7   testimony of Mr. Daus, what you will see is that there
8   was -- there was a factory reset, I believe it was in the
9   Fall of 2016 in a very relevant time frame.
10            That there was testimony that there was a sync.
11   That the sync came from a laptop with a user name from
12   Michael Cohen, and that he was unable to verify in any way
13   what was loaded back onto the phone because he never had
14   access to the laptop.
15            Not at all what Mr. Steinglass just said about a
16   complete backup.
17            And our argument is not that the evidence was
18   deleted for the purposes of this instruction, the factual
19   basis is not that evidence was deleted in 2020 when he reset
20   it again or in 2023 when it was mishandled, the inference is
21   in 2016 when he did the reset, and he loaded something else
22   that we don't know about onto the phone.
23            In addition, the use of the apps that involve
24   self-exploding messages and the deletion of messages that he
25   concededly sent in 2016 also supports the instruction.

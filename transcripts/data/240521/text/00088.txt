Charge Conference
4383
1   FECA charge, for example, where we agree that it makes a
2   lot of sense for the Court to take a less is more approach
3   because there the Court was considering charging language
4   on an unlawful means element of a predicate offense, these
5   are actual definitional terms in the charged crime.
6            So if there is anywhere that it makes sense to
7   give the jury more guidance, it's in defining terms like
8   intent to defraud and intent to conceal or commit another
9   crime.
10            The Court took a similar approach in the Trump
11   Corporation tax fraud case by defining when the defendants
12   wrongfully took, obtained or withheld money from their
13   owner in order to support larceny charges.  And the Court
14   referred to the owner as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
15            And so, this is an approach the Court adopted in
16   other cases, and we think the additional language here is
17   warranted.
18            THE COURT:  I will reserve on that.  I don't have
19   a problem with the very last sentence.  It's a full
20   paragraph.  Intent to defraud is not constricted to an
21   intent to deprive another of property or money.  In fact,
22   intent to defraud can extend beyond economic concerns.
23            I don't think that is in dispute.  That is what I
24   ruled earlier, and it is the law.
25            MR. BOVE:  I agree, that it's not something we're

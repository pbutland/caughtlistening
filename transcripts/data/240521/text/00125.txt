1            And I expect that in your summation you are going
2   to argue the same.
3            And I don't think the People are going to dispute
4   that, because they can't.
5            So, but I think to take it to the next level and
6   actually give an instruction from the bench is taking it too
7   far, and I don't think it's necessary.

11   offered for its truth.
12            And so, we broke this out in terms of documents
13   that came in in that fashion on witness testimony.
14            I think that with respect to the documents, we are
15   largely in agreement.

17   meaning there was testimony from Hope Hicks and from
18   Mr. Cohen about public reactions and responses to the Access
19   Hollywood tape.
20            Our position is that the only basis for that
21   testimony to come in was not for its truth, but rather for
22   its impact on the listener.
23            Here, I assume the Government's theory is that
24   President Trump necessarily was one of the listeners, and
25   they're going to make arguments about how he reacted to

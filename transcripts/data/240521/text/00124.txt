Charge Conference

1   money payments are not inherently illegal.
2            I think that the logic of this type of instruction
3   is similar to the limiting instruction that we discussed
4   earlier about what intent to defraud does not mean.
5            This is, I think, something that is
6   straightforward, and should be clarified to the jury so that
7   they're not misled by the use of certain terms that both
8   sides are going to use in their arguments and fairly so.
9            We think it should be clear to the jury that hush
10   money alone is not illegal.
11            MR. STEINGLASS:  What the Defense is asking is
12   for you to make their arguments for them within the jury
13   charge.
14            They can argue whatever they want, as long as it's
15   a reasonable view of the evidence.
16            They can certainly say this to the jury, if they
17   want, but it's totally inappropriate for the Court to
18   marshal the evidence in a way that just makes the
19   defendant's argument for him.
20            THE COURT:  I think this came up numerous times
21   during the course of the trial.
22            I think several witnesses were asked that question
23   several times.
24            The answer was always:  It's not illegal.  It's not
25   a crime.

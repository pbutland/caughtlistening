Charge Conference
4348
1 MR. COLANGELO: We heard that the disagreement
2 here is that for a violation of the criminal law of FECA,
3 it must be willful, but the willfulness standard is not
4 required for other violations of FECA.
5 We oppose including that additional language
6 here, because the Election Law 17—152 violation occurs:
7 "When two or more people conspired to promote someone's
8 election to a public office by unlawful means." Those are
9 the terms of the Election Law 17—152 statute. And by its
10 plain meaning, "unlawful" doesn't mean criminal. It means
11 violation of law.
12 There are cases holding as much, including People
13 v. Ivybrooke Equity Enterprises, 175 A.D.3d 1000.
14 And the Court of Appeals has long held that when
15 the legislature intends to make —— intends to refer to a
16 crime, it knows how to do so.
17 (Whereupon, Mr. Steinglass whispers to Mr.
18 Colangelo.)
19 MR. COLANGELO: Ivybrooke. I—V—Y—B—R—O—O—K—E.
20 So, the legislature could have enacted the
21 statute that referred to a conspiracy to promote or
22 prevent election by criminal means, but, instead, it chose
23 the word "unlawful".
24 Mr. Bove mentioned the case People v. Wisan.
25 Unless we missed it, I'm not sure it was briefed

Charge Conference

1   means" and didn't.
2            There's two other points I would make in quick
3   response. One -- to what Mr. Bove just said.
4            One is that, more broadly, your Honor, and as you
5   previewed yesterday, and as you may have seen from our
6   proposed FECA charge, we think there's value, as you
7   indicated, in tailoring the "unlawful means" instructions
8   more narrowly and more concisely than in our original
9   proposal.
10            One of the reasons for that, as the Court held in
11   denying the Defendant's Omnibus Motions to dismiss, the
12   falsifying business records offense is committed when the
13   Defendant has the intent to defraud, that includes the
14   intent to commit or aid or conceal in the commission of
15   another crime.
16            But, the object crime doesn't need to be
17   completed, and there are cases the Court has cited where
18   the Defendant was acquitted of the object crime.
19            So, because we're now talking about -- and one
20   element of the predicate of the charged offense -- we
21   think it makes more sense for the Court not to burden the
22   jury with excessive verbiage we don't think is necessary
23   for the jury to accept what's necessary here.
24            MR. BOVE:  This is a big one for us.
25            THE COURT:  Sure.

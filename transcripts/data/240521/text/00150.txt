Charge Conference
4445
1            There is only one word that we disagree with in
2   this entire charge and that is the mens rea requirement.
3            So accessorial liability accomplice, of course, to
4   the FBR charge -- and you know we very much disagree with,
5   but understand Mr. Bove's argument about willfully as it
6   applies to the FECA.
7            We oppose that, and your Honor has held that in
8   abeyance, but under no circumstances should the accessorial
9   liability charge be read with the mens rea of willfully
10   because it applies to the FBR charge.
11            And the only mens rea in the FBR charge is
12   intentionally.
13            So, the correct mens rea for that charge should be
14   intentionally not willfully.
15            MR. BOVE:  The CJI charge, the model charge that
16   we're talking about lists as examples intentionally,
17   recklessly, with criminal negligence.
18            I don't believe that to be an exhaustive list of
19   the options we've talked a lot about the willfully mens rea
20   today.
21            You have our position.
22            THE COURT:  Thank you.
23            MR. STEINGLASS:  And, lastly, Judge, there was --
24   and I'm not casting any aspersions here.
25            And I will hand a copy up to the Court, and I have

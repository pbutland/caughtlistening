Charge Conference
4362
1            Why don't we just leave in that very last
2   sentence, which sums it up? I think it sums it up very
3   well.
4            If the payment would have been made, even in the
5   absence of the candidacy, the payment should not be
6   treated as a contribution.
7            MR. BOVE:  I think that that is an accurate
8   restatement or summary of the "irrespective rule"; and I
9   think the way it is different there, the Government's
10   proposal is that it -- in yellow, is that it does not
11   invite a mixed motive analysis; and that's why the last
12   one is accurate, the one we put forward.
13            We do think, as your Honor noted, this is an area
14   that is technical and somewhat confusing.
15            This is something that -- we understand the
16   Court's ruling -- that we would have sought to do through
17   the expert.
18            We are asking your Honor to provide examples so
19   the jury has a picture -- again, we're not asking to you
20   make up examples.
21            We didn't make up examples.
22            We're really trying to, quote, carefully -- and
23   if we missed a word or two, let's fix it -- but get this
24   very carefully from things the FEC said before.
25            MR. COLANGELO:  A couple of things.

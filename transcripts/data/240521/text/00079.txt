Charge Conference
4374
1            THE COURT:  E-L-E-E-M-O-S-Y-N-A-R-Y.  Which means
2   charity.  But we'll move to strike it.
3            Let's go down to the next one.
4            For the definition of intent, the People propose
5   to add, "Thus, a person acts with intent to defraud, when
6   his or her conscious objective or purpose is to do so."
7            The defense suggests, "Thus, a person acts with
8   intent to defraud, when his or her conscious objective or
9   purpose is to lead another into error or to disadvantage."
10            MR. COLANGELO:  Thank you, your Honor.
11            So, the first sentence your Honor just read is not
12   the People's proposal.  That is verbatim from the CJI
13   charge.
14            As the Court just said, that's the pattern charge
15   for a reason.  We think there is absolutely no basis for
16   deviating from it in this case.
17            The second sentence the Court read, the defense
18   proposal, is a citation from the language from the Practice
19   Commentary, but even that Practice Commentary citation
20   refers to a concurring opinion in a court case that talks
21   about what intent to defraud has been suggested to be
22   defined as.
23            And, so, we just think there is really no reason
24   at all to alter the standard practice.  We think the Court
25   should stick with the standard charge for the definition of

Charge Conference

1   predicate offense in civil terms, and put President Trump
2   in a position where this jury could convict him based on a
3   flawed finding of some kind of intent to conceal a civil
4   conspiracy can elevate a civil misdemeanor charge up to a
5   felony.
6            That's a very serious concern for us.
7            That's why, starting with the FECA charge, we
8   requested your Honor instruct the jury in terms of
9   criminal offenses.
10            And, here, the FECA offense requires a "willful"
11   mens rea.
12            That's consistent, Judge -- last one -- with the
13   way that the Government has requested instructions on the
14   Federal tax predicate that they're seeking instructions
15   on.
16            If you look at Page 6 of the Government's
17   request, they ask for a "willfully" instruction with
18   respect to that charge.
19            So, I think it's also consistent with their
20   request.
21            But, even if they hadn't made that request, it's
22   critical for -- to make sure that the jury knows and is
23   required to find that the predicate of the 175.10 charge
24   is a criminal offense, and if the object isn't criminal,
25   then we're stuck with a civil conspiracy.

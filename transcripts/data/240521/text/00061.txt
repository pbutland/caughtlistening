1            So, this "clearly and unambiguously related to"
2   test, as I think Mr. Bove acknowledged, only has arisen in
3   a separate context of regulations in expressive advocacy.
4   So, it's the proposed importation of a different test from
5   an entirely different context.
6            Even the case he cited, the Fourth Circuit case,
7   North Carolina Right to Life v. Leake, L-E-A-K-E, we
8   believe has been either overruled or substantially
9   aggregated by a subsequent Fourth Circuit decision, Real
10   Truth Against Abortion, 681 F.3d 544.
11            It's not even clear at all this is a viable test
12   in the limited context in the Regulations on expressive
13   advocacy.
14            In any event, your Honor, it's not necessary to
15   define this term for a couple of other reasons.
16            One. As we discussed, we think the jury needs
17   less, not more, on FECA instructions; and we think the
18   term "for the purpose of influencing any election" is a
19   pretty straight-forward term that jurors can understand.
20            Second. We think to the extent the Court defines
21   the "irrespective of the candidacy" test, which we're
22   going to talk about, that test is going to be the test for
23   determining whether an individual third-party's payments
24   of a candidate's personal expenses, whether that's a
25   contribution or not.

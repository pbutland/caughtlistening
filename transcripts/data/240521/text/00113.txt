6            MR. COLANGELO:  Thank you, your Honor.
7            As we understand it, the Defense objection to
8   including this charge at all is that I believe the Defense

12   argument along those lines.

14   and the documentary evidence, including Weisselberg's
15   handwritten notes on the Essential Consultants' bank

17   contemporaneous handwritten notes, People's 36, the record
18   shows that part of the intended concealment here was to
19   camouflage the reimbursement as income so it wouldn't be
20   noticed. And in order to camouflage it as income or as a
21   consequence of camouflaging it as income, they doubled it,
22   they grossed it up for tax purposes.
23            Weisselberg and McConney even wrote down "grossed
24   up" on People's 35, "times two for taxes" on People's 36.
25   So, falsely identifying corporate payment as

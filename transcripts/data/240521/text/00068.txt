Charge Conference
4363
1            We agree with the Court that the first three
2   sentences in blue are, both, confusing and extraneous.
3   They describe circumstances that aren't present in this
4   case. We're not talking about campaign expenses paid for
5   by a campaign, so we think they're confusing and
6   extraneous.
7            Mr. Bove has opposed the sentence highlighted in
8   yellow in that it suggests a subjective test.
9            That is a motion we briefed at the Motion in
10   Limine stage, and we gave the Court two pages of authority
11   for looking at whether a payment would have been made
12   irrespective of a candidacy is a subjective test. That's
13   how you determine whether a payment would be made
14   irrespective of the candidacy or not. You have to look at
15   the reasons.
16            And these authorities are cited in our Opposition
17   to the Defendant's Motions in Limine at Page 13 to 14.
18   That's a document we filed on February 29th.
19            We think the "it's subjective" evaluation is the
20   way that Regulation is applied.
21            So, for that reason, we think the sentence that
22   the People proposed is the better explanation of the
23   "irrespective" test than the final sentence in that
24   paragraph that the Defense proposed.
25            If the Court is inclined to go with the final

5   BY MR. BOVE:
6                MR. BOVE:  Mr. Bernik, can we please take a look at
7        Government Exhibit 512Q in evidence.
8                 I'm sorry, if I could ask the Government to help me
9        out with that one.
10                Thank you.
11                MS. HOFFINGER:  That's a People's Exhibit?
12                MR. BOVE:  Yes.
13                Thank you.
14                MS. HOFFINGER:  You're welcome.
15                (Displayed.)
16                MR. BOVE:  And if we could zoom in on the email,
17       please.
18                (Displayed.)
19       Q    And, so, Mr. Costello, this is an email that Michael
20   Cohen sent to you and some others on August 8th; correct?
21       A    That is correct.
22       Q    And do you see where he wrote in the first sentence:
23   "Please cease contacting me as you do not and have never
24   represented me in this or any other matter."
25       Do you see that?

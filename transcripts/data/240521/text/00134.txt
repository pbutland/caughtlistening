Charge Conference
4429
1 We do not intend to suggest that Michael Cohen's
2 guilty plea or that AMI's Nonâ€”Pros Agreement is evidence of
3 the defendant's guilt, but it is relevant to more than
4 credibility.
5 That's what your Honor's limiting instruction that,
6 I believe the Defense drafted, said.
7 And we think that you should give that same
8 instruction and that we should be able to make the arguments
9 that you have allowed us to make and not make the arguments
10 that you have not allowed us to make.
11 And we do not intend to make the arguments that you
12 have not allowed us to make.
13 THE COURT: My intention right now is to give
14 substantially the same instruction that I gave during the
15 trial.
16 MR. BOVE: Understood. We are concerned about what
17 was just said.
18 In terms of the potential for arguments that go
19 beyond just the extent to which these agreements and
20 documents bear on Pecker's credibility and Cohen's
21 credibility.
22 Anything that gets near this line, Judge, with the
23 jury in summations would be extraordinarily prejudicial and
24 so we would hope that the People will be extremely
25 conservative in their approach on this.

Charge Conference
4444
1   liability charge that we sent around.
2            And I believe it was a joint submission this
3   afternoon.
4            I wanted to point out two quick things about it.
5   First of all, it's maybe a little bit difficult to
6   understand the way this was done.
7            But, for example, if your Honor looks on Page 1
8   and 2.
9            Do you have a copy of it with you or I have an
10   extra copy?
11            THE COURT:  Direct me to what time that came
12   through?
13            MR. STEINGLASS:  I have no idea.
14            THE COURT:  I think it was this afternoon?
15            MR. STEINGLASS:  It was this afternoon.  I will
16   just hand up a copy.
17            (Handed.)
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  So, I just want to make it clear,
19   we crossed out the note, as appropriate.
20            That's because we both agree that that language
21   should be given.
22            That's on Page 1 and Page 2, where the optional
23   language is there, that we both agree that it should be
24   given.
25            That's what crossing out the note means.

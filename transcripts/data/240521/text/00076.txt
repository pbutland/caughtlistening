4            THE COURT:  I think what we can do is, strike the
5   convicted of language.  Leave participated in.
6            If the defendant in any way tries to take
7   advantage of that ruling by arguing on summation that he
8   was convicted of these two other crimes, and not convicted
9   of this other one, then you can certainly argue that the
10   door has been opened.  You could then -- or I could add
11   this language to my instructions.
12            MR. BOVE:  I think as you flagged, this issue is
13   also extremely important to us that the limiting
14   instruction that you have given in making sure that in
15   summation we don't open the door to changing that limiting
16   instruction, and also policing the line that the Government
17   is not arguing anything is traversing it.
18            Here, I think the correct thing to do would be to
19   just make our crime -- where we have singular -- make it
20   plural.
21            And part of the reason is it's not the two FECA
22   violations.
23            It's the Government's theory that Mr. Cohen
24   participated in the 34 charged crimes, and so, crimes
25   plural is accurate and wouldn't draw undue attention to the

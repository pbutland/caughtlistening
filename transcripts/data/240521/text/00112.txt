Charge Conference

1   the facts of the case.
2            But, where there's no obligation to identify even
3   the object crime, there is no reason to be held to the
4   proof standard of the object crime.
5            What we have to prove is the Defendant's intent
6   and the intent to aid or conceal.
7            MR. BOVE:  Mackey had to come up at least once at
8   this conference.
9            Look. There's a very significant difference
10   between the facts in Mackey and a burglary charge, where
11   the Court of Appeals said there can be evidence of
12   criminal intent of the fact of the entry, the manner in
13   which the burglary happened.
14            This is not that case.
15            And your Honor has discretion here.
16            The really important issue is: The predicate that
17   the Government is moving forward on requires proof of
18   unlawful means.
19            The jury cannot infer that the predicate is
20   established just by the fact that there was an agreement
21   to promote President Trump's election in 2016.
22            Of course there was. He won.
23            They have to establish some kind of unlawful
24   means to make that a crime.
25            That makes this very different from Mackey.

Charge Conference

1            So, we don't need an additional gloss on some
2   other language that is, otherwise, already clear on that
3   space.
4            THE COURT:  So, what you're suggesting is that
5   paragraph simply read: The terms "contribution" and
6   "expenditure" include anything of value, including any
7   purchase, payment, loan, or advance made by any person for
8   the purpose of influencing any election for Federal
9   office; period?
10            MR. COLANGELO:  Correct, your Honor. That's the
11   People's request.
12            THE COURT:  I agree.
13            I think that the concerns that you have, that
14   you're expressing, will be expressed in other areas of the
15   charge.
16            I think that here it becomes confusing.
17            Some of the issues are confusing enough, I think.
18            We want to make it as easy as possible for the
19   jury.
20            Let's go down to the next paragraph.
21            Here, the People made a request. It says that: A
22   candidate for Federal Office does not have to be the sole
23   or only motivation for the third-party's payment, so long
24   as the payment would not have been made but for the
25   candidate's status as a candidate for Federal Office.

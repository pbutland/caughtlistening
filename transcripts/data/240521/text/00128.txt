Charge Conference

1   endorsement and what impact that had on the defendant so I
2   think that this charge is confusing.
3            I think it's unnecessary.
4            I think it retroactively limits the evidence.  And,
5   you know, I'm not even quite sure what prejudice the
6   defendant is seeking to cure here.
7            MR. BOVE:  We are seeking to be precise with the
8   jury about the admissible bases for which evidence came in
9   at the trial.
10            And I didn't object when Ms. Hicks was testifying.
11   I explained why I didn't object.
12            There was one permissible basis for this testimony,
13   and I think Mr. Steinglass just described it.
14            Except he also described a factual assertion by
15   Senator McCain, and that factual assertion doesn't come in
16   for its truth, the fact that he was withdrawing his support.
17   That's my point.
18            This should not be controversial.  It comes in for
19   its impact on President Trump; and that's what this says.
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  I'm not quite sure that that's
21   what the instruction that they are suggesting says, but
22   we can all agree that the evidence of the reaction of
23   others is coming in for its impact on the defendant, and his
24   state of mind and the impetus to lock up the Stormy Daniels
25   story.

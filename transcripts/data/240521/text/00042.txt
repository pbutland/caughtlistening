1                THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.
2                You can step down.
3                (Witness excused.)
4                  **********
5                THE COURT:  Counsel?
6                MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, the Defense rests.
7                THE COURT:  People?
8                MR. STEINGLASS:  Nothing further, Judge.
9                THE COURT:  Okay.
10                Jurors, as you've just heard, the People rested
11       yesterday.
12                The Defense just rested today.
13                So, what normally happens at this point is that you
14       will hear the summations of the attorneys; the summations
15       are then followed by my instructions to you on the law; and
16       then you will begin your deliberations.
17                In a case like this, which is a rather long case,
18       summations will not be quick.
19                I expect that the summations will take, for both
20       attorneys, they will take at least a day.
21                I expect that my instructions will take at least an
22       hour.
23                My belief is that it's always ideal or best not to
24       break up summations.  I prefer that the jury hear both
25       summations at the same time, if at all possible.

2       Q    This is from Robert Costello, Wednesday, June 13th,
3   2018, to Michael Cohen.
4       Michael, since you jumped off the phone rather abruptly,
5   I did not get a chance to tell you that my friend has
6   communicated to me that he is meeting with his client this
7   evening.
8       And he added that if there was anything that you wanted to
9   convey, you should tell me, and my friend will bring it up for
10   discussion this evening.
11       Weren't you encouraging Michael Cohen there to send any
12   message he wanted to the President through Rudy Giuliani; isn't
13   that right?
14       A    I was encouraging Michael Cohen, as I just explained to
15   you in my previous answer, to express any of his complaints --
16   and he had several -- so that I could bring them to Giuliani and
17   get them worked out, whatever they were.
18       Q    Okay.
19                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Let's take a look at the last
20        paragraph, please.

22       Q    Please remember that if you want or need to
23   communicate something, please let me know and I will see that it
24   gets done.
25       I hope I am wrong but it seems to both Jeff and I that

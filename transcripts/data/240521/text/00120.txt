Charge Conference
4415
1            At the end I will be clear with you about what
2   documents applies to each count so that they understand
3   beforehand what applies to each count; and this is so that
4   they can understand -- it's very abundantly in an excess of
5   caution, so that they understand that everything you're
6   saying applies to each count.
7            MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, our proposal was drawn
8   from charges that this Court has given in other cases and
9   was based on our understanding of the Court's typical
10   practice of reciting the elements of the offense at the end
11   of a recitation of multiple counts where there are many
12   consecutive counts.
13            I'm not sure we have a strong view one way or the
14   other.
15            If the Court thinks that there is a more artful way
16   to do it, we obviously would not object.
17            THE COURT:  I -- I think the proposal that we have
18   right now would lay out the elements right at the beginning
19   before count 1, and then right at the end, after count 34.
20            I have no problem giving the instruction you are
21   requesting as well.
22            That's fine.
23            Okay.  Let's take ten minutes.
24            (Recess taken.)

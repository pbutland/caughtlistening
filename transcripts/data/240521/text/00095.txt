1   conspiracy.  That is the New York Election Law 17-152
2   predicate.
3            So, under those circumstances where the jury is
4   being asked to evaluate, not only intent to defraud, but
5   the present intent with respect to in coed promise, that
6   this bears emphasis in the same way that your Honor seems
7   inclined to place some emphasis on the other parts of the
8   175.10 instruction that we just went through.  This is an
9   issue we feel was appropriate.
10            MR. COLANGELO:  This proposed language is
11   inconsistent with the text of the statute, which says,
12   "That a person is guilty of falsifying business records in
13   the first degree, when he commits the crime of falsifying
14   business records in the second degree, and when his intent
15   to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to
16   aid or conceal the commission thereof."
17            There is nothing in the statute about two separate
18   intents.  The Donnino Commentary doesn't cite any cases
19   regarding charging language of how the jury is supposed to
20   understand the statute, and the text of this statute alone,
21   contemplating the notion that the same set of facts could
22   satisfy both intents.
23            Obviously, we agree that the People have to
24   establish two elements, an intent to defraud and that the
25   intent to defraud includes an intent to commit or conceal

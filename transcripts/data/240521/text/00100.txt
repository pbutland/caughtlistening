1        that both have that wilfulness mens rea.
2                 And so, our position is that that needs to be
3        imported up into the 17-152 mens rea.  That is, the mental
4        state required to join the conspiracy.
5                 Our cite, this is in Footnote 25 of our request to
6        charge, People versus Caban, C-A-B-A-N, New York Court of
7        Appeals, 2005.  This is an individual who is prosecuted for
8        conspiracy and necessarily is an individual that must have
9        the prescribed mens rea, the requisite intent to join
10        others and commit a substantive crime.
11                 So that second sentence from Caban, we submit, is
12        controlling here.
13                 So, because the object of the unlawful activity
14        under 17-152 must be criminal -- and we're going to have
15        this argument in a little bit, we don't think that the tax
16        predicate should go to the jury.
17                 But, if it does, it will have this wilfully
18        requirement, same with respect to FECA.  So, we think when
19        you are describing this Election Law Conspiracy, for you to
20        be describing a crime, a potentially valid predicate to
21        elevate the charges to a felony, it has to have this wilful
22        language.

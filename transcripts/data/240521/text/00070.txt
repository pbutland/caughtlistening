1 MR. BOVE: That would be fine with us.
2 Thank you.
3 MR. COLANGELO: So, your Honor, we definitely
4 agree with striking the argumentative sentence regarding
5 the "broad concept".
6 We think the other language that the Court just
7 read into the record and that we highlighted in blue is
8 unnecessary for a couple of reasons.
9 First, we think, again, "normal and legitimate
10 press function", especially against the facts that have
11 already been elicited during this trial, is a concept that
12 the jury will be likely to understand without unnecessary
13 additional instruction and that the parties can argue on
14 summations. We're not sure any further explanation of that
15 term is necessary.
16 If it is, the problem with the last sentence here
17 —— which we acknowledge is drawn from the fact—pattern in
18 one of the cases cited in the footnote. The problem with
19 that last sentence is a little bit confusing because it
20 has nothing to do with the circumstances of this case.
21 "Sending solicitation letters", "seeking new
22 subscribers", it's hard to see how that explains to the
23 jury what a normal, legitimate press function is.
24 If we're going to be giving examples, it seems
25 odd to select that one over other ones, including, for

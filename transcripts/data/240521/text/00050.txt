Charge Conference
4345
1 submissions I received today, so I can hear you further on
2 your respected positions.
3 Let's start with the proposal instructions on
4 FECA.
5 On the first paragraph, I see that the Defense
6 requested the word "willfully" be added twice.
7 Can I hear from you on that?
8 MR. BOVE: Yes, your Honor.
9 Our position on FECA, here, because of the way
10 its positioned in the Government's theory of the case,
11 meaning no longer a predicate on the business records
12 count but now an unlawful activity as an object of the New
13 York Election Law conspiracy, that the FECA predicate in
14 that position, it has to be a criminal FECA violation.
15 Because a conspiracy to violate New York Election Law,
16 it's only a crime if it has a criminal object.
17 If it's a nonâ€”criminal violation, you're talking,
18 I submit, about a civil conspiracy, at most.
19 This is an issue, both, at the FECA level and
20 then when we talk about that one predicate charge that's
21 very, very important to us, which is New York Business Law
22 175.10 requires intent to either commit or conceal another
23 crime.
24 That other crime, now we know, is New York
25 Election Law.

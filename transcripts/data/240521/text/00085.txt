Charge Conference

1            MR. COLANGELO:  I don't think it's duplicative of
2   that, irrespective of the accessorial concept.  There is a
3   threshold definitional question about what it means to
4   cause a false entry.
5            So, we think acting in concert does not, in fact,
6   capture this issue.  The defendant causes false entries
7   when he sets this scheme in motion and that's a reasonably
8   foreseeable consequence of that action.
9            MR. BOVE:  Judge, the Miles case that we're
10   talking about is a sufficiency analysis after the fact.
11   It doesn't support providing instruction.  That, as your
12   Honor said, would be duplicative.
13            I think really the central issue is, you cannot
14   de-couple the accessorial liability mens rea and just give
15   this instruction here without that.
16            This whole thing is required.  That is what the
17   jury needs to find to return a verdict.
18            THE COURT:  I will reserve decision on that.
19            Right now my inclination is to strike that
20   language from the charges.
21            Looking at the expanded charge of intent, why does
22   the defense oppose the entire charge?
23            MR. BOVE:  We are just following your Honor's less
24   is more guidance on this one.
25            THE COURT:  So, we'll leave it.  I think it's an

Charge Conference

1            MR. BOVE:  I don't think it accomplishes it for
2   purposes of a conspiracy, Judge.
3            They are similar concepts, "mere presence".
4            But, I think to protect our rights, they bear
5   repeating, what we're introducing is a distinct concept:
6   There's the criminal conspiracy predicate here. There's
7   the same from the accessorial criminal liability that
8   could give a conviction in 175.10.
9            THE COURT:  What's the harm of including that?
10            We're including accessorial liability. This
11   section includes conspiracy. Why not include it there?
12            MR. COLANGELO:  It would mislead the jury for two
13   reasons.
14            The first, as we addressed in the briefing and
15   the Court's decision, for months, the Defendant himself
16   doesn't need to have committed this crime to have
17   culpability under the FBR charge. It's if he concealed the
18   admission of someone else's crime.
19            It's confusing to instruct the jury of the
20   import of his mere presence when, if the facts show
21   after-the-fact he decided to conceal it, it would also be
22   an FBR violation.
23            The second reason is the trial record doesn't
24   support an argument of mere presence.

Charge Conference

1 THE COURT: Just to be clear, I'm reserving
2 decision on the "willfully" issue.
3 On the issue —— we're speaking about, now, the
4 2015 and 2016 limits —— I don't think that's necessary. I

6 evidence here that requires that instruction.
7 You're certainly free to argue on summation that
8 if your client has certain wealth, he could have certainly
9 paid for this himself.
10 But, I don't think that that needs to come from
11 the bench, so I'm going to strike that.
12 Going down to the next paragraph, this is also a
13 Defense—disputed request.
14 The phrase, quote, "the purpose of influencing an
15 election," closed quote, requires proof that the activity
16 clearly and unambiguously related to President Trump's
17 2016 campaign.
18 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.
19 So, you have the authorities we've cited in
20 support of that: the Leake case, L—E—A—K—E, Orloski, and
21 Wisconsin Right to Life.
22 Our position here is that this type of
23 instruction is necessary to make clear to the jury that
24 there is a zone of First—Amendment—protected activity
25 involved in this analysis, and what the Supreme Court has

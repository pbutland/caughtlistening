Charge Conference
4373
1   it  names the accomplice.  So I will just take the CJI and
2   refer to him thereafter as accomplice.
3            THE COURT:  You should know going forward for the
4   rest of this conference and beyond, where there is standard
5   pattern jury instructions, I don't deviate.  If there is
6   really a good reason, I will, but I won't just for the sake
7   of it.  A lot of really smart people put a lot of hard work
8   into coming up with those instructions.  There is no reason
9   to mess with it.
10            So if here the language is accomplice, that's what
11   we'll go with.
12            Okay.  All right.
13            Let's look at the joint submission that came in at
14   is 11:26.
15            Let's begin with the most challenging submission
16   facing all of us, which is how you pronounce this word,
17   "eleemosynary."  I've said it one hundred times and I still
18   can't get it right.
19            MR. STEINGLASS:  You won't get any help from us.
20            THE COURT:  My suggestion would be, why do we even
21   have it.  I don't think we need it.  It's not relevant to
22   the facts of this case.
23            Can we just delete it?
24            MR. STEINGLASS:  No objection.
25            COURT REPORTER:  Can you spell that, please.

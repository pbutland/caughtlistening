Charge Conference
4448
1   cross-examination, on Pages 1896 through 1897 in the
2   transcript.
3            "QUESTION:  And that engagement, that
4   attorney-client engagement was not committed to writing; was
5   it?"
6            "ANSWER:  It was not."
7            "QUESTION:  And there is nothing wrong with that;
8   is there?"
9            "ANSWER:  There is not."
10            "QUESTION:  That's an ethical practice to have an
11   attorney-client relationship without an engagement letter;
12   right?"
13            "ANSWER:  Yes."
14            So, as I said, I'm not ascribing any bad motives to
15   the Defense team, but those are just misstatements of the
16   law.
17            And I think that it is incumbent upon your Honor to
18   cure those misperceptions of the law.
19            And I do have a copy.
20            It's somewhere in here.
21            THE COURT:  Thank you.
22            MR. STEINGLASS:  Of both of the New York City Rules
23   and Regulations as well as some case law that interprets
24   them.
25            (Handed.)

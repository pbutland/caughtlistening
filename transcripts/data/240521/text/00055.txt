1   relied on the CJI instructions, the conspiracy in the
2   sixth degree instruction that we relied upon, I think, is

20   violation when any two or more persons conspire to promote
21   someone's election by unlawful means.
22            So, the crime is established through the
23   formation of a conspiracy and its execution through
24   unlawful means.

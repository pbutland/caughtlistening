Charge Conference

1   charge.
2            MR. STEINGLASS:  And just to clarify, we are fine
3   with the limiting instruction that you gave during the
4   trial.
5            The language that the Defense is proposing in their
6   submission is outrageous.
7            Such as:  AMI did not admit to any violations of
8   the law in those agreements.
9            This is not the limiting instruction that you gave;
10   this is an argument.
11            THE COURT:  I'm not commenting on the language that
12   the defense has suggested.
13            MR. STEINGLASS:  Okay.
14            MR. BOVE:  I wasn't trying to be outrageous.
15            The reason that we put that in the proposal, Judge,
16   and it was queued up in the Government's response, is that
17   there was a comment at sidebar about whether or not the
18   non-pros is evidence of a violation of FECA by AMI.
19            Our concern gets back to the purpose of the
20   limiting instruction in the first place.
21            There is a suggestion in the Government's reply to
22   our request, that there is some kind of dispute that the
23   jury needs to evaluate about whether -- what that non-pros
24   reflects and whether it reflects a violation.
25            We think that type of argument would be wholly

R. Costello - Cross/Hoffinger
4300
1   interest and offers to become a part of "the team" and to serve
2   as a contact was subject to existing counsel, Guy Petrillo's
3   cc'd approval, which was denied.
4       Now, the subject line says "Statement of Account;" correct,
5   Mr. Costello?
6       A    That's correct.
7       Q    And that means you were sending him bills; right?
8       A    Not with this email.
9       I think he had been provided a bill by the Billing
10   Department.
11       Q    And, in reply, he was replying to a statement of
12   account that you had sent him?
13       A    That's what it appears to be, yes.
14       Q    And you were upset that he had not paid you; right?
15       A    I did -- I was.  We also replied to this --
16       Q    Okay.  Thank you.
17       A    -- which you have.
18       Q    Now, let's go back to your first meeting with Mr. Cohen
19   at the Regency Hotel on April 17th, 2018; okay?
20       A    Right.
21       Q    You discussed with him, at that very first meeting, how
22   connected you were to Rudy Giuliani; correct?
23       A    That's not true.
24       Q    Well, didn't you tell him at the first meeting that
25   your relationship with Rudy Giuliani would be useful to him?

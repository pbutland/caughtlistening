1   trial that the witness omitted to state at a prior time."
2            MR. STEINGLASS:  I think that was an inadvertent
3   submission on our part.  I think we both agreed on that.
4            There is one part of the credibility charge I
5   think we have just agreed that we're also in agreement
6   about, the second disputed paragraph, which is one about
7   the witness testifying falsely.  I think defense has
8   withdrawn that language, that requested language as well.
9            MR. BOVE:  We're withdrawing it because we were
10   not permitted to and did not elicit from Mr. Cohen Judge
11   Pauley's findings, so we understand.
12            THE COURT:  Looking at the submission that I
13   received today at 1:05, beginning with the Election Law
14   Section 17-152 predicate, the People are proposing language

16   conduct be performed, that will promote or prevent the
17   person from public office by unlawful means, when his or
18   her conscious objective or purpose is that such conduct be
19   performed."
20            The defense is suggesting language that reads,
21   "Thus, a person acts with intent of conduct constituting a
22   crime be performed, when the person acts willfully that a
23   conscious objective or purpose that such conduct be
24   performed."

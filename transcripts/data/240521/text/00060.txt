Charge Conference

1 done to carve out First Amendmentâ€”protected activity from

4 So, we think it's necessary for the jury to
5 understand that point, so that we can make arguments
6 around the fact of people's mental state as they were
7 thinking about these things in 2016, they would have
8 understood this type of restriction and that it was
9 required that the things they were doing be in clear
10 violation of the FECA Regulations and Provisions we're
11 talking about.
12 This is an accurate statement of the law. It's
13 describing a phrase that I think Buckley in the Supreme
14 Court said is ambiguous.
15 This is the kind of thing that we would have done
16 through Mr. Smith.
17 We understand the Court's ruling.
18 But, this is the type of content we were seeking
19 to provide to the jury about what these phrases mean.
20 So, we're asking your Honor do it in your
21 province of instructing the jury on the law.
22 MR. COLANGELO: We think this is not an accurate
23 statement of the law and is, in any event, both irrelevant
24 and superseded by other instructions we think the Court
25 will give.

1   to your partner, Jeff Citron, the same day, on April 19th,
2   subject line, "Rudy Giuliani to join Trump's legal team?"
3       A    Yes, I do.
4       Q    And you provided that email to our Office; correct?
5       A    Absolutely, correct.  More than a year ago.
6                MS. HOFFINGER:  I offer in evidence now People's
7       512E.
8                MR. BOVE:  No objection.

10       into evidence.
11                (So marked in evidence.)
12                *********
13       Q    And so, this is your -- I'm going to read to you --
14   read to the jury from your email to Jeffrey Citron, April 19th,
15   2018.
16       You sent a link from Fox News that said "Rudy Giuliani to
17   join Trump team."
18       Here is your email to your partner, Jeffrey Citron:
19       All the more reason for Cohen to hire me because of my
20   connection to Giuliani, which I mentioned to him in our meeting.
21        That was your email; correct?
22       A    Correct.
23       Q    Now, you continued to tell Mr. Cohen, did you not, that
24   your relationship with Rudy Giuliani would provide him with a
25   back channel of communications to President Trump; isn't that

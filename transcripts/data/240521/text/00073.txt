Charge Conference

1   press function is a broad concept"; right?
2            MR. BOVE:  No, your Honor.
3            THE COURT:  All right.
4            That's how we're going to go with that one.
5            Turning to the submission regarding "accomplice
6   as a matter of law", it really comes down to the same
7   thing, three times over again, of the Defense is
8   requesting that the phrase "participated in the crime" be
9   used and that the name "Cohen" be used.
10            The People are requesting that the term
11   "participated in" and "was convicted of two crimes" be
12   used and, also, the phrase "the accomplice".
13            Why do you think we need to add "and convicted of
14   two crimes"?
15            MR. STEINGLASS:  That language is straight out of
16   the CJI.  It's bracketed language. Not the "two crimes".
17   It says "convicted of a crime".
18            In this case, it's two crimes.
19            If you want to make it single, that's fine.
20            I thought it was misleading to make it only one.
21            That's bracketed language, and the way I read the
22   bracketed language in the CJI is it's to be given if it's
23   applicable.
24            THE COURT:  Okay.
25            Why don't we just give "participated in"?

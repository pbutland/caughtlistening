Charge Conference
4370
1   somebody had been convicted -- an accomplice had been
2   convicted of a crime, which would render the language
3   completely superfluous.
4            THE COURT:  Let's talk about this case.
5            MR. STEINGLASS:  As your Honor pointed out, you
6   have instructed the jury several times about the proper
7   use of that guilty plea and improper use of that guilty
8   plea.
9            We have no objection to you doing that again as
10   part of the charge, to re-reading that limiting
11   instruction.
12            But, I think the evidence is more in this case
13   than just "participated in". It's "participated in and
14   convicted of".  And I think that's what the CJI
15   contemplates.

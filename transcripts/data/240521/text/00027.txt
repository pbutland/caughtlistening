R. Costello - Redirect/Bove
4322
1       A    I do.
2       Q    And I want to focus on the part of that sentence that
3   reads:  "Have never represented me."
4       Do you see that?
5       A    I do.
6       Q    From your perspective, was that true or false at the
7   time that Cohen said it?
8       A    False.
9                 MR. BOVE:  Now, I would like to next look at
10        Government Exhibit 504AT in evidence.
11                 I think we have this one.
12                 And I just want to look at the carry-over sentence
13        on Page 1 and 2.
14                 (Displayed.)
15       Q    Now, this is a Waiver signed by Michael Cohen, and I'm
16   focused on the sentence that begins, "Although."
17       Do you see that?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Do you see where it says:  "At no time did I sign a
20   retainer or otherwise agree to retain Costello."
21       Do you see that on Page 2?
22       A    I do.
23       Q    And do you see where it says:  "Otherwise agreed or
24   retained Costello?"
25       A    I do.

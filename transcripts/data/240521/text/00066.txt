Charge Conference
4361
1            MR. BOVE:  The next sentence, Judge, begins,
2   "There are a new number of issues," is a verbatim quote
3   from MUR 4944, which is an analyst by the FEC relating to
4   loans to the Clinton family that I think both sides have
5   cited. It's in the footnotes.
6            But, these are -- we're quoting nearly verbatim
7   from those authorities.
8            THE COURT:  Let me read it into the record.
9            There are a number of issues arising with a
10   candidate's personal situation that may become campaign
11   issues, that expenses arising from such controversies are
12   not necessarily campaign expenses.
13            The political impact of legal issues on a
14   campaign would not, by itself, justify the treatment of
15   any legal expenses as campaign related. Legal expenses are
16   not campaign related unless the underlying activities have
17   some impact on the campaign.
18            If the payment had been made in the absence of
19   the candidacy, the payment should not be treated as a
20   contribution.
21            It seems to me that that very last sentence that
22   you're proposing is very similar to the sentence that the
23   People are proposing above.
24            And the examples that you're providing in the
25   middle I find somewhat confusing.

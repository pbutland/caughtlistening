Charge Conference

1 If you want to go ahead and say something else, go
2 ahead.
3 MR. BOVE: 1 would, Judge.
4 Everything that was just said about Mr. Pecker's
5 intent and what he communicated to his attorney doesn't bear
6 on the argument that we want to make at all.
7 We are not suggesting that we —— our argument does
8 not rely on whether or not what Mr. Pecker said was
9 accurate.
10 Our argument relies on the fact that Mr. Pecker
11 said to Michael Cohen: "This is bulletproof."
12 That the fair inference from the "bulletproof"
13 comment is that it was legally vetted.
14 Whether and to what extent and how Mr. Pecker did
15 that doesn't bear on what was said to President Trump.
16 Mr. Cohen said to President Trump: I have been told that
17 the agreement was "bulletproof."
18 President Trump was entitled to draw an inference
19 from that when his own attorney is communicating it to him
20 that it had been property vetted.
21 It doesn't —— that argument doesn't depend on
22 Mr. Pecker being truthful with his attorneys.
23 THE COURT: All right. Look ——
24 MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, can I make an
25 additional argument?

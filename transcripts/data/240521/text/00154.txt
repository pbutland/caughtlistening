Charge Conference

1            MR. STEINGLASS:  And I will just cite those cases
2   for the record.
3            Give me one moment.
4            People -- well, the first and foremost case is
5   Seth Rubinstein PC versus Ganea, 41 AD 3d 54 Second
6   Department 2007.
7            There is also a matter of Brown 133 AD 3d 7 First
8   Department from 2015.
9            And Barry Mallin and Associates PC versus Nash
10   Metalware Co., Inc., 18 Misc. 3D 890.
11            That's a Civil Court of New York County case from
12   2008.
13            So, we believe that this instruction is necessary
14   to cure the erroneous impression left that there is nothing
15   improper about not having a written Retainer Agreement.
16            It is, in fact, the law.
17            MR. BOVE:  We don't think that's right, Judge.
18   First of all, the rule that was just cited, 1215.1, is
19   followed by 1215.2, which sets forth a series of exceptions,
20   including at subparagraph B, a situation where
21   representation with the attorneys' services are the same
22   kind as previously rendered and --
23            THE COURT:  Do you have a copy of that?
24            MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge, I do.
25            (Handed.)

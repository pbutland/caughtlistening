Charge Conference
4364
1 sentence in the Defense paragraph, we do think it would
2 need to refer to a third—party's payment, because those
3 are the circumstances we're talking about here; and that
4 sentence does not, right now, refer to if a third party
5 would have made the payment.
6 THE COURT: So, I'm going to reserve decision on
7 this.
8 But, right now, my inclination is that I'm
9 actually going to insert the People's sentence and your
10 last sentence. I think that they both work together.
11 And I'm going to remove the examples that you
12 provided in the middle.
13 Again, I'm reserving decision on that.
14 That's my inclination right now.
15 Let's go down to the very last disputed exception
16 here regarding the press exemption.
17 Mr. Bove, you request that the following be
18 added: This is called a press exemption, given that the
19 press function is a broad concept —— for example, the term
20 "legitimate press function" includes solicitation letters,
21 seeking news subscribers to the publication.
22 I don't have a major problem with that.
23 Why can't we just strike the phrase "legitimate
24 press function is a broad concept", and I can keep what
25 you have before that and what you have after that?

11   defraud could include defrauding a Government in the voting

17   is permitted to find that intent to defraud includes intent
18   to defraud the Government, it really leaves nothing for the
19   part of the concealment mens rea because the Government's
20   theory is that involved a conspiracy to defraud the
21   Government in the voting public.

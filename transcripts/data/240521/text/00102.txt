Charge Conference
4397
1 THE COURT: Page 2. That sounds right.
2 MR. BOVE: The first paragraph: "Evidence that
3 President Trump was present", that's a standard "mere
4 presence" charge.
5 I think, based on the conversations and reviewing
6 the Government's papers, what I would propose —— it's a
7 standard charge out of the CJI.
8 What I propose is, say, "Remove President Trump
9 from the equation," because we're mindful of the fact that
10 the Government doesn't have to establish this crime in its
11 entirety.
12 But, the concept of "mere presence" is important
13 because of the way the evidence came in about President
14 Trump being in certain places at certain times, and the
15 same with Pecker, Weisselberg, throughout.
16 We think this is an accurate statement in the law
17 about the conspiracy crime that is extraordinarily
18 important to the jury's deliberations if it gets to the
19 question of whether or not there's a felony.
20 THE COURT: Isn't that concern addressed in other
21 parts of the charge?
22 MR. BOVE: I'm not sure what you mean.
23 THE COURT: Such as the accomplice liability
24 section, that mere presence at the scene of a crime,
25 without more, by itself, does not constitute guilt?

1   accomplishing a single offense.
2            So, I think the key point here for this
3   instruction is to advise the jury that, yes, there has to
4   be some unlawful means, and to alert them as to what those
5   unlawful means are, but also advise them that they don't
6   have to unanimously agree on each of the unlawful means.
7            MR. BOVE:  That is the heart of the dispute in
8   these two competing proposals, is whether the jury should
9   be required to find unanimously which of the 17-152
10   unlawful means are at issue.
11            We understand the law that's been cited here.
12            We think your Honor has some discretion.
13            This is, obviously, an extraordinarily important
14   case.
15            We do have a motion pending from yesterday,
16   still.
17            Assuming this is going to go to the jury, in the
18   way that these statutes are being used in this case  --
19   which there's not much, if any, precedent for -- we submit
20   that the jury should be required to make very specific
21   findings, as specific as Your Honor's discretion would
22   permit, so it's very clear what happened at this trial.
23            THE COURT:  Do you agree, that's not ordinarily
24   required?
25            MR. BOVE:  Certainly.

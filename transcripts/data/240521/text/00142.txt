Charge Conference
4437
1            THE COURT:  Look, Mr. Bove, this is an issue that
2   has been going on for a very, very long time.
3            Going back to, I think it was December of 2023, I'm
4   not sure of the date, the People filed a motion asking this
5   Court to require the Defense to once and for all decide and
6   give notice whether the Defense was going to rely on the
7   defense of advice of counsel.
8            I wrote a decision on this.  My decision is dated
9   February 7th.
10            In that decision, I directed the Defense to provide
11   Notice of Disclosure of your intent to rely on the defense
12   of advice of counsel by March 11th, 2024, and to produce all
13   discoverable statements and communications within his
14   possession or control by the same date.
15            Subsequently, in response -- and the answer was
16   we're not relying on advice of counsel, therefore, there is
17   no waiver; there is no need to submit any documents.
18            Later on, the defense of advice of counsel morphed
19   into something called the presence of counsel, which I had
20   never heard of and I was not familiar with, but I addressed
21   it in the motions in limine.
22            And at that time, I indicated that you are
23   precluded from arguing this legal claim of presence of
24   counsel.
25            There was no such thing.  It's just a way to get

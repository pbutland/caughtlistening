Charge Conference

1   talk about next, to quote from other authorities that
2   provide the jury with some guidance about the types of
3   situations where this "irrespective" test is met and not
4   met.
5            THE COURT:  So, you're in agreement on the first
6   sentence regarding the "irrespective rule"?
7            The People submit that the sentence that they're
8   adding helps define what that means.
9            Your position is that in this context, it's
10   actually a bit confusing, but you propose additional
11   language that follows?
12            MR. BOVE:  We propose examples to give the jury a
13   sense as to how the FEC has applied it.
14            Our concern with the yellow highlighting that is
15   at issue right now is that this is not an authoritative
16   determination by the FEC. What it is is an advisory
17   opinion on a set of facts that included objective evidence
18   of the person's intent.
19            So, this -- the language that's proposed
20   extrapolates from that advisory opinion to invite the jury
21   to make some mixed motive determinations about subjective
22   considerations.
23            We don't think that's supported.
24            THE COURT:  You obtained the examples that you
25   proposed from where?

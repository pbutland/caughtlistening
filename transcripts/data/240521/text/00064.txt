Charge Conference
4359
1 point on summations —— regarding what the different
2 motivations were for executing the Karen McDougal payment
3 and the Stormy Daniels payment.
4 So, we thought this is an important point, that
5 there's some additional explanation for the jury regarding
6 what it means to pay someone's personal expenses and
7 whether he would have done it irrespective of the
8 candidacy or not.
9 THE COURT: What's your concern with that phrase?
10 MR. BOVE: The concern, Judge, is that the Harvey
11 advisory opinion that's being relied upon doesn't actually
12 involve an inquiry into the subjective intent of the
13 person making the payment, because in the Harvey advisory
14 opinion, that person wrote in and said: This is what I'm
15 going to do, this is my intention.
16 So, before the Commission on those circumstances,
17 there was objective, clear evidence of what the motivation
18 for the payment was.
19 So, this —— whatever the language is in this
20 opinion —— in the Harvey opinion, it doesn't support
21 inviting the jury to try to make an analysis of a mixed
22 motive behind these payments.
23 We think —— we are in agreement, as reflected
24 here, on the first sentence about the "irrespective rule".
25 Then we've endeavored in the ones we're going to

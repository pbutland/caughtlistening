Charge Conference

1   instruction from the bench, nor are you permitted to make
2   that argument.  Period.
3            MR. BOVE:  I understand.  I just want to complete
4   the record.
5            THE COURT:  Go ahead.
6            MR. BOVE:  I'm not being disingenuous with your
7   Honor.
8            I didn't -- this involvement of counsel wasn't
9   intended.
10            And I don't think it did change in any way the
11   substance of the argument that we want to make.
12            Our argument is based on testimony that happened
13   after the rulings that you just described at this trial,
14   when Michael Cohen testified that he told President Trump --
15            THE COURT:  You said that already, Mr. Bove.
16            MR. BOVE:  But then you called me "disingenuous,"
17   and I'm trying to explain myself.
18            THE COURT:  But I heard it the first time, and I
19   heard it the second time.
20            MR. BOVE:  In addition, nothing we are trying to
21   argue would require a waiver by President Trump.
22            He doesn't control Mr. Pecker's privilege.  That's
23   clear.
24            And the attorney -- the other attorney I'm talking
25   about, Michael Cohen, testified at the trial.

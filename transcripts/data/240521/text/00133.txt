1   inappropriate in front of the jury, unless somebody opens
2   the door to it.
3            I have been clear about our intentions with respect
4   to the door.
5            So there really shouldn't be any argument from the
6   Government in summations about what that non-pros reflects
7   on behalf of AMI, because that would be making arguments
8   about the non-pros as substantive evidence of President
9   Trump's guilt.
10            The only reason -- like the FECA pleas, the only
11   reason that the non-pros is in evidence is with respect to
12   Mr. Pecker's credibility.
13            It's not in evidence as substantive proof of
14   anything.
15            And so, to be arguing to the jury about whether
16   and to what extent it reflects a violation to be
17   inappropriate --
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  Judge, you gave a limiting
19   instruction.
20            The limiting instruction was not just limited to
21   Mr. Pecker's credibility; it was the surrounding
22   circumstances.
23            There are arguments that can be made.
24            And I agree that there are arguments that cannot be
25   made.

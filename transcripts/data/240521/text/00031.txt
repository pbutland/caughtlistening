R. Costello - Redirect/Bove
4326
1       Q    What did you mean when you expressed concern that "we
2   had been played here?"
3       A    He constantly referred to the fact -- Jeff Citron gave
4   him a Retainer Agreement, I think it was about two weeks after
5   the initial meeting on April 17th, 2018.
6       He stuck it in his briefcase that day and said to us, "I
7   will look at it later."
8       Every time Jeff asked him about the retainer, "Michael, did
9   you sign the retainer yet,"  he gave an excuse.
10       He would claim -- he tried to let us believe that he was
11   paying McDermott Will & Emery, which was conducting the
12   examination on all of the documents that had been seized
13   pursuant to the search warrants.
14       In fact, I found out from Giuliani that he wasn't even
15   paying --
16                MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
17       A    -- McDermott Will & Emery.
18                THE COURT:  Sustained.
19       Q    Were you concerned that you were representing Michael
20   Cohen, but he wasn't signing the Retainer Agreement?
21       A    Yeah, sure.
22                 MR. BOVE:  Now, I want to take a look at
23        Government Exhibit 2035 next, please.
24                 And if we could zoom in on the email.
25       Q    So this one is dated April 21st; do you see that?

Jury Charge
4848
1   enterprise, specifically, an invoice from Michael Cohen
2   dated February 14th, 2017, marked as a record of the Donald
3   J. Trump Revocable Trust, and kept and maintained by The
4   Trump Organization;
5            And, two, that the Defendant did so with intent to
6   defraud that included an intent to commit another crime or
7   to aid or conceal the commission thereof.
8            If you find the People have proven beyond a
9   reasonable doubt each of those two elements, you must find
10   the Defendant guilty of this crime.
11            If you find that the People have not proven beyond
12   a reasonable doubt either one or both of those elements, you
13   must find the Defendant not guilty of this crime.
14            You have now heard me define the law for count one.
15   There are 33 remaining counts in the indictment.  Each for
16   Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree and each
17   occurring in New York County.
18            The only difference is that each count pertains to
19   a different business record and possibly a different date.
20            The underlying law applies in the same way to each
21   of the remaining counts so I will only repeat it in full one
22   more time before I read count 34.
23            Of course, you can ask me to repeat the law in its
24   entirety as many times as you wish and I will be happy to do
25   so.

Jury Charge

1       accepted into evidence for a limited purpose only, and that
2       you were not to consider that evidence for any other
3       purpose.
4                 Under the law we refer to that as a limiting
5       instruction.  I will now remind you of some of the limiting
6       instructions you were given during that trial.
7                 You will recall that you heard testimony that
8       while David Pecker was an executive at AMI, AMI entered
9       into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Federal prosecutors,
10       as well as the Conciliation Agreement with the Federal
11       Election Commission, the FEC.  I remind you that evidence
12       was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David
13       Pecker's credibility and to help provide context for some
14       of the surrounding events.  You may consider that testimony
15       for those purposes only.
16                 Neither the Non-Prosecution Agreement, nor the
17       Conciliation Agreement is evidence of the Defendant's
18       guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether
19       the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged
20       crimes.
21                 You also heard testimony that the Federal
22       Election Commission conducted an investigation into the
23       payment to Stormy Daniels and of responses submitted by
24       Michael Cohen and his attorneys to the investigation.  That
25       evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in

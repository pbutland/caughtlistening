Proceedings
4890
1            MR. BLANCHE:  Your Honor, as we work through the
2   transcripts, can we excuse our client for this process so
3   he can go back?
4            We'll, obviously, waive his right to be present
5   for this part.
6            He's just sitting there, not doing anything.
7            MR. STEINGLASS:  Hmm. Give me one second.
8            Thinking.
9            (Whereupon, Mr. Steinglass pauses to think.)
10            MR. STEINGLASS:  We're not doing anything on the
11   record. We're just agreeing or not agreeing.
12            The only problem is, if we don't agree and we
13   have to get the judge involved.
14            MR. BLANCHE:  That's true.
15            MR. STEINGLASS:  Then he'll need to be here.
16            MR. BLANCHE:  I'm not saying can he leave the
17   courthouse.
18            I'm saying can he go back and not be inside this
19   room.
20            THE COURT:  You mean across the hall?
21            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
22            THE COURT:  You can do that on the record.
23            MS. HOFFINGER:  As it turns out, the laptop does
24   not have Wi-Fi capabilities, so we're good.
25            MR. STEINGLASS:  Is that on the record?

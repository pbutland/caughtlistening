Jury Charge
4817
1                 THE COURT:  Anything that we need to go over
2       before we bring at jury out?
3                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Very briefly.
4                 As we were comparing a verdict sheet to the
5       charge, we noticed a minor omission.
6                 On Page 40, for the 34th Count to be consistent
7       with the other counts, we believe it should say after the
8       date, bearing check number 003006.
9                 THE COURT:  That was for the 34th Count, right?
10                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes, Judge.
11                 Thank you.
12                 THE COURT:  Anything else?
13                 All right.
14                 Let's get the jury, please.
15                 SERGEANT:  All rise.
16                 Jury entering.
17                      (Whereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom
18                 and were properly seated.)
19                 THE COURT:  You may be seated.
20                 THE CLERK:  Do all parties stipulate that all
21       jurors are present and properly seated?
22                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
24                 THE CLERK:  Thank you.
25                 THE COURT:  Good morning, Jurors.

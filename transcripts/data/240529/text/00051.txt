Jury Charge
4866
1 What we ask the foreperson to do during
2 deliberations is we ask you to sign any written note that
3 the jury sends to the Court.
4 The foreperson does not have to write the note or
5 even agree with its contents.
6 The foreperson's signature indicates only that the
7 writing does, in fact, come from the jury.
8 The foreperson may also chair the jury's
9 discussions during deliberations.
10 When the jury has reached a verdict, guilty or not
11 guilty, the entire jury will be asked to come into court.
12 The foreperson will be asked whether the jury has
13 reached a verdict.
14 And if the foreperson says, yes, the foreperson
15 will then be asked what the verdict is for each of the
16 charged counts.
17 After that, the entire jury will be asked whether
18 that is their verdict and will answer yes or no.
19 Finally, upon the request of the party, each juror
20 will be asked individually, whether the announced verdict is
21 the verdict of that juror, and upon being asked, each juror
22 will answer yes or no.
23 I will give you a form known as a verdict sheet.
24 The verdict sheet lists each count submitted for your
25 consideration and the possible verdicts.

1            The question is directly about what happened at
2   the August meeting, and then a question about what wasn't
3   said.
4            So, what was said, what wasn't said, we would
5   argue that's responsive.
6            THE COURT:  Let me read the area before that and
7   the area after that, the surrounding testimony, and I'll
8   have a better sense of it.
9            MR. STEINGLASS:  May I say one thing about that,
10   Judge?
11            THE COURT:  Of course.
12            MR. STEINGLASS:  This meeting happened in 2015.
13   There was no Stormy Daniels to discuss in 2015.
14            If we're discussing how the meeting was put into
15   effect with all the three subsequent individuals, none of
16   them were discussed by name at that meeting because they
17   didn't exist yet in terms of the catch-and-kill plan.
18            So, this is why we feel this is about execution,
19   subsequently, over the subsequent months and should fall
20   into the category of execution, rather than content at the
21   meeting.
22            THE COURT:  What do you think about that?
23            MR. BLANCHE:  I still think the same point
24   applies.
25            It's not -- the question is about the evidence

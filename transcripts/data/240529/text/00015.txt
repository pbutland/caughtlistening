Jury Charge
4830
1 Defendant is guilty of a charged crime, you must find the
2 Defendant guilty of that crime.
3 As judges of the facts, you alone determine the
4 truthfulness and accuracy of the testimony of each witness.
5 You must decide whether a witness has told the
6 truth and was accurate, or instead, testified falsely or
7 was mistaken.
8 You must also decide what importance to give to
9 the testimony you accept as truthful and accurate. It is
10 the quality of the testimony that is controlling, not the
11 number of witnesses who testified.
12 If you find that any witness has intentionally
13 testified falsely as to any material fact, you may
14 disregard that witness’s entire testimony. Or, you may
15 disregard so much of it as you find was untruthful, and
16 accept so much of it as you find to have been truthful and
17 accurate.
18 There is no particular formula for evaluating the
19 truthfulness and accuracy of another person’s statements or
20 testimony. You bring to this process all of your varied
21 experiences. In life, you frequently decide the
22 truthfulness and accuracy of statements made to you by
23 other people. The same factors used to make those
24 decisions, should be used in this case when evaluating
25 testimony.

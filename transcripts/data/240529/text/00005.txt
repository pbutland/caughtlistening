1       unconscious views may come from stereotypes and attitudes
2       about people or groups of people that may impact on a
3       person's thinking and decision-making without that person
4       even knowing it.
5                 As a juror, you are asked to make a very
6       important decision about another member of the community.
7                 I know you would not want to make that decision
8       based on such stereotypes or attitudes, that is, on what we
9       call implicit biases and it would be wrong for you to do
10       so.
11                 A fair juror must guard against the impact of
12       such stereotypes or attitudes.  You can do this by asking
13       yourselves during your deliberations whether your views and
14       conclusions would be different if the Defendant, witnesses
15       or others that you have heard about or seen in court were
16       of a different race, color, national origin, ancestry,
17       gender, gender identity or expression, religious practice,
18       age or sexual orientation, or if they did not have a
19       disability.
20                 If the answer is yes, then, in keeping with your
21       promise to be fair, reconsider your views and conclusions
22       along with the other jurors, and make sure your verdict is
23       based on evidence and not on stereotypes or attitudes.
24       Justice requires no less.
25                 Jurors, you will recall that during jury

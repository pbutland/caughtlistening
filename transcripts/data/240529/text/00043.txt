Jury Charge
4858
1 Defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of
2 any person to a public office by unlawful means, you need
3 not be unanimous as to what those unlawful means were.
4 In determining whether the Defendant conspired to
5 promote or prevent the election of any person to a public
6 office by unlawful means, you may consider the following
7 unlawful means:
8 Violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act,
9 otherwise known as FECA; the falsification of other business
10 records; or violations of Tax Laws.
11 The first of the People's theories of "unlawful
12 means," which I will now define for you is the Federal
13 Election Campaign Act.
14 Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, it is
15 unlawful for an individual to willfully make a contribution
16 to any candidate with respect to any election for Federal
17 office, including the office of President of the United
18 States, which exceeds a certain limit.
19 In 2015 and 2016, that limit was $2,700.
20 It is also unlawful under the Federal Election
21 Campaign Act for any corporation to willfully make a
22 contribution of any amount to a candidate or candidate's
23 campaign in connection with any Federal election, or for any
24 person to cause such a corporate contribution.
25 For purposes of these prohibitions, and expenditure

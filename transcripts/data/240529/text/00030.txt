Jury Charge
4845
1 Campaign Act for any corporation to willfully make a
2 contribution of any amount to a candidate or candidate's
3 campaign in connection with any Federal election, or for any
4 person to cause such a corporate contribution.
5 For purposes of these prohibitions, and expenditure
6 made in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the
7 request or suggestion of, a candidate or his agents shall be
8 considered to be a contribution to such candidate.
9 The terms "contribution" and "expenditure" include
10 anything of value, including any purchase, payment, loan, or
11 advance, made by any person for the purpose of influencing
12 any election to Federal office.
13 Under Federal law, a third party's payment of a
14 candidate's expenses is deemed to be a contribution to the
15 candidate, unless, the payment would have been made
16 irrespective of the candidacy.
17 If the payment would have been made even in the
18 absence of the candidacy, the payment should not be treated
19 as a contribution.
20 FECA's definitions of "contribution" and
21 "expenditure" do not include any cost incurred in covering
22 or carrying a news story, commentary, or editorial by a
23 magazine, periodical publication, or similar press entity so
24 long as such activity is a normal, legitimate press
25 function.

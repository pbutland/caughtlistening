Jury Charge
4839
1 guilty or not guilty, must be unanimous. In order to find
2 the Defendant guilty, however, you need not be unanimous on
3 whether the Defendant committed the crime personally, or by
4 acting in concert with another, or both.
5 The First Count is falsifying business records in
6 the first degree:
7 Under our law, a person is guilty of falsifying
8 business records in the first degree when, with intent to
9 defraud that includes an intent to commit another crime or
10 to aid or conceal the commission thereof, that person:
11 Makes or causes a false entry in the business
12 records of an enterprise.
13 The following terms used in that definition have
14 a special meaning under our law:
15 Enterprise means any entity of one or more
16 persons, corporate or otherwise, public or private, engaged
17 in business, commercial, professional, industrial, social,
18 political or governmental activity.
19 Business record means any writing or article,
20 including computer data or a computer program, kept or
21 maintained by an enterprise for the purpose of evidencing
22 or reflecting its condition or activity.
23 Intent means conscious objective or purpose.
24 Thus, a person acts with intent to defraud when
25 his or her conscious objective or purpose is to do so.

Jury Charge
4868
1 hold for you while you are engaged in deliberations.
2 You must deliberate about the case only when you
3 are all gathered together in the jury room.
4 You must not, for example, discuss the case as you
5 go to and from the courtroom.
6 It is important that each juror have the
7 opportunity to hear whatever another juror has to say about
8 the case, and that by law must only be done when you are all
9 gathered together in the jury room.
10 Thus, if for any reason, all 12 of you are not
11 gathered together in the jury room, please stop deliberating
12 until you are all present.
13 During your deliberations, you must discuss the
14 case only among yourselves; you must not discuss the case
15 with anyone else, including a court officer, and you must
16 not permit anyone other than a fellow juror to discuss the
17 case in your presence.
18 If you have a question or request, you must
19 communicate with me by writing a note, which you will give
20 to me —— which you will give to a court officer to give to
21 me.
22 The law requires that you communicate with me in
23 writing, in part, to make sure that there are no
24 misunderstandings.
25 At this time, the plan is to work today until 4:30.

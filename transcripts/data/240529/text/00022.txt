Jury Charge
4837
1 nonetheless so harmonizes with the narrative of the
2 accomplice as to satisfy you that the accomplice is telling
3 the truth about the Defendant's participation in the crime
4 and thereby tends to connect the Defendant to the
5 commission of the crime.
6 I will now instruct you on the law applicable to
7 the charged offenses. That offense is falsifying business
8 records in the first degree, 34 counts.
9 Our law recognizes that two or more individuals
10 can act jointly to commit a crime, and that in certain
11 circumstances, each can be held criminally liable for the
12 acts of the others. In that situation, those persons can
13 be said to be, acting in concert with each other.
14 Our law defines the circumstance under which one
15 person may be criminally liable for the conduct of another.
16 That definition is as follows:
17 When one person engages in conduct which
18 constitutes an offense, another is criminally liable for
19 such conduct when, acting with the state of mind required
20 for the commission of that offense, he or she solicits,
21 requests, commands, importunes, or intentionally aids such
22 person to engage in such conduct.
23 Under that definition, mere presence at the scene
24 of a crime, even with knowledge that the crime was taking
25 place, or mere association with a perpetrator of a crime,

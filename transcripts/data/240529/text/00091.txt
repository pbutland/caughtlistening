1            So, that question and that answer are
2   specifically referring to something that was not a part of
3   the Trump Tower meeting, so why would that be included?
4            MR. STEINGLASS:  We don't think it should be.
5            MR. BLANCHE:  Well, your Honor, the question asks
6   for any testimony referring -- about the Trump Tower
7   meeting. So, that's testimony about the meeting, even if
8   it includes something that didn't happen at the meeting.
9   It's not execution.
10            THE COURT:  A lot of things didn't happen at that
11   meeting. A lot of things. We can start looking through the
12   transcript and find all the things that didn't happen at
13   that meeting.
14            According to your logic, that would be responsive
15   to the question.
16            Go ahead.
17            MR. BLANCHE:  No. I don't think so.
18            If there's a question about the meeting, about
19   what was said.
20            But, there's a question about what was not said
21   at the meeting as it relates to the evidence in the case.
22            That's still responsive to the question.
23            I understand what the Court is saying. That would
24   mean anything could come in.
25            But, that's not true.

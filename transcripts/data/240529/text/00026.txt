Jury Charge
4841
1 for the commission of this crime.
2 As I previously explained, a person acts with
3 intent to defraud when his or her conscious objective or
4 purpose is to do so.
5 In order to prove an intent to defraud, the
6 People need not prove that the Defendant acted with the
7 intent to defraud any particular person or entity. A
8 general intent to defraud any person or entity suffices.
9 Intent to defraud is also not constricted to an
10 intent to deprive another of property or money and can
11 extend beyond economic concerns.
12 For the crime of falsifying business records in
13 the first degree, the intent to defraud must include an
14 intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the
15 commission thereof.
16 Under our law, although the People must prove an
17 intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the
18 commission thereof, they need not prove that the other
19 crime was, in fact, committed, aided, or concealed.
20 The People allege that the other crime the
21 Defendant intended to commit, aid, or conceal is a
22 violation of New York Election Law Section 17—152.
23 Section 17—152 of the New York Election Law
24 provides that any two or more than persons who conspire to
25 promote or prevent the election of any person to a public

7            THE COURT:  Are there any objections or exceptions?
8            MR. STEINGLASS:  Just one thing.  Just one minor
9   thing.
10            THE COURT:  Are there any exceptions to the charge?
11            MR. STEINGLASS:  No.
12            MR. BOVE:  No, Judge.
13            Other than to preserve the ones that we made, to
14   the extent that it differs from our requests and what we
15   raised in the charge conference.
16            MR. STEINGLASS:  One thing is that, Judge, I'm
17   sorry I didn't notice this earlier, that we asked that when
18   the foreperson signs the notes, can we make it clear that he
19   does that with his juror number and not his actual name?
20            THE COURT:  I think I made clear that Juror Number
21   1 is the foreperson.
22            MR. STEINGLASS:  No, I know.
23            THE COURT:  You mean to sign it with his juror
24   number instead of his name?
25            MR. STEINGLASS:  To sign it with his juror number,

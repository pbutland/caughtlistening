1            MS. HOFFINGER:  Hopefully, we should be able to
2   turn it off.
3            THE COURT:  Tonight, after we excuse the jurors,
4   let's get our hands on the WiFi and turn it off.
5            I think they're gathering the jurors right now.
6            We can bring them in when they're ready.
7            How many pages are we looking at, total, as far
8   as that read-back?

10            It looks like maybe 30?
11            MR. BLANCHE:  That's about right.
12            THE COURT:  Thirty pages.
13            Is it fair to say that's like a 30-minute

20   jurors are seated in the jury box at 3:59 PM.)
21            THE CLERK:  Do the parties stipulate that all
22   jurors are present and properly seated?

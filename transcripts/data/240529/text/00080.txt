2            So jump in, Mr. Blanche, if I'm not getting this
3   one.
4            The first one, we agree, starts on Page 1017,
5   Line 13.
6            But, we disagree about where it ends.
7            The People believe it ends --
8            THE COURT REPORTER:  Can you give the Judge a
9   copy?
10            THE COURT:  Starts on Page 1017, Line 13.
11            MR. STEINGLASS:  We both agree about that.
12            THE COURT:  You disagree?
13            MR. STEINGLASS:  We disagree about where it ends.
14            The Defense believes it ends on Page 1025, Line
15   4. And we believe it ends on Page 1026, Line 20.
16            (Whereupon, the Court is given the transcript.)
17            THE COURT:  Are there any other disputed areas?
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
19            Would you like me to go through the disputed
20   areas or go in order?
21            THE COURT:  Let's deal with this one first, the
22   one that you just brought up.
23            Tell me what the issue is there.
24            MR. STEINGLASS:  Is it okay if we sit for this
25   conversation?

Jury Charge
4840
1                 Intent does not require premeditation.  In other
2       words, intent does not require advance planning.  Nor is it
3       necessary that the intent be in a person's mind for any
4       particular period of time.
5                 The intent can be formed, and need only exist, at
6       the very moment the person engages in prohibited conduct or
7       acts to cause the prohibited result, and not at any earlier
8       time.
9                 The question naturally arises as to how to
10       determine whether a defendant had the intent required for
11       the commission of a crime.
12                 To make that determination in this case, you must
13       decide if the required intent can be inferred beyond a
14       reasonable doubt from the proven facts.
15                 In doing so, you may consider the person's
16       conduct and all of the circumstances surrounding that
17       conduct, including, but not limited to, to the following:
18                 What, if anything, did the person do or say?
19                 What result, if any, followed the person's
20       conduct?
21                 And was that result the natural, necessary and
22       probable consequence of that conduct.
23                 Therefore, in this case, from the facts you find
24       to have been proven, decide whether you can infer beyond a
25       reasonable doubt that the Defendant had the intent required

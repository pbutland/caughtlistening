5 offense, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt:
6 First, that he solicited, requested, commanded
7 importuned, or intentionally aided that person to engage in
8 that conduct.
9 And second, that he did so with the state of mind
10 required for the commission of the offense.
11 If it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
12 the Defendant is criminally liable for the conduct of
13 another, the extent or degree of the defendant’s
14 participation in the crime does to the matter.
15 A defendant proven beyond a reasonable doubt to
16 be criminally liable for the conduct of another in the
17 commission of crime is as guilty of the crime as if the
18 Defendant, personally, had committed every act constituting
19 that crime.
20 The People have the burden of proving beyond a
21 reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted in the state of
22 mind required for the commission of the crime, and either
23 personally, or by acting in concert with another person,
24 committed each of the remaining elements of the crime.

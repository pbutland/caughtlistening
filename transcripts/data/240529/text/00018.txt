Jury Charge
4833
1       witness who has been convicted of a crime or who has
2       engaged in criminal conduct, or to accept the testimony of
3       a witness who has not.
4                 You may, however, consider whether a witness's
5       criminal conviction or conduct has affected the
6       truthfulness of the witness's testimony.
7                 You may consider whether a witness made
8       statements at this trial that are inconsistent with each
9       other.
10                 You may also consider whether a witness made
11       previous statements that are inconsistent with his or her
12       testimony at trial.
13                 You may consider whether a witness testified to a
14       fact here at trial that the witness omitted to state at a
15       prior time, when it would have been reasonable and logical
16       for the witness to have stated that fact.  In determining
17       whether it would have been reasonable and logical for the
18       witness to have stated the omitted fact, you may consider
19       whether the witness's attention was called to the matter,
20       and whether the witness was specifically asked about it.
21                 If a witness has made such inconsistent
22       statements or omissions, you may consider whether and to
23       what extent they affect the truthfulness or accuracy of
24       that witness's testimony here at this trial.

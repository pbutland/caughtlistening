Proceedings

1            I think that the question on Page 1026, beginning
2   with Line 1, is a little different. It's not just the
3   execution. I think it summarizes what the plan was. The
4   plan was to help the campaign.
5            So, I agree with you that the section ending at
6   1025, Line 4, which you're in agreement with, it can end
7   there.
8            But then, I think that we can jump ahead and pick
9   it back up on Page 1026, Lines 1 through 7.
10            MR. BLANCHE:  Okay.
11            So 1026, Lines --
12            THE COURT:  1 through 7.
13            So, the vast majority of what you're taking
14   exception to, I'm agreeing with you, except for those
15   seven lines.
16            MR. BLANCHE:  Understood.
17            That addresses our concern.
18            THE COURT:  Okay. Good.
19            What's the next one?
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  Okay.
21            MR. STEINGLASS:  The next one is Page 1029, Line
22   9 through 13.
23            Keep going?
24            THE COURT:  Sure.
25            MR. STEINGLASS:  Page 1065, Line 16 through 24.

Jury Charge
4818
1                 Members of the Jury, I will now instruct you on
2       the law.  I will first review the general principles of law
3       that apply to this case and all criminal cases.
4                 You have heard me explain some of those
5       principles at the beginning of the trial.  I am sure you
6       can appreciate the benefits of repeating those instructions
7       at this stage of the proceedings.
8                 Next, I will define the crimes charged in this
9       case, explain the law that applies to those definitions and
10       spell out the elements of the charged crimes.
11                 Finally, I will outline the process of jury
12       deliberations.
13                 These instructions will take about an hour, and
14       you will not receive copies of them.  You may however,
15       request that I read them back to you in whole or in part as
16       many times as you wish, and I will be happy to do so.
17                 During these instructions, I will not summarize
18       the evidence.  If it is necessary, I may refer to portions
19       of the evidence to explain the law that relates to it.  My
20       reference to evidence, or my decision not to refer to
21       evidence, expresses no opinion about the truthfulness,
22       accuracy or importance of any particular evidence.
23                 In fact, nothing I have said in the course of
24       this trial was meant to suggest that I have an opinion
25       about this case.  If you have formed an impression that I

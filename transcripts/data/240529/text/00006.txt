Jury Charge
4821
1 selection you agreed that you would set aside any personal
2 opinions or bias you might have in favor of or against the
3 Defendant, and that you would decide this case fairly on
4 the evidence and on the law.
5 Again, I direct you to decide this case on the
6 evidence and the law as it relates to the Defendant here on
7 trial.
8 You must set aside any personal opinions or bias
9 you might have in favor of or against the Defendant, and
10 you must not allow any such opinions to influence your
11 verdict.
12 Remember, also, in your deliberations, you may
13 not consider or speculate about matters relating to
14 sentence or punishment. If there is a verdict of guilty,
15 it will be my responsibility to impose an appropriate
16 sentence.
17 When you judge the facts, you are to consider
18 only the evidence.
19 The evidence in this case includes:
20 The testimony of the witnesses, the exhibits that
21 were received in evidence, and the stipulations agreed to
22 by the parties.
23 Remember, a stipulation is information the
24 parties have agreed to present to the jury as evidence,
25 without calling a witness to testify.

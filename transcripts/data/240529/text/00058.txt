Jury Charge
4873
1   evidence?
2            MS. HOFFINGER:  We have a laptop prepared with the
3   Prosecution's exhibits as well as the Defense exhibits and
4   the two Court exhibits.
5            It doesn't have a password on it.
6            We can certainly show -- have one of our paralegals
7   show the jury how to access it.
8            But it doesn't have a password.  It's very easy to
9   access.
10            MR. STEINGLASS:  If you guys want to examine it
11   first.
12            MR. BOVE:  We trust that you put it together
13   accurately and completely.
14            I think, though, that we would ask that somebody
15   that's not a member of the Government show the jurors how to
16   use the laptop, assuming there's nothing complicated, no
17   fancy features.
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  Who would you like?
19            MR. BOVE:  A member of the Court staff.
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  Oh, I see.
21            MS. HOFFINGER:  Otherwise --
22            THE COURT:  I'm not able to involve them.  It's not
23   our evidence.  It's not our laptop.
24            MS. HOFFINGER:  What we could do, and it has been
25   done before, if would you like, one member of the Defense

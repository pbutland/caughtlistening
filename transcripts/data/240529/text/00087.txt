Proceedings
4902
1            MR. STEINGLASS:  I'm not sure that we are in
2   agreement about that.
3            What we're saying is none of it should come in,
4   and if the first part is going to come in, the second part
5   should come in because it contextualizes what happens in
6   the second part.
7            THE COURT:  Where is the second part?
8            The first one is Page 1316, Line 7, through 1319,
9   Line 6.
10            What is the second part?
11            MR. STEINGLASS:  The second part is the apology
12   on 1339, Line 19, through 1340, Line 11.
13            But, I would -- in order to give context to that
14   apology, I would ask your Honor to review the colloquy.
15            Even if we don't decide this while we're sitting
16   here and need to think about it, I think the colloquy
17   explains exactly why we think this is misleading and
18   should not come in.
19            THE COURT:  Okay.
20            For the sake of time, I'll take this with me and
21   consider it.
22            MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
23            THE COURT:  What else?
24            MR. STEINGLASS:  Next. 1345, Lines 5 through 13.
25            THE COURT:  I'm sorry.

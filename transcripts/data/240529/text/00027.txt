Jury Charge
4842
1 office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon
2 by one or more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of
3 conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.
4 Under our law, a person is guilty of such a
5 conspiracy when, with intent that conduct be performed that
6 would promote or prevent the election of a person to public
7 office by unlawful means, he or she agrees with one or more
8 persons to engage in or cause the performance of such
9 conduct.
10 Knowledge of a conspiracy does not by itself make
11 the Defendant a co—conspirator. The Defendant must intend
12 that conduct be performed that would promote or prevent the
13 election of a person to public office by unlawful means.
14 Intent mean conscious objective or purpose.
15 Thus, a person acts with the intent that conduct
16 be performed that would promote or prevent the election of
17 a person to public office by unlawful means when his or her
18 conscious objective or purpose is that such conduct be
19 performed.
20 Evidence that Defendant was present when others
21 agreed to engage in the performance of a crime does not by
22 itself show that he personally agreed to engage in the
23 conspiracy.

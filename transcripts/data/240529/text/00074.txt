1            Once you get to the jury room -- sometimes all 12
2   of you are present -- you can continue your deliberations.
3            We'll be working out here. I promise you, we'll
4   be working on trying to find the read-back.
5            When we're ready for you, we'll invite you back
6   out.
7            You can decide tomorrow morning if you would like
8   to work late, if necessary. We will not work beyond six
9   o'clock. It's entirely up to you.
10            You don't have to work late.
11            Just let me know at some point tomorrow.
12            I believe that's it for now.
13            See you tomorrow morning at 9:30.
14            Thank you.
15            Good night.
16            (Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors
17   are excused for the day at 4:06 PM.)
18            THE COURT:  Regarding the first note, I ask
19   Counsel to please not leave the courtroom until we've
20   identified and we've settled on what that read-back is,
21   we're all on the same page. Let me know.
22            And at that point, we can call it in.
23            MR. STEINGLASS:  Okay.
24            MR. BLANCHE:  Can we approach?
25            THE COURT:  Sure.

Proceedings
4894
1 THE COURT: Let's move on to the second one.
2 MR. STEINGLASS: I think we agree on that one,
3 too, Judge.
4 That's Page 1158, Line 19, to Page 1160, Line 16.
5 And Page 1463, Line 8, to 1464, Line 15.
6 MR. BLANCHE: Agreed.
7 THE COURT: Third request.
8 MR. STEINGLASS: This is the tough one.
9 THE COURT: Let's skip the third one for now, and
10 let's go to the fourth.
11 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay.
12 The fourth one is Page 3293, Line 23, to Page
13 3295, Line 1. And Page 3925, Line 9 through Line 16.
14 MR. BLANCHE: Agreed.
15 THE COURT: So, the one that is in dispute is the
16 third request.
17 MR. STEINGLASS: Right.
18 THE COURT: David Pecker's testimony regarding
19 the Trump Tower meeting.
20 MR. STEINGLASS: Right.
21 And there's about 10 or 12 different parts of the
22 transcript that are responsive, and I think we agree on
23 nine of 10 of them.
24 I'll try to go in order here.
25 This one is confusing, and there's a lot of notes

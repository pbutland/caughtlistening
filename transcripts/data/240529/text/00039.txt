Jury Charge
4854
1   in the First Degree, but as it pertains to a check and
2   check stub dated September 5th, 2017, bearing check number
3   003006.
4            I will now repeat for you the law pertaining to the
5   crime of Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree in
6   its entirety.
7            Under our law, a person is guilty of Falsifying
8   Business Records in the First Degree when, with intent to
9   defraud that includes an intent to commit another crime or
10   to aid or conceal the commission thereof, that person makes
11   or causes a false entry in the business records of an
12   enterprise.
13            The following terms used in that definition have a
14   special meaning:
15            "Enterprise."  "Enterprise" means any entity of one
16   or more persons, corporate or otherwise, public or private,
17   engaged in business, commercial, professional, industrial,
18   social, political or governmental activity.
19            "Business record" means any writing or article,
20   including computer data or a computer program, kept or
21   maintained by an enterprise for the purpose of evidencing or
22   reflecting its condition or activity.
23            "Intent" means conscious objective or purpose.
24   Thus, a person acts with intent to defraud when his or her
25   conscious objective or purpose is to do so.

1            THE COURT:  Thank you.
2            The court reporter will hand you her Index so you
3   could work off that.
4            (Whereupon, a recess is taken while the parties

7            THE SERGEANT:  Remain seated.
8            Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.
9            THE COURT:  I know you've both been working on
10   the jury note and you're getting closer.
11            But, we did just receive another note.
12            I believe you both received copies of that second
13   note.
14            MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
15            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
16            THE COURT:  This is marked as Court Exhibit
17   Number 5.  It has been marked by the jury foreperson. It
18   was marked at 3:51.

20   judge's instructions."
21            In light of that note, my suggestion is that we
22   bring the jury out here, back into the courtroom; we tell
23   them that we're working on finding the read-back that they
24   requested; and I clarify when they say they want the
25   instructions, whether they want the entire instructions or

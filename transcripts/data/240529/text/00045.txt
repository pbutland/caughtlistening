Jury Charge

1 business records.
2 Under New York Law, a person is guilty of
3 Falsifying Business Records in the Second Degree when with
4 intent to the defraud, he or she makes or causes a false
5 entry in a business records of an enterprise.
6 I previously defined for you the terms enterprise,
7 business records and intent to defraud.
8 For purposes of determining whether Falsifying
9 Business Records in the Second Degree was an "unlawful
10 means," used by conspiracy to promote or prevent an
11 election, you may consider:
12 The bank records associated with Michael Cohen's
13 account formation paperwork for the Resolution Consultants
14 LLC and Essential Consultants LLC accounts;
15 The bank records associated with Michael Cohen's
16 wire to Keith Davidson;
17 The invoice from Investor Advisory Services, Inc.,
18 to Resolution Consultants;
19 And the 1099â€”Miscellaneous forms that The Trump
20 Organization issued to Michael Cohen.
21 The People's third theory of "unlawful means,"
22 which I will define for you, is a violation of Tax Laws.
23 Under New York State and New York City Law, it is
24 unlawful to knowingly supply or submit materially false or
25 fraudulent information in connection with any tax return.

Jury Charge
4863
1 the lack of a motive, may be considered by the jury.
2 For example, if you find from the evidence that the
3 Defendant had a motive to commit the crime charged, that is
4 a circumstance you may wish to consider as tending to
5 support a finding of guilt.
6 On the other hand, if the proof establishes that
7 the Defendant had no motive to commit the crime charged,
8 that is a circumstance you may wish to consider as tending
9 to establish that the Defendant is not guilty of a charged
10 crime.
11 Your verdict, on each count you consider, whether
12 guilty or not guilty, must be unanimous, that is, each and
13 every juror must agree to it.
14 To reach a unanimous verdict, you must deliberate
15 with the other jurors.
16 That means, you should discuss the evidence and
17 consult with each other, listen to each other, give each
18 other's views careful consideration, and reason together
19 when considering the evidence.
20 And when you deliberate, you should do so with a
21 view towards reaching an agreement, if that can be done
22 without surrendering individual judgment.
23 Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but
24 only after a fair and impartial consideration of the
25 evidence with the other jurors.

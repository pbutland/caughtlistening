1 "Three. Pecker's testimony regarding Trump Tower
2 meeting.
3 "And, four. Michael Cohen's testimony regarding
4 the Trump Tower meeting."
5 Did I read that correctly?
6 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.
7 MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.
8 THE COURT: I'm told that we have two sets of
9 pagination for the transcript. One set is the set that we
10 received on a daily basis. The combined set is slightly
11 different in terms of pagination. I think we should all
12 work off the combined set.
13 I am told that the court reporter has a Page
14 Index that's about 700 pages. That can make it easier for
15 you to find it.
16 I will be in the robing room when you're ready.
17 Let me know when you're ready for readâ€”back.
18 One more question. When we bring the jurors in,
19 ordinarily, I like to sit the alternate jurors in the
20 front row. Obviously, that's not possible here.
21 Is there any objection to having the alternate
22 jurors sitting in the box with the 12 jurors, as they've
23 been sitting all along?
24 MR. STETNGLASS: No objection.
25 MR. BLANCHE: We don't have an objection to that.

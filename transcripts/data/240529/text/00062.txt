Jury Charge
4877
1            Should we bring them out here or, yes, let's bring
2   juror number four and juror number six out to be shown how
3   to work the laptop.
4            And just to be clear, for the record, all of the
5   evidence is there and the jurors can have access to that
6   laptop, and all of the evidence and they can just look
7   through those files; right?
8            MS. HOFFINGER:  Yes.
9            THE COURT:  All right.
10            (Pause in the proceedings.)
11            THE COURT:  All right.  We are bringing in juror
12   number four and juror number six.
13            THE SERGEANT:  Do you want them seated, Judge?
14            THE COURT:  No.  They can come right over to the
15   table.
16            (Pause in the proceedings.)
17            THE COURT:  So, while we wait for jurors number
18   four and number six, I just want to go on the record and --
19   oh, they are coming into the courtroom now.
20            They can just come in.
21            That's fine.
22            THE LIEUTENANT:  Jurors entering.
23            (Two jurors enter the courtroom at this time.)
24            (Explanation of the laptop operation was done off
25   the record, in the presence of all counsel, at this time.)

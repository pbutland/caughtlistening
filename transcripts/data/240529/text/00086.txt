1   crossed about.
2            The first meeting in July of 2018 is what we
3   believe should be included, which is 1316, Line 7, through
4   1319, Line 6.
5            What happened thereafter -- and there was some
6   objections, but the questions were allowed, and they were
7   answered by the witness.
8            Thereafter, there was another meeting discussed.
9   There was an objection, a sidebar as it relates to that
10   meeting; and it resulted in the next day Mr. Bove -- I
11   wouldn't say "apologizing" -- but cleaning it up, moving
12   on.
13            We agree with the People that that doesn't need
14   to be included. It was too confusing.
15            What we're offering is directly responsive, in
16   our view, which is questions about a different meeting
17   that were -- that came into evidence but that were
18   responsive to the question.
19            That's the disagreement.
20            We don't want the colloquy or the long confusion,
21   either.
22            THE COURT:  So, we're in agreement that that
23   second part should not come in.
24            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes. Yes.
25            THE COURT:  Let's deal with the first part.

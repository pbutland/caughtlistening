Jury Charge
4855
1 Intent does not require premeditation. In other
2 words, intent does not require advance planning. Nor is it
3 necessary that the intent be in a person's mind for any
4 particular period of time.
5 The intent can be formed, and need only exist, at
6 the very moment the person engages in prohibited conduct or
7 acts to cause the prohibited result, and not at any earlier
8 time.
9 The question naturally arises as to how to
10 determine whether a defendant had the intent required for
11 the commission of a crime.
12 To make that determination in this case, you must
13 decide whether if the required intent can be inferred beyond
14 a reasonable doubt from the proven facts.
15 In doing so, you may consider the person's conduct
16 and all of the circumstances surrounding that conduct,
17 including, but not limited to, the following:
18 What, if anything, did the person do or say; what
19 result, if any, followed the person's conduct; and was that
20 result the natural and necessary and probable consequence of
21 that conduct?
22 Therefore, in this case, from the facts you find to
23 have been proven, decide whether you can infer beyond a
24 reasonable doubt that the Defendant had the intent required
25 for the commission of this crime.

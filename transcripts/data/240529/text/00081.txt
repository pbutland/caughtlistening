1 THE COURT: Of course.
2 MR. STEINGLASS: So, the issue is: This is a
3 question about what happened at the Trump Tower meeting,
4 David Pecker's testimony.
5 The disputed portion is when David Pecker relays
6 what happened to that —— in that meeting to Dylan Howard,
7 which we believe is responsive to the request insofar as
8 he's communicating the substance of that meeting to
9 another person.
10 MR. BLANCHE: Um, your Honor, we disagree.
11 We think that if you start with Line 5, that
12 says: "Did you discuss this meeting with anyone
13 afterwards?", that's not in response to the question.
14 Just so your Honor is aware, both sides agree
15 that we would narrow the responsive portions of the
16 transcripts to the meeting itself and not what happened
17 afterwards; the execution of the meeting and what they did
18 because of the meeting.
19 So, the question begins: "Did you discuss this
20 meeting with anyone afterwards?"
21 We believe that gets into an area that is
22 indirectly responsive.
23 THE COURT: All right.
24 MR. STEINGLASS: Mr. Blanche is right.
25 We could agree that we've tried to draw a line

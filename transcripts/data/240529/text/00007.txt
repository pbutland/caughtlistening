Jury Charge
4822
1 Testimony which was stricken from the record or
2 to which an objection was sustained must be disregarded by
3 you.
4 Exhibits that were received in evidence, are
5 available, upon your request, for your inspection and
6 consideration.
7 Exhibits that were just seen during the trial, or
8 marked for identification but not received in evidence, are
9 not evidence, and are thus not available for your
10 inspection and consideration.
11 Testimony based upon those exhibits that were not
12 received in evidence may be considered by you. It is just
13 the exhibit itself is not available for your inspection and
14 that may not be considered.
15 In evaluating the evidence, you may consider any
16 fact that is proven and any inference which may be drawn
17 from such fact.
18 To draw an inference means to infer, find,
19 conclude that a fact exists or does not exist based upon
20 proof of some other fact or facts.
21 So, for example, suppose you go to bed one night
22 and it is not raining, and when you wake up in the morning,
23 you look out your window. You do not see rain, but you see
24 that the street and sidewalk are wet, and that people are
25 wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. Under those

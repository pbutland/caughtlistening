Jury Charge

1       law that apply in all criminal trials:  The presumption of
2       innocence, the burden of proof and the requirement of proof
3       beyond a reasonable doubt.
4                 Throughout these proceedings, the Defendant is
5       presumed to be innocent.  As a result, you must find the
6       Defendant not guilty, unless, on the evidence presented at
7       this trial, you conclude that the People have proven the
8       Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
9                 In determining whether the People have satisfied
10       their burden of proving the Defendant's quilt beyond a
11       reasonable doubt, you may consider all of the evidence
12       presented, whether by the People or by the Defendant.
13                 In doing so, however, remember that, even though
14       the Defendant introduced evidence, the burden of proof
15       remains on the People.
16                 The fact that the Defendant did not testify is
17       not a factor from which any inference unfavorable to the
18       Defendant may be drawn.
19                 The Defendant is not required to prove that he is
20       not guilty.  In fact, the Defendant is not required to
21       prove or disprove anything.  To the contrary, the People
22       have the burden of proving the Defendant guilty beyond a
23       reasonable doubt.  That means, before you can find the
24       Defendant guilty of a crime, the People must prove beyond a
25       reasonable doubt every element of the crime including that

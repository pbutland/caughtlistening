1 articles is actually true.
2 There were other exhibits which contained hearsay
3 and were not accepted for the truth of the matter asserted
4 but for another purpose.
5 For example, there were several National Enquirer
6 headlines and an invoice from Investor Advisory Services
7 which is People’s 161 in evidence. Those were accepted for
8 the limited purpose of demonstrating that the articles were
9 published and the document created.
10 There were also some text messages that were
11 accepted with a similar limitation.
12 For example, People’s Exhibit 171—A with respect
13 to Gina Rodriguez’s texts only and 257 with respect to
14 Chris Cuomo’s texts only.
15 Those text messages were accepted for the limited
16 purpose of providing context for the responses by Dylan
17 Howard and Michael Cohen.
18 The exhibits which were accepted into evidence
19 with a limiting instruction are 152, l53—A, l53—B, l53—C,
20 161, l7l—A, 180, 181 and 257.
21 If you have any additional questions or need
22 clarification as to which exhibits were accepted into
23 evidence with limitations, just send me a note with your
24 question and I will be happy to clarify.

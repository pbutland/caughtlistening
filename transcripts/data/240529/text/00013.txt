Jury Charge
4828
1       the Defendant is the person who committed that crime.
2                 The burden of proof never shifts from the People
3       to the Defendant.
4                 If the People failed to satisfy their burden of
5       proof, you must find the Defendant not guilty, and if the
6       People satisfy their burden of proof you must find the
7       Defendant guilty.
8                 What does our law mean when it requires proof of
9       guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?
10                 The law uses the term of proof beyond a
11       reasonable doubt to tell you how convincing the evidence of
12       guilt must be to permit a verdict of guilty.
13                 The law recognizes that in dealing with human
14       affairs, there are very few things in this world that we
15       know with absolute certainty.  Therefore, the law does not
16       require the People to prove a defendant guilty beyond all
17       possible doubt.
18                 On the other hand, it is not sufficient to prove
19       that the Defendant is probably guilty.  In a criminal case,
20       the proof of guilt must be stronger than that.  It must be
21       beyond a reasonable doubt.
22                 A reasonable doubt is an honest doubt of the
23       Defendant's guilt for which a reason exists based upon the
24       nature and the quality of the evidence.  It is an actual
25       doubt, not an imaginary doubt.  It is a doubt that a

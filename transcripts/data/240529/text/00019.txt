Jury Charge

1       are not proof of what happened.  You may use evidence of a
2       prior inconsistent statement only to evaluate the
3       truthfulness or accuracy of the witness's testimony here at
4       trial.
5                 You may consider whether a witness's testimony is
6       consistent with the testimony of other witnesses or with
7       other evidence in the case.
8                 If there were inconsistencies by or among
9       witnesses, you may consider whether they were significant
10       inconsistencies related to important facts, or instead were
11       the kind of minor inconsistencies that one might expect
12       from multiple witnesses to the same event.
13                 You have heard testimony about the prosecution
14       and defense counsel speaking to a witness about the case
15       before the witness testified at this trial.
16                 The law permits the prosecution and defense
17       counsel to speak to a witness about the case before the
18       witness testifies, and the law permits the prosecutor and
19       defense counsel to review with the witness the questions
20       that will or may be asked at trial, including the questions
21       that may be asked on cross-examination.
22                 You have also heard testimony that a witness read
23       or reviewed certain materials pertaining to this case
24       before the witness testified at trial.  The law permits a
25       witness to do so.

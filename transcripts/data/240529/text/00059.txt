Jury Charge
4874
1   team can stand there, with one member of the Prosecution
2   team.
3            THE COURT:  That's what I have done in the past.
4            MS. HOFFINGER:  It's literally just opening the
5   laptop, it's a sub folder and each is designated.
6            THE COURT:  All right.
7            We will do it that way then, okay.
8            MS. HOFFINGER:  Okay.  Thank you.
9            (Side bar concluded.)
10            *******
11            THE COURT:  Jurors, I was just clarifying how we
12   were going to handle the evidence.
13            And I was told that there is a laptop that contains
14   all of the evidence, that everything that was introduced
15   into evidence during the course the trial is contained on
16   that laptop.
17            I need one or two volunteers to be shown how to
18   operate that laptop.
19            If you can just raise your hand.
20            Okay, juror number four and juror number six.
21            All right.  You will be shown in a minute how to
22   operate that.
23            I'm going to ask you to step out now to begin your
24   deliberations.
25            In the meantime, the six alternates, if you could

1   quiet as possible."
2            MR. BLANCHE:  Even on the page before, your
3   Honor, if you look at 1025, starting at Line 14, it's not
4   Mr. Pecker talking about the meeting. It's him giving
5   instruction to Mr. Howard, asking him to notify the West
6   Coast Bureau Chief.
7            So, it's execution, as opposed to just what
8   happened at the meeting.
9            THE COURT:  Mr. Steinglass.
10            MR. STEINGLASS:  Actually, I agree that that
11   paragraph -- it's a three-paragraph answer.
12            That middle paragraph seems to be beyond the
13   response. I just didn't think it was practical to cut out
14   the middle paragraph in the middle of an answer.
15            We could.
16            THE COURT:  So, we're in agreement that that
17   paragraph can be cut out?
18            MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
19            THE COURT:  Line 14 to Line 21.
20            MR. STEINGLASS:  Sure.
21            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
22            THE COURT:  We're not done.
23            MR. BLANCHE:  Understood.
24            THE COURT:  So, we're in agreement on that
25   paragraph.

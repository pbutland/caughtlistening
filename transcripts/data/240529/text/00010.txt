1       assessing Michael Cohen's credibility and to help provide
2       context for some of the surrounding events.  You may
3       consider that evidence for those purposes only.
4                 Likewise, you will recall that you heard
5       testimony that Michael Cohen pled guilty to violating the

25       evidence that any of the assertions contained in the

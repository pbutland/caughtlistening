Jury Charge
4872
1 jurors to step aside, and I am going to excuse the 12 jurors
2 and I will give the instruction that you just raised.
3 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you very much.
4 THE COURT: All right. Thank you very much.

7 THE COURT: One clarification.
8 I indicated that juror notes should be signed by
9 the foreperson. I meant for you to indicate Juror Number
10 one, all right, and not your name, but just that it's coming
11 from the foreperson.
12 Do not sign with your actual name, all right.
13 You are going to begin the only active part of your
14 jury service, you will begin the process of deliberations.
15 Again, you will be given some blank notes. If
16 there is anything that you need, if you have any questions,
17 just let me know.
18 When you send me a note, please be sure to include
19 your name as the foreperson, also include the date and the
20 time. It's very important for us.
21 Actually, I have one more question. Please
22 approach.

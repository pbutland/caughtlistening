Jury Charge
4879
1   believe it was somebody from the DA's office, but,
2   Mr. Blanche, you were standing there while this was
3   happening; is that right?
4            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, your Honor.  Correct.
5            THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to be in the
6   robing room for a little while, just in case we get a quick
7   note, and then I will probably just go upstairs.
8            I do direct all of you that you please be here; you
9   cannot leave the building.
10            And we need you all to be ready to get here quickly
11   if we receive a note.
12            MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
13            MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you.
14            THE COURT:  All right.

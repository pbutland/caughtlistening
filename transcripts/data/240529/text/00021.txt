Jury Charge

1       not be convicted of any crime upon the testimony of an
2       accomplice, unless it is supported by corroborative
3       evidence tending to connect the Defendant with the
4       commission of that crime.
5                 In other words, even if you find the testimony of
6       Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the
7       Defendant solely upon that testimony unless you also find
8       that it was corroborated by other evidence tending to
9       connect the Defendant with the commission of the crime.
10                 The corroborative evidence need not, by itself,
11       prove that a crime was committed or that the Defendant is
12       guilty.  What the law requires is that there be evidence
13       that tends to connect the Defendant with the commission of
14       the crime charged in such a way as may reasonably satisfy
15       you that the accomplice is telling the truth about the
16       Defendant's participation in that crime.
17                 In determining whether there is the necessary
18       corroboration, you may consider whether there is material,
19       believable evidence, apart from the testimony of Michael
20       Cohen, which itself tends to connect the Defendant to the
21       commission of the crime.
22                 You may also consider whether there is material,
23       believable evidence, apart from the testimony of Michael
24       Cohen, which, while it does not itself tend to connect the
25       Defendant with the commission of the crime charged, it

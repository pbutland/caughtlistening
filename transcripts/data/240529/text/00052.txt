Jury Charge
4867
1 Please use the form to record your verdict with an
2 "X" or a check mark in the appropriate place.
3 In addition to listing the counts, I have added
4 some additional language on the verdict sheet in order to
5 distinguish the counts.
6 You will notice that I have indicated whether a
7 count pertains to an invoice, a voucher or a check.
8 For the invoices, I have added the date and for the
9 vouchers and checks I have added the number.
10 The sole reason for doing this is to help you
11 distinguish between the various counts.
12 It is not a substitute for my full instructions on
13 the meaning and elements of each charge, and it should not
14 discourage you from asking me to define a crime again if a
15 question about it arises.
16 Finally, there are a few remaining rules which you
17 must observe during your deliberations.
18 First, while you are here in the courthouse,
19 deliberating on the case, you will be kept together in the
20 jury room.
21 You may not leave the jury room during
22 deliberations.
23 Lunch, of course, be provided.
24 If you have a cell phone or other electronic
25 device, please give it to a court officer or the sergeant to

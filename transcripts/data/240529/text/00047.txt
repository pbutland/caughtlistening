4 reasonable doubt either one or both of these elements, you
5 must find the Defendant not guilty of this crime.
6 Let me now explain motive, and in particular, the
7 difference between motive and intent.
8 Intent means conscious objective or purpose. Thus,
9 a person commits a crime —— a criminal act with intent, when
10 that person's conscious objective or purpose is to engage in
11 the act which the law forbids or to bring about an unlawful
12 result.
13 Motive, on the other hand, is the reason why a
14 person chooses to engage in criminal conduct.
15 If intent is an element of a charged crime, that
16 element must be proved by the People beyond a reasonable
17 doubt.
18 In this case, intent is, as I have explained, an
19 element of the crime of Falsifying Business Records in the
20 First Degree.

22 charged.
23 Therefore, the People are not required to prove a
24 motive for the commission of the charged crimes.
25 Nevertheless, evidence of a motive, or evidence of

Jury Charge

1   We will figure out the other days going forward.
2            It is unlikely, however, that even if we do work
3   late that we would work beyond 6:00 on any night.
4            I should explain that, under our law, I am not
5   permitted to have a conversation about the facts of the
6   case, or a possible verdict, or the vote of the jury on any
7   count, with any one juror, or group of jurors, or even all
8   of the jurors.
9            Thus, in any note that you send to me, do not tell
10   me what the vote of the jury is on any count.
11            If a juror wants to speak to me during
12   deliberations, a meeting here in the courtroom with the
13   parties will be arranged.
14            No juror, however, can tell me what is being said
15   about the facts of the case, or a possible verdict, or what
16   the vote of any juror or the jury is on any count.
17            And, while I will, of course, listen to whatever a
18   juror has to say that does not involve those subjects, I may
19   not be able to respond to that juror if the response
20   involves instructions on the law.
21            I may be required to call into court the entire
22   jury and respond by speaking to the entire jury.
23            The reason for that is that our law wants to make
24   sure that each and every juror hears, at exactly the same
25   time, whatever I have to say about the law, and our law

1       not have, a motive to lie.
2                 If I witness had a motive to lie, you may
3       consider whether and to what extent, if any, that motive
4       affected the truthfulness of that witness's testimony.
5                 If a witness did not have a motive to lie, you
6       may consider that as well in evaluating the witness's
7       truthfulness.
8                 You may consider whether a witness hopes for or
9       expects to receive a benefit for testifying.  If so, you
10       may consider whether and to what extent it affected the
11       truthfulness of the witness's testimony.

15                 You are not required to reject the testimony of
16       an interested witness, or to accept the testimony of a
17       witness who has no interest in the outcome of the case.

19       the outcome, or the lack of such interest, affected the
20       truthfulness of the witness's testimony.
21                 You may consider whether a witness has been
22       convicted of a crime or has engaged in criminal conduct,
23       and if so, whether and to what extent it affects your
24       evaluation of the truthfulness of that witness's testimony.

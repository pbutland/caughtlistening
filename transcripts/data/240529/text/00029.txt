Jury Charge

1                   *******
2             (The following proceedings are continued from the
3         preceding page.)
4            THE COURT:  (Continuing.)
5            Although you must conclude unanimously that the
6   Defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of
7   any person to a public office by unlawful means, you need
8   not be unanimous as to what those unlawful means were.
9            In determining whether the Defendant conspired to
10   promote or prevent the election of any person to a public
11   office by unlawful means, you may consider the following:
12             One, violations of the Federal Election Campaign
13   Act, again, otherwise known as FECA;
14            Two, the falsification of other business records;
15         or, three, violation of tax laws.
16            The first of the People's theories of "unlawful
17   means," which I will now define for you is the Federal
18   Election Campaign Act.
19            Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, it is
20   unlawful for an individual to willfully make a contribution
21   to any candidate with respect to any election for Federal
22   office, including the office of President of the United
23   States, which exceeds a certain limit.
24            In 2015 and 2016, that limit was $2,700.
25            It is also unlawful under the Federal Election

1 A Give or take.
2 Q And so, this was your career for over 20 years:
3 Writing, acting, and directing sex films; right?
4 A Yes.
5 Q So, you have a lot of experience in making phony
6 stories about sex appear to be real; right?
7 A Wow. I’m a —— (Laughter.) That's not how I would put
8 it.
9 The sex in the films, it’s very much real. Just like what
10 happened to me in that room.
11 Q All right. But you're making fictionalized stories
12 about sex; you write those stories?
13 A No. The sex is real. The character names might be
14 different, but the sex is very real. That’s why it’s
15 pornography and that's a B movie.
16 Q Okay. But you testified on direct that these films
17 have plots; right?
18 A Some of them do, yes.
19 Q And the plots are fake; right?
20 A Some of them. Some of them are based on truth.
21 Q And they are movies; right?
22 A Of course.
23 Q And you’ve been writing those stories about sex;
24 right?
25 A Yes.

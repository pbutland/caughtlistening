Westerhout - Direct/Mangold
2996
1   spoke at least weekly.  Sometimes daily.  But that trickled off
2   as I kind of grew in the role and the contacts kind of shifted
3   over to more of the White House side.
4       Q.   And, in total, how many communications would you say
5   you had with The Trump Organization in 2017, a rough estimate?
6            Is it fair to say it was dozens of communications?
7       A.   Dozens.
8       Q.   Now, one of the things you just mentioned was
9   Mr. Trump's contacts; right?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   And did you get guidance from Ms. Graff on contacts
12   that were important to Mr. Trump?
13       A.   Yes.
14                 MS. MANGOLD:  Can we show the jury what is in
15        evidence as People's Exhibit 68.  And can we blow up the
16        top portion of the page.  All of the portions.
17                 (Displayed.)
18       Q.   Ms. Westerhout, do you recognize this?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   What is this?
21       A.   It's an email exchange between Rhona and myself.
22       Q.   And looking at the bottom-most email on the chain, who
23   is that from?
24       A.   From me to Rhona.
25       Q.   What is date of that email?

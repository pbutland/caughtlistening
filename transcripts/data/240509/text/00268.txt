1 completely different version of events.
2 And, yes, we discredited her. And I am going to
3 turn to that in minute.
4 THE COURT: When you are saying a completely
5 different set of events, what specifically are you referring
6 to?
7 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, there are several.
8 THE COURT: Look, just give me the main one.
9 MR. BLANCHE: I will give a handful.
10 So, for example, she testified at Transcript
11 Page 2610 yesterday about the incident, where she said: "At
12 first I was just startled. Like jump scared. I wasn't
13 expecting someone to be there. He's, essentially, minus a
14 lot of clothing. That's when I had this moment where I felt
15 the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically
16 leaving my hands and my feet and almost like if you stand up
17 too fast, and everything kind of spins. That happened too.
18 Then I just thought, oh, my God, what did I misread to get
19 here? Because the intention was pretty clear."
20 Now, what she had previously said and, again —— now
21 I'm getting more to the mistrial motion. But, the only
22 reason why her testimony was admissible, according to the
23 Court's ruling prior to trial, was to President Trump's
24 motive and intent, the coconspirator's motive and intent,
25 and what they knew at the time.

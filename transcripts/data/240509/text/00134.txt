S. Daniels - Recross/Necheles
2914
1   telling your account of what happened with Mr. Trump has made
2   you money, and I think you said it also cost you a lot of
3   money.
4            Do you remember saying that?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    Can you explain that?
7       A    I have had to higher security, take extra precautions,
8   tutors for my daughter, had to move my daughter to a safe place
9   to live.  I had to move a couple of times.
10            And I lost -- I didn't -- I lost -- had a judgment on
11   automatic attorney fees because my case from the NDA was thrown
12   out.  And I appealed it, and it was dismissed again.  So
13   attorney's fees are automatically awarded in those kinds of
14   instances.
15       Q    Let me ask you a question:  Ms. Daniels, on balance,
16   has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with
17   Mr. Trump had a net positive or a net negative in your life?
18                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection, your Honor.
19                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       A    Negative.
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Nothing further.
22                 Thank you.
23                 THE COURT:  Any recross?
24                 MS. NECHELES:  Yes.

M. Westerhout - Direct/Mangold
3011
1       Q    And what did you do when you received the checks?
2       A    The checks came in a FedEx envelope. Um, so I opened
3   the envelope. And inside was a manila folder with a stack of
4   checks. And I brought the manila folder in to the President for
5   him to sign.
6       Q    And was there anything else besides checks that were
7   contained in the manila folder?
8       A    Um, I didn't really dig around in the folder, but, um,
9   I believe there were invoices attached to some of the checks
10   sometimes.
11       Q    And the checks that you received from Mr. Schiller,
12   you received unsigned checks; is that right?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    You said you brought the checks in to Mr. Trump for
15   his signature?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    How frequently did you receive a package of checks for
18   Mr. Trump to sign?
19       A    I don't recall how frequently, but it was, um,
20   consistent. Maybe twice a month?
21       Q    And how many checks, approximately, came in a packet?
22       A    It depended. Sometimes there was -- sometimes there
23   was one. Sometimes there was a stack, maybe half-an-inch thick.
24   I never counted them.
25       Q    Was it ever more than half-an-inch thick or was it

Proceedings

1 only witness that is really the subject of the Gag Order is
2 Mr. Cohen.
3 And so, as far as the Court's concern about this
4 proceeding, it should give way to the testimony of the past
5 couple of days.
6 I mean, he's going to be asked repeatedly over the
7 next week or two about these new accusations of consent and
8 of what happened that night.
9 And as the Gag Order stands now, he's not allowed
10 to say, "I did not do that."
11 So there are voters out there and there are
12 questioners who will ask him questions about it, and he
13 can't say anything.
14 His —— the other side can say things. And they
15 already have.
16 There are numerous news articles about it. Many
17 articles, your Honor, today, just based on yesterday.
18 (Indicating.)
19 I haven't checked the news today.
20 But there is no doubt that there will be a feature
21 of political shows tonight and articles. And it cannot be
22 that he cannot respond to that, your Honor, now that she's
23 off the stand, especially because this isn't just the same
24 story that has been going around for the past several years.
25 It's much different.

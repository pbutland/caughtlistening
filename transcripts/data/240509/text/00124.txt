S. Daniels - Redirect/Hoffinger
2904
1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  The question is, the motive to
2       fabricate.  They indicated her motive to fabricate was
3       after 2008.  It's more recently.  It's -- the
4       indictments -- it's going on these tours.  It doesn't have
5       to predate every motive to fabricate.  She -- they brought
6       up much later the alleged notice to fabricate.
7                 MS. NECHELES:  I would say that's not correct.
8                 THE COURT:  I am going to run on the side of the
9       caution and deny the application.
10                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Can we bring out some of details
11       that are consistent to rebut the inference that out of
12       context there are these inconsistencies?
13                 THE COURT:  You can go back to anything that was
14       taken out of context and address it in full context.
15                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I can ask her all the things she
16       did tell.
17                 THE COURT:  No.  No.  You can go back and address
18       the things that were taken out of context and put them in
19       context.
20                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I should be able to ask what
21       things she did tell him, Anderson Cooper.  She didn't tell
22       him all the details.  There was a number of details that
23       were asked and answered that she testified to here.
24                 I should be able to do exactly what Ms. Necheles
25       did.

S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2850
1                THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       Q    And in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you
3   said that -- well, you testified yesterday that when you were
4   asked to dinner, you said, "No fucking way;" right?
5       That's what you testified on Tuesday; right?
6       A    Correct.
7       Q    But in your 2011 interview with In Touch Magazine, you
8   said that Donald Trump himself asked if you would have dinner
9   with him; right?
10       A    Like I said, a bodyguard or a handler is a unit.
11       Q    And --
12       A    Someone who is speaking on your behalf is the same as
13   being asked directly.
14       Q    And you told the interviewer that you said "Of course;"
15   right?
16       A    Uh-huh.
17       Q    Right.  So you said, "Then he asked me if I wanted
18   to have dinner that night and I was like, yeah, of course;"
19   right?
20       A    Yes.  Those were the words of my publicist, actually,
21   who said go to dinner with him.  He's fascinating.  What's the
22   worst that could happen?
23       Q    Well, that's what you said that you responded to
24   President Trump that night; right?
25       A    This is an entertainment magazine.  It is very short

S. Daniels - Redirect/Hoffinger
2906
1       Q    And you did also provide details of what happened in
2   the room, didn't you?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    And, for example, you told him that Mr. Trump told
5   you -- never told you to keep it confidential?
6                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection, your Honor.
7                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
8                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
9                 record.)
10                 MS. NECHELES:  These are none of the things I
11       asked about.  She is just going through, generally, things
12       that are consistent with what she testified about.  I never
13       asked about this.
14                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I am filling out, around Ms.
15       Necheles' questions.  I only have a few.  Not every single
16       thing.
17                 THE COURT:  What makes it a little bit unique is
18       that she is not trying to use a prior consistent statement.
19       She is using the same exact document that you used and you
20       left the jury with a certain impression.
21                 Now, I don't want you to go full board and try to
22       rehabilitate the prior inconsistent statements.
23                 MS. NECHELES:  These are not ones I addressed.
24                 She is going to things that have nothing to do
25       with what I addressed.  I agree, if I raised an issue, if

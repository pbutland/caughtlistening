Westerhout - Direct/Mangold
2989
1       A.   After a few weeks, he kind of moved his working space
2   into a room off of the side of the Oval Office, known as the
3   dining room.  He really just, I remember, wanted to keep the
4   Resolute Desk very pristine and kind of keep that more for
5   meetings.
6            Then he spent most of the time when he was working,
7   reading, going over documents in the dining room.  And that was
8   really his working office.
9       Q.   Were the hard copy documents that he liked to review
10   kept in the dining room?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Was there an organization system there?
13       A.   To my understanding, the President knew where things
14   were and he kept it organized.  But he did have a lot of papers
15   and often brought things back and forth to his residence or Air
16   Force One or Marine One.  I thought he always knew where things
17   were.
18       Q.   In general, is he the type of person who would pay
19   attention to details?
20       A.   In my experience, yes.
21       Q.   How about his signature practices?  Did he have to sign
22   things that you saw in that first year in 2017?
23       A.   He did.
24       Q.   Did he use an automated signature or prefer to sign
25   himself?

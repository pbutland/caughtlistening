1                And she then is questioned about President Trump
2       spanking -- being asked to be spanked during the incident.
3                 Again, how that's relevant to why we're here, when
4       you -- especially when you weigh it and compare it to the
5       prejudicial nature of that sort of testimony.
6                It almost defies belief that we're here about a
7       records case and the Government is asking questions about an
8       incident that happened in 2006, which we deny even happened,
9       and a series of questions about rolling up a magazine and
10       spanking him.
11                The Court then warned the Government at the break
12       and said that the degree of detail that we're going into
13       here is unnecessary, we don't need to know the details, what
14       the suite looked like or anything like that, please move
15       along more quickly.
16                And the Government said, Okay.
17                They did not do that, your Honor.
18                Instead, they -- there was extensive testimony --
19       and, again, this is extremely prejudicial testimony.
20                This is not a case about -- this is not a case
21       about sex.
22                This isn't a case about whether that incident took
23       place or didn't take place.  Presumably, the NDA can be
24       entered and was entered.  We completely denied it.
25                Ms. Daniels said it happened, the NDA was entered.

1                Yet, for some unexplained reason, which I still
2       don't understand, there was no objection to certain
3       testimony, which was later used in the motion for a mistrial
4       on Tuesday, and again used today.
5                For example, the mention of the condom.  I agree
6       that shouldn't have come out.
7                I wished those questions hadn't been asked, and I
8       wished those answers hadn't been given.
9                But for the life of me, I don't know why
10       Ms. Necheles didn't object.
11                She had just made about ten objections, most of
12       which were sustained.
13                Why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of
14       a condom?
15                I don't understand.
16                We continue.
17                Ms. Daniels made clear in her testimony, and I
18       direct you now to Page 2611, that she was not drunk or
19       drugged or in any way coerced.
20                Again, this is Page 2611.
21                And for some reason, I don't know why, you went
22       into it ad nauseam on cross-examination.
23                I had sustained any objections related to that.
24       The witness herself had backed off and said, hey, listen, I
25       don't mean to suggest for a second that this was coerced or

1 did you interact with Mrs. Trump?
2 A I did, yes.
3 Q Were you familiar with their relationship?
4 A Yes.
5 Q How would you describe their relationship?
6 A I —— I believe they have a relationship of mutual
7 respect. Um, I —— I just found their relationship really, um,
8 special.
9 I know he cares a lot about her opinion. There was really
10 no one else that could kind of put him in his place, too.
11 So, he was my boss, but she was definitely the one in
12 charge.
13 But, I —— I just remember thinking that their relationship
14 was really special.
15 They laughed a lot when she came in to the Oval Office. Um.
16 And he would, you know, once in a while tell me to call her and
17 let her know that he was running late. Just like any other
18 marriage. Like, "Honey, I’m going to be late for dinner."
19 She would call me sometimes and say, "It's past dinnertime.
20 When is my husband coming home?"
21 So, I just really respected their relationship.
22 Q Did anything about their relationship change after the
23 Stormy Daniels story came out?
24 A Not that I saw, no.
25 Q At some point, did you leave the White House job?

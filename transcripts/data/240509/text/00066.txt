3 Q And am I correct that you said to In Touch Magazine
4 that when you first met Donald Trump, it was actually on the
5 golf course?
6 A Yes.
7 Q And that: "Later when he was in the gift room, he came
8 to talk to me and asked for my number and I gave it to him."
9 Do you recall saying that to In Touch Magazine?
10 A Yes.
11 Q So you said that, in that Magazine in 2011, you said it
12 was Donald Trump who asked you for your number, right, not Keith
13 Schiller?
14 A I didn't specify. I left out the names of all of the
15 other people not to get them involved, that's why I specifically
16 said just "he" asked.
17 Q All right.
18 A But he was there. They were together.
19 Q All right. So, didn't you say: "The first time I met
20 him was actually on the golf course;" right?
21 You said that?
22 A Uh—huh.
23 Q And when you said that, the "he" you were referring to
24 was Donald Trump; right?
25 A Keith was there as well, yes.

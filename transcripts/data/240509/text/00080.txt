S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles

1       A    I'm saying a -- once again, I had dinner in his room,
2   but we never got our food.  And I never ate anything.
3       Q    Okay.
4       A    Having dinner with somebody, at least where I'm from,
5   doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put food in your
6   mouth.  I'm going to someone's house for dinner.  It's
7   dinnertime.
8       Q    And isn't it a fact that when you wrote your book, you
9   said you walked from your hotel to President Trump's hotel?
10       A    I walked halfway there or I -- actually, I think I went
11   in the opposite direction first.
12       Q    And you don't say anything in your book about taking a
13   car; right?
14       A    I don't remember exactly.
15       Q    But when you were interviewed by the Prosecutors in
16   this case, the first time, you told them that President Trump's
17   bodyguard sent a car to pick you up and take you to the room;
18   didn't you?
19       A    I don't know how the car got there or who sent it
20   specifically.  I have no way of knowing who I was speaking to,
21   who -- or who sent the car.
22       Q    Well, when you testified on Tuesday, you said that you
23   called a car -- you said you walked and then you said you called
24   a car?
25       A    I called for a car?  I don't know how the car was

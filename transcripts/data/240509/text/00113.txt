Colloquy
2893
1                 Certainly, your Honor has ruled that these types
2       of threats can be elicited in a proper context.  They have
3       cross-examined throughly on the fact that, one, it attempts
4       to undermine the threat in 2018 in the parking lot.  These
5       are in some ways corroborative of that.
6                 Second, they have cross-examined extensively
7       about the fact that she was only doing all of this to make
8       money, and even her testimony here, and her story is all
9       about money, undermining the fact that there are other
10       issues that have arisen in terms of the threats, and that
11       her whole reason to testify here is not purely about money
12       and that there have been other costs.
13                 In fact, Ms. Necheles asked about that, and
14       specifically about the money she made, all the money that
15       she had made off of this.
16                 MS. NECHELES:  Can I see it, the exhibit?
17                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It's J-2 and J-17.
18                 Susan, I don't have a copy for you.  It was
19       yours.
20                 Here is J-2 and then here is J-17.
21                 MS. NECHELES:  Thank you.
22                 MS. HOFFINGER:  We would like to elicit those.
23                 This one here, defense counsel can't use it as
24       both a sword and shield.  You can't fully -- you can't
25       elicit only what Ms. Daniels said and not show what it is

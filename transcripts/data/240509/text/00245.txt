4       A    Since the publication, yes.
5       Q    Can you briefly describe that for the jury?
6       A    Um, I -- he was at a fundraiser in Orange County,
7   where I lived, last Fall. And I hadn't seen him since I left

9       Q    Did you discuss this case at that time?
10       A    No, I did not.

12   fundraiser to say hello, and they said yes.
13       So, I got to see him then. (Crying).
14       Q    Have you spoken to him since that time?
15       A    No.

17                 THE COURT:  Your witness.

Proceedings

1 Mr. Trump was aware of those details.
2 And the fact that the testimony is prejudicial and
3 messy, according to Mr. Blanche, that is why Mr. Trump tried
4 so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about
5 this.
6 Notwithstanding all of that, we went out of our way
7 to eliminate the most salacious details in order to avoid
8 embarrassing the defendant, even though some of those
9 details are highly corroborative.
10 And, you know, there was a fair amount of detail
11 elicited about the room outside, the conversation, the
12 twoâ€”hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with Mr. Trump.
13 But do you know where there was not a lot of detail
14 elicited? The actual sexual encounter.
15 By my count, there are about eight questions about
16 it.
17 Most of them are yes or no answers.
18 There is no opportunity for long explanations about
19 it.
20 We tried very hard to respond to your Honor's
21 efforts to pull back the testimony and to not have a fulsome
22 description of the actual sexual act.
23 And, you know, despite the fact that the details of
24 that sexual act would corroborate her story, they were not
25 elicited.

1       understand the Court's ruling on that.
2                But, the fact of the matter is, is Ms. Necheles led
3       a very misleading impression, as Mr. Blanche is doing now,
4       that her story has somehow become radically different from
5       the way that it always was.
6                So, moving on to the actual mistrial motion.
7                It has always been the People's contention that the
8       details in this case, the details of the two-hour
9       conversation that Ms. Daniels had with the defendant in the
10       living room and the dining room of his hotel room in
11       Harrah's corroborate her account.
12                They corroborate, A, the fact that sex happened,
13       which increases the motivation to silence her.
14                I will point out a few things.
15                Well, the point here is that the details of her
16       story, both before and during the sexual act corroborate her
17       story.
18                That is the -- those are the kind of details that
19       make her account more credible.
20                Now, the defense has gone through great lengths to
21       try to discredit her, to try to claim that the sex never
22       happened.
23                And, incidentally, if they want to offer testimony
24       of the fact that the sex never happened, that's their
25       prerogative.

1 A Sure.
2 Q You prided yourself in what you considered your witty
3 answers, right?
4 A Uh—hum.
5 Q So, when the prosecutors put these up and talk about
6 how people were attacking you, you were attacking them right
7 back, right?
8 A I was defending myself.
9 Q And attacking them right back, right?
10 A I never attacked anybody first. The same with
11 Mr. Trump, I didn't say anything negative about him until he
12 did it to me.
13 Q And you are calling President Trump names there,
14 right?
15 A Yes.
16 Q And you are calling whoever asked this Twitter, or
17 posted this Twitter names, right?
18 A I said they sound dumb, as in the tweet is dumb. I
19 stand by that.
20 MS. NECHELES: If you can put that down and put
21 up J—17 for the witness and the parties.
22 And I offer this in evidence.
23 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.
24 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.
25 MS. NECHELES: We can show that.

3       Q.   Now, during that first year in the White House in 2017,
4   would you describe that as a transition period, that first year
5   that Mr. Trump was in the White House?
6       A.   Yes.  I think, you know, the first year of any
7   administration is a transition year.  We were all trying to
8   learn our way around and, you know, do the best work we could
9   for the American people.
10       Q.   And you and others were doing things for the first time
11   that year?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And was Mr. Trump busy that year?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Was he constantly being pulled in a lot of different
16   directions?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Based on your experience, were there things he
19   overlooked or forgot during that period?  Was he still attentive
20   to the things that were brought to his attention?
21       A.   My understanding is he was attentive to things that
22   were brought to his attention.
23       Q.   During that first year in the White House, in 2017,
24   when things were in transition, did you coordinate with The
25   Trump Organization?

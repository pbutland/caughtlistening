4       A    I don't know.
5       Q    And, now, in 2024, your story has changed; hasn't it?
6       A    No.  Not at all.  You are trying to make me say that it

8       Q    And I want to talk about the night after the evening

17   not, but there were parties in both hotels.
18       Q    Well, you testified --

20   for that.

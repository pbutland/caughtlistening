1                The claim of changing the story is also
2       extraordinarily untrue.
3                There may be, as with any witness recounting a
4       story, details that are said in one forum, but not in the
5       another forum. Things that were, you know, omitted in an
6       interview that was given for entertainment purposes versus
7       an interview that was given for, you know, a more fulsome
8       interview with Anderson Cooper in 2018 versus an interview
9       in preparation for trial testimony, which is more detailed
10       than any of those things, versus a documentary.
11                All of which the defense has had access to.
12                So, our first point here is that this is not a
13       change of story, as they have tried to characterize it.
14                  Second of all, to the extent that there were
15       inconsistencies, Ms. Necheles -- certainly, Ms. Necheles
16       certainly probed them in her very narrow, but somewhat
17       misleading cross-examination.
18                You will remember that she, in an attempt -- she
19       attempted to impeach Ms. Daniels with three or four
20       inconsistencies or omissions from the Anderson Cooper
21       interview, which were allowed.
22                We attempted to put in the rest of that interview
23       to show just how similar her testimony was to the account
24       that she gave Anderson Cooper in 2018.
25                And I'm not going to reargue the ruling, I

1       A    Yes.
2       Trump Tower was in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. It's
3   protected by Secret Service. And these people were coming in
4   for the most important interviews of their lives.
5       So, I took it upon myself to greet them downstairs so they
6   wouldn't get lost.
7       Q    Them calling you "the greeter girl" was a little bit
8   belittling your work; right?
9       A    Yeah.
10       I tried to not let it get to me. But -- I think people said
11   I was unqualified.
12       Q    Because you were doing work that was a lot more
13   important than just greeting people; right?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    But, that's how the press treated you at that time;
16   right?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And that's what the prosecutor just asked you about;
19   right?
20       A    (No response).
21       Q    On direct, she asked you if you were called "the
22   greeter girl"?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    This is a very busy and hectic time; right?
25       A    Yes.

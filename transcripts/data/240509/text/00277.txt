1                That is an extremely prejudicial statement by a
2       witness that was never said to -- there is no evidence that
3       that was said to AMI.
4                There was no evidence that that was said to
5       Mr. Cohen.  There was no evidence that that had anything to
6       do with the motive of anybody involved in this case to enter
7       into that NDA in 2016.
8                On the other hand, it's just extraordinarily
9       prejudicial for a jury to hear.
10                Shortly thereafter, 2611 to '12, the question is:
11       "What happened next, briefly?"  Okay.  There has already
12       been testimony -- the Court was clear with the Government to
13       not go into more than just the fact that it happened.
14                But, they didn't abide by the Court's rules.
15                "What happened next?"
16                And the witness says, "I think I blacked out.  I
17       wasn't drunk.  I just don't remember."
18                And then there was the questions that we talked
19       about yesterday, about how -- the size; how tall was he.
20                So, there is a question:  "So, he was standing up
21       and you were standing up.  What were your relative heights?"
22                 How is that relevant to this case?  That is so
23       prejudicial, and so incredible for a jury to hear the
24       Government ask a witness talking about what she's now saying
25       is a power move by the person who she's having sex with,

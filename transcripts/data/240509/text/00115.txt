S. Daniels — Redirect/Hoffinger
2895
1 MR. STEINGLASS: August of 2023.
2 MS. NECHELES: We object to that. That would be
3 so highly prejudicial.
4 We asked about what she wrote and the money she
5 made. Now, they want to put into evidence a tweet that has
6 nothing to do with her. It had nothing to do with her.
7 They are insinuating it had something to do with her,
8 things strangers have done.
9 THE COURT: You did a very effective job on your
10 cross—examination of calling into question her motivation.
11 That, specifically, you have left the jury with the
12 impression again, you did a good job —— that she is doing
13 all of this for money. She sold her story for money.
14 I think it’s fair for the People to try to
15 demonstrate that she has suffered injuries as a result of
16 that and what they look like.
17 I will allow it.
18 MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.
19 (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the
20 following occurred in open court.)
21 REDIRECT EXAMINATION
22 BY MS. HOFFINGER:

24 How are you?
25 A Good.

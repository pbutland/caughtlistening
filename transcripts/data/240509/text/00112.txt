Colloquy
2892
1                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
2                 MS. NECHELES:  I have no further questions.
3                 THE COURT:  Any redirect?
4                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Yes, I do.
5                 Actually, Judge, may we approach for a moment?
6                 THE COURT:  Yes.
7                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
8                 record.)
9                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, I want to be careful,
10       given your prior rulings.
11                 There are two exhibits I would like to put in,
12       Defense Exhibits, Ms. Necheles.  J-2 and J-17, they are
13       specifically tweets that you -- she elicited that Ms.
14       Daniels wrote and put on her Twitter.  But Ms. Necheles did
15       not elicit the tweets to which she was responding, which
16       are both threatening.
17                 For example, J-2, she specifically asked about
18       it.  It was responsive to a threat that she received on
19       that.  In fact, the witness answered that, but Ms. Necheles
20       did not put it in evidence.
21                 And so, frankly, we feel that the jury needs to
22       have the full context on those.  I would like to admit one
23       of them.
24                 On the second one, I would like to at least
25       elicit a question about what her tweet was in response to.

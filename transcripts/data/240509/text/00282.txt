Proceedings
3062
1                THE COURT:  All right.  I mean, let me hear from
2       the People, please.
3                MR. BLANCHE:  I have many, many more, but I will
4       stop.
5                THE COURT:  I appreciate that, but let me hear from
6       the People.
7                MR. STEINGLASS:  Okay.  So that was a lot that
8       Mr. Blanche said.
9                Most of it just flat out untrue.  Starting with the
10       fact that this is a new account.
11                This is not a new account.
12                This account has been documented in many previous
13       interviews, which the defense has had access to, and used
14       somewhat effectively and somewhat misleadingly on
15       cross-examination.
16                Not the least of which is, at least half the things
17       that Mr. Blanche has said that they didn't know was coming
18       are included in the exhaustive typed interview notes that
19       were taken in a December interview with Ms. Daniels, and
20       shared with counsel promptly after that interview.
21                Those details were elicited in the Anderson Cooper
22       interview.
23                They were elicited in numerous other interviews,
24       all of which the defense has access to.
25                So the claim of ambush is just nonsense.

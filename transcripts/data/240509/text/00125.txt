5                 Let's continue.  Step back.
6                      (Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the

8                 THE COURT:  Ms. Hoffinger, you can clarify to the
9       extent that was discussed and to that extent only.
10   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
11       Q    Ms. Necheles asked about certain things that you
12   didn't tell Anderson Cooper at the time.
13            Do you remember that?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    But there were many things that you did tell Anderson
16   Cooper, did you not?
17                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection.
18                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
19       Q    And in terms of the context, you did tell Anderson
20   Cooper that you had sex with Mr. Trump in the hotel room?
21                 MS. NECHELES:  Objection, your Honor.
22                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
23                 MS. NECHELES:  Your Honor, I think this is not
24       what I asked.
25                 THE COURT:  Overruled.

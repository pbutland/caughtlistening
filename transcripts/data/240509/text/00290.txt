Proceedings
3070
1 be responsive to your Honor's concerns that we not go too
2 far into the details of the sexual encounter.
3 I'm going to say one more thing about this, which
4 is the argument —— this argument was thoroughly briefed by
5 the defense in their endeavor to keep this testimony out, as
6 well as similar testimony about Karen McDougal and Dino
7 Sajudin.
8 And, by the way, about Karen MacDougal, we didn't
9 change our minds about calling her.
10 She was on our witness list, but we had never
11 indicated an actual intention to call her. I am just
12 correcting Mr. Blanche.
13 We had never affirmatively indicated that we were
14 going to call her. She was like many people on our witness
15 list.
16 Anyway, back to what I was saying.
17 This issue was thoroughly briefed. And the Court,
18 mindful of the potential prejudice, limited the details of
19 the Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin story to just the fact
20 of the allegation and not the underlying details, but did
21 not make a similar limitation on the Stormy Daniels story
22 because, as the Court recognized, it was so intertwined with
23 the motive to silence her.
24 I'm just going to read very briefly from your
25 Honor's ruling.

3004
1       Q    And if a name appeared on this list, were you more
2   likely to patch that call through to Mr. Trump?
3       A    Um, yes. But I tried to -- yes.
4                 MS. MANGOLD:  All right.
5                 We can take that down.
6       Q    Now, I know we just saw the contact information for
7   Mr. Cohen.
8       Was it your understanding that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen had
9   a close relationship in 2017?
10       A    At that time, yes.
11       Q    Did Mr. Cohen ever visit the White House in 2017?
12       A    I believe he did, yes.
13                 MS. MANGOLD:  Can we show the witness, the
14        parties, and the Court what's been marked for
15        identification as People's Exhibit 391?
16                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
17        and the parties' screens.)
18       Q    Ms. Westerhout, do you see that on your screen?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Do you recognize it?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    What is that?
23       A    It's an email from me to Michael Cohen.
24       Q    Is it a true and correct copy of the email that you
25   sent to Michael Cohen?

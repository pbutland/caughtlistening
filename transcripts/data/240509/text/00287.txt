1 corroborates her story.
2 So what seems like a detail that is insignificant
3 and irrelevant to Mr. Blanche is not, as Ms. Necheles' cross
4 made perfectly clear; cherry—picking the details that she
5 thought were inconsistent and omitting the details that have
6 always been consistent.
7 So the overarching point here is that the details
8 are essential to give the jury the tools they need to
9 analyze her credibility.
10 And presenting only a generalized account
11 undermines her reliability as a witness because it affects
12 her ability to perceive and remember these details.
13 And Mr. Blanche complains about the fact that these
14 details are messy.
15 But, the point is —— and Mr. Blanche says, well,
16 she never said any of this to Michael Cohen or AMI in 2016.
17 She didn't speak to Mr. Cohen or AMI in 2016.
18 But you know who knew what happened in that room?
19 Mr. Trump knew.
20 And those details of what happened in that room,
21 those messy details, that is motive.
22 That was Mr. Trump's motive to silence this woman
23 before she could tell her story in 2016, less than a month
24 before the election.
25 So, these are not —— this is not irrelevant.

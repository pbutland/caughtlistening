Proceedings

1 And we alerted the Court and the Government that
2 Ms. Daniels was now making additional claims, contradicting
3 her previous claims that were made at the time that the NDA
4 was entered into, claiming that the —— that this, you know,
5 again, completely made—up encounter with President Trump may
6 have been non—consensual.
7 And we got that from the documentary that was
8 recently released and from a few pages of notes from
9 December when the People met with Ms. Daniels and gave us
10 the notes.
11 And then, as the Court knows, before the testimony
12 started, we objected again.
13 And the Court allowed —— indicated it would allow
14 testimony about it, but said that it was fine, but we don't
15 need to know the details of the intercourse; and
16 Ms. Hoffinger said that's correct.
17 And then, what proceeded to happen was a whole host
18 of questions that went way beyond just mere fact that it
19 happened.
20 And it included questions from the transcript at
21 Page 2592 asking about the fact that Ms. Daniels had a
22 difficult time growing up.
23 And, again, that was objected to, and it was
24 sustained; but that's a question that should have never been
25 asked.

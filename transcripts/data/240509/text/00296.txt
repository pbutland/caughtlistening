Proceedings

1                Look at Page 2592.
2                So she can't say that she didn't object because of
3       my ruling when, in fact, she did object at 2592.
4                However, there were many times, not once or twice,
5       but many times when Ms. Necheles could have objected, but
6       didn't.
7                And, here, I will direct your attention to Pages
8       2598 and 2610.
9                Now, after the Court sua sponte objects, and that
10       objection had to do with the reference to the trailer park,
11       I felt that wasn't necessary.
12                I felt that there was a certain amount of prejudice
13       to that.
14                There was no objection, so I sua sponte objected.
15       I didn't want that in.
16                And then I struck it from the record.
17                Following the Court's own objection, Ms. Necheles
18       then began to object with some frequency.
19                And virtually every single one of her objections
20       was sustained.
21                And every one of her applications that the answers
22       be stricken from the record were, in fact, stricken from the
23       record.
24                And I direct your attention now to Pages 2612
25       through 2615 for that.

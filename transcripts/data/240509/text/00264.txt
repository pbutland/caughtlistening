1       Ms. Daniels and other witnesses, clearly saying them with
2       the defendant in mind.
3                I'm not in a position to say that it's at his
4       direction or anything close to that.
5                But there are people making the defendant's case
6       for him out in the world.
7                We have been told repeatedly by witnesses, even in
8       the courtroom, even on the stand, we have seen the fear in
9       some of these witnesses.
10                The witness who just testified, a couple of times
11       broke in because there was an exhibit displayed on the
12       screen that had her home address.
13                And you could see the fear in her eyes when that
14       happened.
15                It was luckily not displayed to the public.  And
16       that's because of what this defendant is doing.  It's what
17       he has done in the past.
18                It's why this Order was issued.  The Order was not
19       issued lightly.
20                It was issued after we developed an extensive
21       record relating to the attacks this defendant mounts
22       indiscriminately for anyone that he deems worthy of his
23       venom.
24                He does it selfishly, with no concern about the
25       safety of the people he is attacking.

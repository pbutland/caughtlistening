5 A Yes.
6 Um, sometimes I would look down on my phone, and if the red
7 light was on, I knew that he was on the phone, but I hadn't

9 would kind of look up and look into the Oval Office, and there
10 were times when I could kind of figure out that he was on the
11 phone with Mrs. Trump.
12 And he would say, you know, "Honey, come over to the
13 window." And there was a window in the residence where you
14 could see from the residence into the Oval Office. And he
15 would say, "Come to the window," and they would kind of wave to
16 each other (waves).
17 When he was, you know, boarding Marine One on the South
18 Lawn, he would call Mrs. Trump and say, "Honey, I’m about to
19 board," which I always found funny. Like, of course she knows
20 his schedule. He just wanted to say hi and check in.

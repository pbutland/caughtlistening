1 application is denied.
2 I will hear you on the motion for a mistrial.
3 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we started this
4 conversation yesterday.
5 I made a motion yesterday, and I am making another
6 motion today.
7 We are also prepared, if it's helpful to the Court,
8 as we go through this, to put something in writing over the
9 weekend that further articulates why we believe that there
10 is simply no way that this case should go forward given the
ll testimony that happened, the past day with Ms. Daniels.
12 It's worth —— we mentioned it yesterday, but it's worth
13 mentioning it, that in your Honor's decision of March 18th
14 on Page 4, when you are explaining why Ms. Daniels testimony
15 is admissible at this trial, you, the Court says: "Daniels
16 not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated
17 the falsification of business records, but is also probative
18 of the defendant's intent."
19 "Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding
20 these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the
21 narrative of events and is necessary background for the
22 jury.
23 We then, thereafter, your Honor, put in a motion
24 for an adjournment based upon, in part, on Ms. Clifford's
25 recent change of story.

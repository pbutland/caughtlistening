1       Q    You're saying that's not you bragging about how you
2   are the Saint of a person who got President Trump indicted?
3       A    No. I'm not bragging.
4       I think it's funny that a store made those for me to sell,
5   so I put those on my site.
6       Q    And you're making $40 on each of those; right?
7       A    No.  I'm actually making about $7.

9       A    Yes.
10       Q    I show you what has been marked J-24 -- I'm sorry.

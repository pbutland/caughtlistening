1   you alone with Ben Roethlisberger, right?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And you testified on your cross-examination, just a

7       Q    And you said you hated that name, right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And that you never posted it yourself, right?
10       A    I never made any of those flyers.
11       Q    And you never posted it on your social media you
12   testified, right?
13       A    Sometimes they made me re-tweet them, but I never made
14   any of the flyers and posted them on my own accord.
15       Q    You said sometimes you may have had to re-tweet them
16   but that's it, right?

7       Q.   And what does the unredacted content of the page say?
8       A.   "I used to say go out and get the best people and trust
9   them.  Over the years, I've seen too many shenanigans.  Now I
10   say, get the best people and don't trust them.  Do not trust
11   them because if you don't know what you're doing, they're going
12   to rob you blind.  I know dozens of sophisticated business
13   people who hired accountants and lawyers and others and they
14   trusted them, they got killed.  They lost their business.  So I
15   say, get the best people and don't trust them."

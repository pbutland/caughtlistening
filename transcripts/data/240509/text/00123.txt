2 MS. NECHELES: Okay. I need Gedalia for that.
3 MR. STEINGLASS: Do you have a copy for us?
4 MS. NECHELES: No, I don’t. And it’s 44 N.Y. 2d.
5 269.
6 MR. STERN: So, it starts over here. It has to

12 It’s unfairly giving the jury an unfair

15 number of questions about what was told or not told to
16 Anderson Cooper.
17 THE COURT: I can’t read and listen to you guys

19 MS. HOFFINGER: I apologize.
20 When you are done, I wanted to add one thing.

24 MS. HOFFINGER: If you are admitting it ——
25 THE COURT: I haven’t decided yet.

Colloquy
2891
1       A    There was a lot of indictments.
2                 MS. NECHELES:  Your Honor, I move to strike that.
3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It is responsive, your Honor.
4                 THE COURT:  It's responsive.
5                 Overruled.
6   BY MS. NECHELES:
7       Q    Okay.
8            You don't know what he was indicted for in this case?
9   You don't have any idea?
10       A    Business records.
11       Q    And you know nothing about the business records,
12   right?
13       A    I know nothing about his business records, no.
14            Why would I?
15       Q    You know nothing about what he does, or does not know
16   about the business records, right?
17       A    No.
18       Q    And, Ms. Daniels, you have changed your story many
19   times.
20            And isn't it a fact that the reason you changed your
21   story many times is because you never had an affair with
22   President Trump, but realized that you could earn money by
23   saying you had an affair, and you have been doing that for 12
24   years?
25                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection to the form.

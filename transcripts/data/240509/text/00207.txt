1   in a day?
2       A.   A lot.
3       Q.   Do you know, approximately, when he started taking
4   calls in the day?
5       A.   I remember times where, you know, I knew he was taking
6   calls as early as 6 in the morning.
7       Q.   And when would he stop taking calls at the end of the
8   day?
9       A.   Again, it depended.  I recall times he would be on the
10   phone late into the night after I went to bed, so I always felt
11   guilty about that.
12       Q.   How did you call the President at work?  Can anybody
13   call the President of the United States.  Is this a more
14   complicated process?
15       A.   There is a rather complicated process.  If the
16   President is in the Oval Office and someone calls in and they
17   had my desk phone number, they could just call that number.  If
18   the President was available, I would patch them through.
19            If someone was calling in, John Smith, you know, off
20   the street and just calling 1-800 White House, obviously, they
21   wouldn't be patched through to the Oval Office.
22            But there were operators that took calls and then kind
23   of determined if that person was someone that needed to get
24   patched through either to myself or other members of the
25   President's staff.

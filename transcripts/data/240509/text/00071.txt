10 A It was minus some details. It is a short interview.
11 Q And then you —— and you further told the interviewer:
12 "Who would pass up an opportunity to talk to someone so
13 interesting;" right?
14 A Yes.
15 Q And so, that's what you said in 2011, that you were
16 happy to go to dinner with him. Immediately, you were happy to
17 go to dinner with President Trump; right?
18 A Yes.
19 Q And you testified on direct examination on Tuesday that
20 when you supposedly went to President Trump's hotel room, you
21 thought you were going out for dinner; right?
22 A Yes.
23 Q But your story is that even though you spent over three
24 hours in the hotel room, you never got any dinner; right?
25 A We never got any food.

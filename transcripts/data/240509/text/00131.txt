1       People's Exhibit 408-B.
2       Q    Ms. Daniels, this tweet by Mr. Trump was August 4th of
3   2023?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    And were you aware of this Truth Social post from
6   Mr. Trump when it came out?
7       A    Yes.  Sorry.
8       Q    Who did you understand Mr. Trump was directing this to
9   at the time?
10       A    I wasn't sure, but I thought it was me.
11       Q    In what way?
12       A    Um, do you want me to read it?
13       Q    No.  You can read it.
14       A    Okay.
15            Because it says, if you go after me, I am coming after
16   you, and this was right around the same time that he filed in
17   Florida, so it seemed to be connected, but I am not sure.
18       Q    That he filed in Florida the proceeding against you on
19   the legal fees?
20       A    Yes.
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down.  Thank
22       you.
23       Q    By the way, defense counsel asked you some questions
24   about whether you felt you were responsible for the charges in
25   this case.

1       Q    And when you are talking about "political power,"
2   you are talking about you fighting against President Trump;
3   right?
4       A    Keep in mind, I did not write this comic book.
5       Q    But you are selling it; right?
6       A    Yes.
7                 MS. NECHELES:  So we can take all of that down,
8        please.
9                 Thank you.
10       Q    A large part of your livelihood, for a bunch of years
11   now, has been making money off the story that you had sex with
12   President Trump and that you will help President Trump be
13   convicted; right?
14       A    No.
15       Q    Well, you testified on direct examination that there
16   are two books you are working on right now; right?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And what are those books about?
19       A    One is called "Rock Star Porn Star."  It is about my
20   partner.  He's a musician who became a porn star.
21       And the other one is a novel about a girl who grew up in
22   New Orleans.
23       It's nonfiction -- I'm sorry, it is fiction.
24       Q    And did that person, that girl in the novel, have an
25   affair with a presidential candidate?

1                MR. BLANCHE:  Just very briefly.
2                THE COURT:  Very briefly.
3                MR. BLANCHE:  I mean, Judge, what they are saying
4       is not true.
5                So, for example, the People just told you that
6       Ms. McDougal was not on the witness list --
7                THE COURT:  I'm not going to get bogged down on
8       that.
9                MR. BLANCHE:  But, Judge --
10                THE COURT:  It's not relevant to this motion.
11                That's why I'm saying, very quickly, whether she
12       was going to be called or not going to be called has nothing
13       to do with this motion for a mistrial.
14                MR. BLANCHE:  But it does, your Honor.
15                THE COURT:  No, it doesn't.
16                I am making the ruling, and I decide whether it
17       does or it doesn't.
18                I'm telling you, it doesn't.
19                Please have a seat so that I can render my
20       decision.
21                Following your motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, I
22       went back to chambers and I pulled out my decisions on both
23       motions in limine; the omnibus decision.
24                I also looked at the transcript from Tuesday's
25       proceedings.  I looked at that yesterday.

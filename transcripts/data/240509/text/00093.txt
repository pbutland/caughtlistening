S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2873
1       A    No.  I said the worst thing that he did was lie.
2   That's my feelings.
3       Q    Okay.  And you were also --
4       A    I blame myself --
5       Q    And you didn't say anything about --
6       A    -- for feeling that way.
7       Q    And you didn't say anything about feeling those things
8   that you just described happened?
9                MS. HOFFINGER:  Can you please let the witness
10       finish, your Honor.
11                THE COURT:  Overruled.  I think she was done.
12       Overruled.
13       A    And, I'm sorry, what did you say?
14       Q    You didn't say anything about feeling faint in there,
15   when this happened; right?
16       A    No.  Because the question was what Mr. Trump did.  And
17   Mr. Trump did not drug me.  And he did not -- that was how I
18   felt, the worst thing that he did was lie in that moment.
19       Q    Right.  And you were also interviewed by Vogue Magazine
20   in 2018; right?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And isn't it correct that you were asked:  "Did Trump
23   do something that made you feel like you had to have sex with
24   him?"  And you responded, "No, nothing;" right?
25       A    Yes.

1 book was written by which author?
2 A. Yes, there is. There are different sections. One of
3 the sections are called Zanker's Take. Also, the design of the
4 book. Zanker's Take has like a graph above it, so it separates
5 it out from Donald Trump's words.
6 Donald Trump's words, or at least the writing, is in a
7 sterile front, and Zanker's is a nonsterile front, a thinner
8 font. So you could tell the difference between the two.
9 Q. So, there are multiple ways for readers to tell which
10 author is speaking in a portion of the book?
11 A. Indicate which author is speaking.
12 MS. MANGOLD: Can you please publish for the jury
13 what is now in evidence as People's Exhibit 415A.

15 Q. Can you see that on your screen?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Is this an excerpt from the same book?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What page is this from?
20 A. 154.
21 Q. Based on your review of the book, is this from a
22 section of the Book attributed to Mr. Trump or Mr. Zanker?
23 A. Mr. Trump.
24 Q. Is that true of the rest of the exhibits that form part
25 of People's Exhibit 415?

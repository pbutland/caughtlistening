7   right?
8       A    Yeah.
9       I didn't have anything negative to say, so why would I
10   write it?
11       Q    You thought he was a great person to work for?

13       Q    And you thought he was a good President?

20       A    Yes.
21       Q    In fact, he was not your choice?

24   right?
25       A    Yes. That's right.

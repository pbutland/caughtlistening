1   had gotten out?
2       A    Can you repeat that?
3       Q    And the paper trail was out if the story had gotten
4   out?
5       A    Correct. With a target on my back and my family's.
6       It was the perfect solution.
7       Q    Am I correct, you told Weisberg another one of your
8   motives was your anger about Trump's opposition to abortion and
9   gay marriage?
10       A    No.
11       Q    You don't remember saying that to him?
12       A    I don't remember saying that. Bullshit.
13       Q    I want to direct your attention again to J-45 and --
14                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
15       Q    -- and Paragraph 2.
16                 THE COURT:  There's an objection.
17                 Overruled for now.
18                 MS. NECHELES:  I'm sorry. I didn't hear the
19        objection.
20                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness'
21        and the parties' screens.)
22       Q    Directing your attention to Paragraph 2.
23       Isn't it correct, you told him another motivation to go
24   public was your anger about Trump's newfound opposition to
25   abortion and gay marriage?

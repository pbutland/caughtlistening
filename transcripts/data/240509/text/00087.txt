S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2867
1       Q    And you testified on direct that Mr. Trump got out of
2   bed and stood between you and the door, to the exit of the
3   bedroom and said something like:  I thought we were getting
4   somewhere, we were talking and I thought you were serious about
5   what you wanted, if you ever want to get out of that trailer
6   park.
7       Those were his words that you said that he said?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And you said you blacked out and the next thing you
10   remember was being on the bed and having sex; right?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    But when you were interviewed in 2011 by In Touch
13   Magazine, you told a completely different story; didn't you?
14       A    No.
15       Q    Well, when you were interviewed in 2011, you said that
16   when you came out of the bathroom, Donald Trump was sitting on
17   the bed and he said, "Come here."
18       And you were like, "Oh, here we go."
19       And then you started kissing and had sex.
20       That's the story that you told in 2011; isn't it?
21       A    Like I said, there were parts in the middle that I
22   didn't remember.
23       Q    Well, isn't that the story that you told in 2011;
24   right?
25       A    I don't remember exactly what I said.

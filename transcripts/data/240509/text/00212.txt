13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Would he then edit sometimes the hard copy printout?
15 A. Sometimes, yes.

17 show it to him?
18 A. Sometimes.
19 Q. Did he have any particular preferences when it came to
20 the way that he wrote social media posts?
21 A. My recollection is that there were certain words that
22 he liked to capitalize. Words like "country." And he liked to
23 use exclamation points.
24 Q. Did he also periodically correct other punctuation,
25 like commas or comma locations?

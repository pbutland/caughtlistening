1 documentary and off of this story; right?
2 A Which I haven’t actually made any profit. It covers my
3 travel, expenses, and security. No profit.
4 Q When you say covers your "travel" and "expenses",
5 you’re traveling to go to those viewing parties; right?
6 A Yes.
7 It's all part of promotion for the film.
8 Q And you have become a hero at those parties to
9 Trump—haters; right?
10 A I don’t know. I don’t speak for other people.
11 Q Well, haven't you said —— didn’t you say: "People come
12 up and they’re so emotional and put so much on me. They’re
13 like, ’You’re gonna save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a
14 hero;’" right?
15 A You're misconstruing that quote from when I was in a
16 strip club people said that. That’s not from a viewing party.
17 That documentary was actually very polarizing for people.
18 Q So, that is from a strip club that people would come
19 up and say, "You are a hero;" right?
20 A I am quoting a lot of women who came up to me in 2018
21 while I was on stage.
22 Q But, you are continuing to this day to continue making
23 money to sell a story that you promised will put President
24 Trump in jail; right?
25 A No.

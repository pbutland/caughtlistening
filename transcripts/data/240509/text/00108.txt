S. Daniels - Recross/Necheles
2888
1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.  That's not the
2       testimony.
3                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       Q    Well, was that your testimony, that you were -- one of
5   the things that went through your mind about why you couldn't
6   just leave was because Keith Schiller was outside the hotel
7   suite?
8       A    Absolutely.  I would have had to pass by him and get
9   to an elevator and wait for an elevator, and he was a very
10   large man.
11       Q    Well, do you recall being interviewed by Vogue
12   magazine in 2018?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    And do you recall saying to their -- you were asked,
15   did Trump do something that made you feel like you had to have
16   sex with him?
17            And you being emphatic, no.  Nothing.  Not once did I
18   ever feel like I was in any sort of physical danger.  I am sure
19   if I had taken off running, he wouldn't have given chase, and
20   even if I had, there is no way that he could have caught me.
21            Do you recall saying that?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    You didn't mention anything, but, oh, there was a
24   bodyguard outside the door, did you?
25       A    I don't remember if I did or not.  I don't control

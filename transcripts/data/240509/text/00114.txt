1 responsive to.
2 THE COURT: Is there any objection?
3 MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, I don't have a problem
4 eliciting that it is a response to a threat. I think that
5 they are not statements that are made by President Trump.
6 They are statements that are made by some stranger, you
7 know, and she is just ——
8 THE COURT: Does that matter?
9 I don’t think that matters. You did go into
10 these a little bit, and you left the jury with a certain
11 impression. I think it’s only fair that the jury should
12 have the full picture of what we are talking about.
13 I am going to allow it.
14 MS. HOFFINGER: In addition, I am going to seek
15 to show what’s already in evidence, which is People’s 408—8
16 from May of 2024, which we didn’t display that says, if you
17 come after me, I am going after you.
18 Now, with this witness, given the
19 cross—examination that we have heard, I would like to
20 elicit what, if any, affect it has had on her, and what, if
21 anything, being involved in this case and telling her
22 account, what the affect has been on her family, the
23 economical costs and in terms of other costs.
24 And I think the door has not only been open, but
25 the door has been flung wide open at this point.

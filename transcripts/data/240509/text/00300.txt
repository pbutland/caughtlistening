Proceedings
3080
1       any of the other elements of the offense, you said my client
2       denies that there was ever a sexual encounter.
3                Again, as I said before, right off the bat, that
4       puts your client's word against Ms. Daniels' word.
5                And that, in my mind, allows the People to do
6       what they can to rehabilitate her and to corroborate her
7       story.
8                Your motion for a mistrial is denied.  I will see
9       you tomorrow at 9:30.
10                (Whereupon, at this time, the matter was adjourned
11       to Friday, May 10th, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.)

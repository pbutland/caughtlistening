1   Schiller?

3       Q.   Was it your understanding those four individuals had
4   previously worked with Mr. Trump?
5       A.   Yes.
6       Q.   Did you also make an effort to learn Mr. Trump's
7   preferences by observing him while you were sitting in the Outer
8   Oval?
9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   How long did you end up working in the White House?
11       A.   Until August 2019.
12       Q.   Is that a total of two and a half years?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Did you have the same job in the White House the whole
15   time?
16       A.   The same job, yes.  But at some point my title changed
17   to Special Assistant to the President and Director of Oval
18   Office Operations.
19       Q.   Did you sit at the same desk in the Outer Oval the
20   entire two and a half years you were in the White House?
21       A.   I switched desks at some point.  Like I said, there
22   were two desks there.  At some point, I switched to the desk
23   that was further away, but it had a line of sight to the
24   Resolute Desk.  That was more helpful to kind -- for the
25   President and I to communicate.

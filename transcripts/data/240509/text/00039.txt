S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2819
1   there?
2       A    Yes. Someone calling me a "human toilet". So I
3   capitalized on the joke.
4       Q    The other post: "Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels
5   a/k/a the human toilet are their star witnesses."
6       Right?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    You said:  "Exactly. Making me the best person to
9   flush the orange turd down."
10       A    Yes.
11       I don't see "instrumental" or "jail" there.
12       You're putting words in my mouth.
13       Q    So, when you said you were "the best person to flush
14   the orange turd down", you weren't saying you were going to be
15   instrumental in causing him to be convicted of a crime; that
16   was not what you meant?
17       A    No.
18       Q    What does that mean?
19       A    I am pretty sure this is hyperbole. If somebody calls
20   me a "toilet", I say I can "flush" somebody.
21       See how that works? (Gesturing). It goes around.
22       Q    You said you were going to "flush" President Trump?
23       A    I didn't say "President Trump".
24       It says "orange turd".
25       So, if that's what's interpreted by you...

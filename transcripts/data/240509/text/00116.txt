1 Q Defense counsel asked you quite a lot of questions
2 yesterday, and perhaps today as well, questioning whether fear
3 was any part of your motivation in entering into the NDA.
4 Do you remember any of those questions?
5 MS. NECHELES: Objection, your Honor.
6 Those weren’t my questions.
7 THE COURT: Overruled.
8 Q Now, you said in response to questions from defense
9 counsel that you entered into the NDA because of advice from an
10 attorney.
11 Do you remember that?
12 A Yes.
13 Q And that your attorney friend said something to you
14 about hiding in plain view?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Can you explain that a little bit, what that term
17 meant, hiding in plain view?
18 What your understanding is, briefly?
19 A And it was not the attorney who was representing me.
20 This is a friend who was just trying to give me advice. And
21 his friends in the military used the term, get high, stay high.
22 And it just means, if you are out in the open, you are
23 safer; hiding in plain sight, being out in the open. That
24 something won't happen to you if everyone is looking at you.
25 Q Okay.

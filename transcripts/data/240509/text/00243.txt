1       A    I did.
2       Q    Can you, very briefly, describe the circumstances
3   surrounding your departure?
4       A    Yes.
5       In August of 2019, I was invited by a White House colleague
6   of mine to what I understood to be an off-the-record dinner.
7   And at that dinner I said some things that I should not have
8   said.
9       That mistake, eventually -- ultimately, cost me my job.
10       And I am very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.
11       But I feel like I've learned a lot from that experience. I
12   think I've grown a lot since then. (Crying).  Sorry.
13                 (The Court gives the witness tissues.)
14                 (Witness crying.)
15       Q    Do you need a minute?
16       A    No.
17            I'm okay.
18       Q    Did you end up writing a book about your experience?
19       A    I did, yes.
20                 MS. MANGOLD: Can we please show the witness, the
21        parties, and the Court, People's Exhibit 392 for
22        identification?
23                 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the witness'
24        and the parties' screens.)
25       Q    Do you recognize this?

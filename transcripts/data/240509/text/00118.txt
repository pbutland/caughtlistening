1            Do you remember that?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    And those texts were from June 28, 2016.
4            Do you remember that?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And she had you read from some texts --
7                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Let's put up People's 171-A,
8       please, in evidence.
9                 And can you pull up, please, the box where Dylan
10       says, I thought she denounced it previously.
11       Q    Do you see that box?
12                 MS. HOFFINGER:  And then the two boxes below
13       that.  Maybe you can highlight the two boxes below that.
14                 These were from June 28th of 2016.
15                 I am sorry.  Let's do it one box at a time.
16       Q    You see the box, I think it's ending in -- it says,
17   Fox 38904, I have her.
18            Do you see that box?
19            And do you remember she asked you to read the box that
20   says, I have her?
21       A    Yes.
22                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Put up the next box now.
23       Q    And do you remember she asked you to read, is she
24   ready to talk?
25            Do you remember that?

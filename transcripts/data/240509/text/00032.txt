1       A    False.
2       I have no choice how the club advertises, and I never
3   posted this.
4       Q    You did post The Make America Horny Tour?
5       A    I never used that tagline.  I hated it.
6       Q    You continued this strip tour in 2018 and 2019; right?
7       A    Yes. I continued doing my job, dancing at clubs, which
8   I've done through 2001.
9       Q    And you traveled throughout America on this Make
10   America Horny Tour; right?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    And you were selling yourself to people who hated
13   President Trump as someone who get could President Trump
14   indicted; right?
15       A    I was not selling myself to anyone.
16       I was performing at clubs, and whoever wanted to pay
17   admission. It was not geared towards people only allowed in who
18   hated somebody. These were strip club patrons who had seen me
19   dance. They were fans of my work. A lot of the people I knew
20   from ten years before.
21       Q    Am I correct that you said your fan base was
22   completely different, and that the middle-aged white men who
23   used to populate your show and buy your movies were gone, and
24   in their place were now the so-called resistance, women, gay
25   couples, immigrants, and other social liberals who despised

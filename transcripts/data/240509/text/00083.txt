1 a break?
2 THE COURT: I would like to go a little longer.
3 Q You testified on direct that after being in President
4 Trump's hotel suite for several hours, you went to the bathroom;
5 right?
6 A Correct.
7 Q And you claim when you came out of the bathroom he was
8 on the bed in a T—shirt and boxer shorts; right?
9 A Yes.
10 Q Just one minute before we get to that.
11 I want to go back to where President Trump was when you
12 entered the hotel suite room.
13 Do you recall you wrote a book about this; right?
14 A Yes.
15 Q And do you recall that when you say, when you opened
16 the door —— withdrawn.
17 Let's just go back to the room.
18 So you say you came out of the bathroom and he was on the
19 bed in his T—shirt and boxer shorts; right?
20 A Yes.
21 Q And, according to you, when you saw him sitting on the
22 bed, you became faint, the room started to spin and the blood
23 left your hands and feet, yes?
24 A Yes. It was shock. Surprise.
25 Q So just so I can be clear on what you are saying,

1       A    I did not know.
2       Q    Well, that's where the events were taking place in the

5       Q    And they are located one block away from each other;
6   right?
7       A    I don't remember.
8       Q    And so it was your testimony on direct that you walked
9   and then took a car to go one block?
10       A    Uh-huh.  I went to a tattoo studio shop first to see my
11   friends.  And I was wearing heels, and so I took a car the rest
12   of the way.
13       Q    Okay.  And the tattoo studio was two blocks away;

15       A    I don't remember.
16       Q    And isn't it a fact that you -- when you gave an
17   interview to In Touch Magazine in 2011, you said that you
18   remember walking from your hotel to his hotel?
19       A    I don't remember exactly.  Like I said, it was an

21   like an hour.
22       Q    Okay.  I will show you what has been marked as J28.

25   long; right?

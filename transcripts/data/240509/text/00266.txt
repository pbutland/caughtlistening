1       at risk as well.
2                In affirming the D.C. Court's Gag Order in the D.C.
3       criminal case, the D.C. Circuit relied on exactly this
4       point.
5                That Court held, and I quote here:  "Common sense
6       and common human experience teach that hostile messages
7       regarding evidentiary cooperation that publicly relate to
8       high profile witnesses have a significant likelihood of
9       deterring, chilling or altering the involvement of other
10       witnesses in the case itself."
11                "The undertow generated by such statements does not
12       stop with the named individual.  It is also highly likely to
13       influence other witnesses."
14                Here, we have other witnesses.  We have a jury.
15       This is a proceeding that's going on.
16                Some of these Orders have involved proceedings
17       where we weren't even on trial yet.  Here we are on trial.
18                 This Order is not designed just to protect the
19       witness until they are done on the stand and then they walk
20       out the door and they have no protection.
21                And it's not just designed to protect the
22       proceeding part of the way.
23                I also just wanted to point out, we saw a quote
24       from this defendant an hour and a half ago that sort of
25       addressed that exact point.

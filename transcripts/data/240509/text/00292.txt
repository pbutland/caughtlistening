1 value of testimony against the potential for undue
2 prejudice, the Court believes that the testimony from or
3 about Sajudin and McDougal must come with some limitations.
4 Unless the People provide a satisfactory offering of proof,
5 the testimony by or about Sajudin and McDougal will be
6 limited to the fact of, and may not explore the underlying
7 details of, what allegedly transpired between those
8 individuals and the defendant."
9 And we honored that ruling.
10 That limitation did not apply to Stormy Daniels,
11 although the defense asked that it did.
12 I'm only saying this to say that we feel that we
13 have very faithfully adhered to your Honor's rulings and
14 even took additional details out of the questions that we
15 had planned on asking Ms. Daniels as a result of your
16 Honor's —— the conversation that we had at the bench before
17 she began testifying, when the defense renewed their motion.
18 All of this to say, is that the defense has not
19 alleged anything remotely approaching grounds for a
20 mistrial.
21 And their motion should be denied.
22 THE COURT: Thank you.
23 All right. Following the motion ——
24 (Mr. Blanche rises.)
25 THE COURT: What, Mr Blanche?

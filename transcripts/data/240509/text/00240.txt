1       So, behind the Resolute Desk, there was a little credenza;
2   and as time went on, he put pictures of his family behind him.
3       Q    Can you read Ms. Graff's response to you about that in
4   the email chain?
5       A    "Wow. I never saw this one. And in color too. It's not
6   one of the photos I gave to Lara Trump. I'm trying to find out
7   what happened to those. In answer to your question, however, I
8   don't have any empty Tiffany frames. I could go to Tiffany's
9   next door and get one with the account we have with them."
10       Q    Can you read your response?
11       A    "If you don't mind doing that, that would be
12   wonderful. He did mention a Tiffany frame."
13       Q    Can you read Ms. Graff's response?
14       A    It says: "Please note that the frames are on the
15   pricey side. About $650 minus 15 percent discount. Does DJT
16   want to spend that much?"
17       Q    What do you understand "the frames" were "on the
18   pricey side" to mean?
19       A    That they were more expensive.
20       Q    When it says, "Does DJT want to spend that much?", who
21   does "DJT" refer to?
22       A    President Trump.
23       Q    In your experience, is this the type of thing
24   Mr. Trump would want to weigh in on?
25       A    I don't recall any other instances of this.

I Q And so, in 2018, you said that there was nothing that
2 he did that made you feel like you —— that you had to have sex
3 with him, but on Tuesday, on direct exam, you testified that he
4 made nasty comments and stood over you and you felt a power
5 shift; right?
6 A I never said he stood over me. He stood in front of
7 me. I was not below him or on the floor.
8 Q So you were saying, when you testified on Tuesday, that
9 his actions made you feel like you had to have sex with him;
10 right?
11 A My own insecurities made me feel that way. I have
12 maintained that he has not —— he did not put his hands on me.
13 He did not give me any sort of drugs or alcohol, and he did
14 not hold a weapon or hold me at any sort of —— threaten me with
15 any short of an item.
16 And I have said that, and I maintain that. I was not
17 physically threatened or drugged or drunk.
18 Q But these nasty —— supposed nasty comments that he made
19 and standing up over you, those statements were not what you
20 were saying in 2018; right?
21 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
22 THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.
23 A Those statements are exactly what I said.
24 Q You said ——
25 A He said that he thought that I was on the same page

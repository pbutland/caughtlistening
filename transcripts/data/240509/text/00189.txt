1   DIRECT EXAMINATION
2   BY MR. BLANCHE:
3       Q.   Good afternoon.
4       A.   Good afternoon.
5       Q.   My name is Todd Blanche and I represent President
6   Trump.
7            We've never met before; have we?
8       A.   No, we have not.
9       Q.   Just a couple of questions.
10            Now, this book was published in 2007; is that correct?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   You worked for a long time for HarperCollins.  Were you
13   part of the publishing of this particular book?
14       A.   No, I was not.
15       Q.   So you said a little bit about the cover and how
16   HaperCollins will work with the author to come to what the cover
17   should look like and how it should be presented.  At the end of
18   the day, is it fair to say that covers of books, at least in
19   part, are designed and developed for sales to help sell the
20   book; is that fair?
21       A.   They're helped to sell the book, but they're also done
22   very closely with the author.
23       Q.   Understood.  Understood.
24            And just to spend a few minutes on what you were just
25   asked to read.  Every page that you read was partially redacted;

1 A I did not name that tour, and I fought it tooth and
2 nail.
3 Q That was the tour you went on.
4 You spent a couple of years doing that?
5 A It was a job I had already been doing. Most of those
6 clubs I did four or five times before that. Several of those
7 clubs were in place before the book.
8 Q But, it was named The Make America Horny Tour?
9 A That’s what the publicist called it.
10 MS. NECHELES: Can we show J—15?
11 THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Am I talking too fast?
12 THE COURT REPORTER: It would be nice if you
13 slowed down a bit.
14 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness’
15 and the parties' screens.)
16 Q That was for your tour?
17 A Yes.
18 MS. NECHELES: Can we admit it?
19 THE COURT: J—15 is admitted in evidence.
20 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit J—15 is received in
21 evidence.)
22 MS. NECHELES: We can show that.
23 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
24 Q You advertised your tour with a picture of you and
25 President Trump together from the golf tournament?

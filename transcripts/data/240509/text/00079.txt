1       A    I don't know.  I mean, there are photos.  And who
2   knows.
3       Q    And directing your attention to Page 4, the bottom
4   paragraph.
5       A    Uh-huh.  From --
6       Q    Well, I want to direct your attention to the top part
7   of this.
8       Just going back a minute.  Let's see.  1, 2, 3, 4, five
9   lines from the top.
10       Do you recall saying during that interview:  "We ended up
11   having dinner in the room.  I cannot remember what we ordered.
12   I remember what I had the second time I had dinner with him, but
13   I can't remember what we had."
14       Do you recall saying that?
15       A    Hang on.
16               (Pause.)
17       Q    You said that in that interview; didn't you,
18   Ms. Daniels?
19       A    Yeah.  It says, "I don't remember ordering anything or
20   what I ordered, if anything."
21       Q    But you say twice there:  "We had dinner in the room."
22   Right?
23       A    Yes.  Like I said, it was dinnertime in the room.
24       Q    So you are saying that when you said "we had dinner,"
25   you did not mean that; right?

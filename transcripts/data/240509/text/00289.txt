1                I will give you an example.
2                I believe your Honor sustained the objection here,
3       at one point Ms. Daniels was asked, you know:  "Did you feel
4       anything unusual?"
5                Now, the answer to that question was going to be:
6       "I felt what it felt like to feel the skin of a 60-year old
7       man.  I was 27 years old.  And that was a different -- that
8       was different than anything I had ever felt before."
9                Now, that's the kind of detail that would
10       corroborate her account of having a sexual interaction with
11       the defendant, but was not elicited.
12                Your Honor sustained the objection.
13                There are other details that I don't want to put on
14       the record.
15                I'm happy to make an ex parte -- or not an ex
16       parte, a sealed record about some of the very salacious
17       details that were deliberately omitted, notwithstanding the
18       fact that they are highly corroborative because we did not
19       have the desire to embarrass the defendant.
20                So Mr. Blanche, in his application, is conflating
21       the significant level of detail that was elicited about the
22       pre-encounter, the conversation, the relatively harmless
23       conversation that happened in the dining room and living
24       room, but not details about the sexual encounter.
25                And that's what -- the adjustment that we made to

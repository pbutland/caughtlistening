1       misread this?"
2                "How did I misunderstand these clues?"
3                "How did I think this was about a business
4       meeting?"
5                And you can bet that if we didn't draw the sting
6       and elicit the spanking incident, that Ms. Necheles would
7       have cross-examined her:  Oh, really?  You spanked him?  You
8       didn't think that there was anything sexual about that.
9                So we needed to give her a chance to explain that,
10       to prevent them from undermining her credibility.

12       the fact that Mr. Trump did not wear a condom during their
13       sexual encounter.
14                Now, if you remember the testimony, and part of the
15       reason the testimony was elicited about the conversation
16       that preceded the sexual encounter, is that Mr. Trump
17       seemed -- asked a lot of questions about the testing in the
18       adult film industry:  How often the testing happens, whether
19       performers are required to wear condoms, et cetera,
20       questions about that.
21                And the reason -- the reason that that's relevant
22       is because it explains his decision to not wear a condom.
23                 And the fact that testimony about him not wearing a
24       condom comes out is because the description of the
25       conversation that she had with Mr. Trump, again,

1 you've acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies; right?
2 A 150—ish, yes.
3 Q And there are naked men and naked women having sex,
4 including yourself in those movies; right?
5 A Yes.
6 Q And, but according to you, seeing a man sitting on a
7 bed, in a T—shirt and boxer shorts, was so upsetting that you
8 got light headed, blood left your hands and feet, and you almost
9 fainted; right?
10 A Yes. When you are not expecting a man twice your age
11 to be in their underwear —— I have seen my husband naked almost
12 everyday —— if I came out of the bathroom and it was not my
13 husband and it was Mr. Trump on the bed, I would probably have
14 the same reaction.
15 Q And that made you feel like you were going to faint?
16 A Absolutely. If I came out of the bathroom and saw an
17 older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting seeing there,
18 yeah.
19 Q And, according to you, earlier that evening, you had
20 been bossing President Trump around and telling him to change
21 his clothes out of pajamas and to stop talking about himself;
22 right?
23 A That was hours before, yeah, I was in —— I guess it was
24 seeing a man in his underwear that you are not expecting to be
25 there, when you are not expecting him to be there.

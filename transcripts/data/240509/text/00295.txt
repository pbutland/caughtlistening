1 was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there
2 was.
3 Although the People do not have to prove that a
4 sexual encounter actually did occur, they do have the right
5 to rehabilitate Ms. Daniels' credibility and to corroborate
6 her story, which was immediately attacked on opening
7 statements.
8 The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about
9 the encounter, the more the jury can weigh to determine
10 whether the encounter did occur and, if so, whether they
11 choose to credit Ms. Daniels' story.
12 Now, there is more to say about the details.
13 You will recall that I commented on the details on
14 Tuesday.
15 And I will get to that in a minute.
16 1 direct your attention to pages 2508 and 2511 of
17 the transcript, having to do with Ms. Daniels' story, but we
18 continue.
19 Ms. Necheles claimed when you made your motion for
20 a mistrial that she did not object more or earlier or more
21 frequently because she believed that my ruling at the bench
22 had prevented her from doing so.
23 That's not correct.
24 In fact, if you look at the transcript, you will
25 see that Ms. Necheles actually objected very early on.

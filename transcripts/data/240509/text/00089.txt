S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2869
1       Q    You remember what you said to --  withdrawn.
2                THE COURT:  We can only have one person speaking at
3       a time.
4       Q    So what you said to In Touch Magazine was:  "We started
5   kissing."  Right?
6       A    Uh-huh, yes.
7       Q    Nothing about him standing up; right?
8       A    But it also doesn't say that I got on the bed.  This is
9   an abbreviated version.  He stood up.  We started kissing.  It
10   has been edited for clearing.
11       Q    It doesn't say he stood up; did it?
12       A    No, it doesn't say that he stood up either.
13       Q    You said that he said, "Come here;" right?
14       A    He did, he said, "Come here."
15       Q    Meaning you should come to the bed?
16       A    He stood up and said, "Come here."
17       Q    It doesn't say that, does it?
18       A    No, it doesn't.
19       Q    And then you said, "We started kissing."  Right?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Nothing about if you want to get what you want to get,
22   you better go along with this; right?
23       A    They left out a lot of stuff because they couldn't
24   fact-check it.
25       I do remember them telling me that.

1            And so, part of your motivation to enter into the NDA
2   was to make sure this was all documented to keep you safe?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    And you were also happy to take the money, you are not
5   saying that you were not happy to take the money, right?
6       A    No.  We are all happy to take money.  It was just a
7   bonus.
8       Q    Now, there was a question today, Ms. Necheles showed
9   you the NDA, and she walked you through a lot of the legal
10   language in that document.
11            Do you recall that?
12       A    Yes.
13       Q    And that was a document that you hadn't prepared
14   yourself, right?
15       A    No.
16       Q    And some of it is hard for you to understand?
17       A    Yeah.
18       Q    There was no lawsuit pending at the time, right?
19            Did you threaten to sue Mr. Trump or no?
20       A    No.
21       Q    Now, defense counsel on Tuesday, two days ago, asked
22   you to read some texts between yourself -- withdrawn.
23            Asked you to read some texts between Gina Rodriguez
24   and someone whose name was Dylan, who you mentioned you didn't
25   know.

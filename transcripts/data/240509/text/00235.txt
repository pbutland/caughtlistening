1       A    Probably.
2       Q    Did you ever request FedEx labels from The Trump
3   Organization for any other reason?
4       A    Not to my recollection.
5                 MS. MANGOLD:  All right.
6                 Can we please show Ms. Westerhout and the jury
7        what is in evidence as People's Exhibit 76?
8                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
9       Q    Do you recognize this?
10       A    Yes. It's an email from me to Rhona Graff.

12       A    July 18, 2017.
13       Q    What's the subject?

15       Q    And can you read the content to the jury?
16       A    "R. Can you have someone send me a FedEx label to send
17   back the checks the President just signed?"
18       Q    Is this a reference to the personal checks that we
19   were just talking about?
20       A    Probably.
21                 MS. MANGOLD:  And can we take that down?
22       Q    Did Trump Organization employees ever have other
23   questions for Mr. Trump about his personal expenses, unrelated
24   to the checks?
25       A    I -- I don't know the answer to that.

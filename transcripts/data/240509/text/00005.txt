1 MS. NECHELES: If we could pull that up and put
2 that up again.
3 We can turn to Page 2.
4 That can be shown to everybody. That's in
5 evidence.
6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7 MS. NECHELES: If we can blow up the part
8 starting with: "I have her."; "Is she ready to talk?"
9 Blow up the four from the bottom.
10 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
11 Q You see that in this part, you say that Gina Rodriguez
12 was saying —— you know, was asking whether you were ready to
13 talk; right?
14 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
15 THE COURT: Please approach.
16 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
17 at sidebarz)
18 MS. HOFFINGER: Two things.
19 One. This has been fully gone through last time.
20 She can go through it again, but it’s exactly the same.
21 Second. She didn’t say anything. These are not
22 her texts.
23 Ms. Necheles had her read the Gina Rodriguez
24 texts to Dylan Howard.
25 I guess if she wants her to read them again ——

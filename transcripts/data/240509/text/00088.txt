1       Q    Okay.  I'm going to direct your attention to J28,
2   Page 8.
3       A    Uh-huh.
4                   (Displayed only for the aforementioned parties.)
5       Q    And do you recall saying, "I had to use the bathroom.
6   And I went to the restroom, which was in the bedroom.  Like I
7   said, it was a big suite.  I could describe the suite perfectly
8   when I came out.  He was sitting on the bed and he was like,
9   'come here.'  And I was like, 'Oh, here we go.'  And we started
10   kissing."
11       "I actually don't even know why I did it, but I do remember

13   me.  And then I remember thinking, but if I did -- but if he
14   did, I bet -- no, but, I bet if he did, it would be a lot."
15       That's what you said to In Touch Magazine in 2011; right?
16       A    Correct.  Yes, because I wasn't trying to get money,

18       Q    Nothing about him standing up; right?
19       A    No.  I didn't -- I mean, it's not here.  This was an
20   abbreviated article.
21       But he did stand up.  And he was between me and the door,
22   and Keith was outside the door.
23       And then I don't remember -- and then I remember we were
24   kissing and he was on top of me.
25       That's what I remember. I --

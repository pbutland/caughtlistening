1   New Orleans that was haunted and that the spirits that are in
2   the house attacked your boyfriend and held him under water;
3   right?
4       A    Yes, so the house was -- has some very unexplained
5   activity.
6       We brought in experts; people to measure the electromagnetic
7   fields, the religious experts, scientists, people to check for
8   gas leaks.
9       So, yeah, it was a lot of interesting and unexplained
10   activity, so I created a whole entire show.
11       A lot of --
12                MS. NECHELES:  Your Honor --
13       A    A lot of the activity was completely debunked as, you
14   know, a giant opossum that was under the house, for instance.
15                MS. NECHELES:  Your Honor, your Honor, I move to
16       strike all of that now and ask that the witness be
17       instructed to answer the question.
18                THE COURT:  No.  Overruled.
19       Q    And so, my question was that you claimed that you lived
20   in a house in New Orleans that was haunted and that spirits
21   attacked your boyfriend; is that correct?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    And then you say your boyfriend attacked you; right?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    And isn't it a fact that you were the one who attacked

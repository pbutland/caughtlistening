S. Daniels - Cross/Necheles
2823
1        on Tuesday. She's put in half of the Tweet, without
2        putting in what she's responding to.
3                 It's creating an impression with the jury.
4                 We have Ms. Daniels' testimony. She's not sure
5        exactly what she was responding to.
6                 Given this scenario, whether it was an account
7        she was responding to, she has responded to hundreds or
8        thousands of threatening Tweets.
9                 MS. NECHELES:  The other part stands on its own.
10                 If you want, we'll call a witness on our direct
11        case and say this was --
12                 THE COURT:  That wouldn't get it in.
13                 You want to get in a portion of her response,
14        without letting us know what she was responding to?
15                 MS. NECHELES:  I was trying to put the whole
16        thing in.
17                 I have the whole thing there.
18                 THE COURT:  The whole thing is her response and a
19        deleted post.
20                 MS. NECHELES:  But it shows up on the internet
21        from The Wayback Machine.
22                 I can put it in on our case.
23                 THE COURT:  It still won't tell us what the post
24        was.
25                 MS. NECHELES:  It does.

1 negotiating and determining what —— whether to pay for this
2 story. That's not the story that they were told.
3 So, it's not relevant, and it shouldn't have been
4 asked.
5 And I already read that. I'm not going to reread
6 it again.
7 And then, it didn't stop there. Page 2610 of the
8 transcript onto Page 2611, there is a long question about
9 what happened when she exited the bathroom.
10 And this is where, again, she said something not
11 anywhere near the story that was told, supposedly, to
12 Mr. Cohen.
13 She says: "I went to step around. I laughed
14 nervously, tried to make a joke out of it and to step around
15 to leave. Even though I was moving like I was in a
16 funhouse, like slow motion. I thought to myself; great. I
17 put myself in this bad situation. Like, what did I do? How
18 did I misread everything? He stood up between me and the
19 door. Not in a threatening manner. He didn't come at me.
20 He didn't rush at me. He didn't put his hands on me or
21 nothing like that. I said, I got to go. He said, I thought
22 we were getting somewhere. We were talking. I thought you
23 were serious about what you wanted, if you ever want to get
24 out of that trailer park."
25 Now, again, that is a power description.

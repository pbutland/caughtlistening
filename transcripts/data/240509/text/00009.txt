1 Q And Weisberg tried to convince you to let him publish
2 the story; right?
3 A No.
4 Um, let me see, he was my backup in case the Non—Disclosure
5 fell through, not enough time.
6 Q He wanted to publish your story; right?
7 A Everyone wanted to publish the story.
8 Q But, you stopped talking to him when you got the
9 money.
10 You wanted money from him; right?
11 A I stopped talking to numerous people because I signed
12 a Non—Disclosure, and that was part of the deal.
13 Q You could have just let Weisberg publish the story,
14 but you wanted money from Weisberg; right?
15 A I could have had anybody publish the story.
16 Q But, they weren’t willing to give you money; right?
17 A No.
18 Q Am I correct, you told Weisberg you were sharing these
19 details because you were afraid that Michael Cohen was stalling
20 on filing the Non—Disclosure Agreement and, after the election,
21 he wouldn’t pay you; right?
22 A Yes.
23 Q You said that as an alternative to be paid for your
24 silence, you wanted to be paid for your story; right?
25 A I don’t remember.

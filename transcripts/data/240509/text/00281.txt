Proceedings
3061
1                THE COURT:  In fact, after many of these anecdotes,
2       there were objections and they were sustained.
3                MR. BLANCHE:  There was an objection and it was
4       sustained.
5                That doesn't excuse the conduct and doesn't excuse
6       the questions being asked.  Especially with your Honor's
7       ruling, especially knowing full well that the jury hears the
8       question; hear's the answer; and then objection is
9       sustained.
10                I mean, Judge, that's why this type of evidence is
11       so dangerous and so prejudicial and borders on a problem
12       from the beginning, which is why the Court was very careful
13       in allowing it in for a specific purpose and, further, very
14       careful about telling the Government that they're limited in
15       what they can ask.
16                And then the questions about wearing a condom.
17       Judge, now, in that situation, the significance of that is
18       -- and, again, we didn't know this was coming.
19                But, a few minutes earlier, the questions had been
20       elicited about her job and about how and why she went to
21       work for a particular company, the only company in the
22       industry where a condom is mandatory, and so then eliciting
23       that there wasn't a condom -- and, again, that has nothing
24       to do with the false business records, but is so
25       prejudicial.  It's a dog whistle for rape.

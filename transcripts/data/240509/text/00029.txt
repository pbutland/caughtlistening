1       A    I actually didn't. I was completely unprepared for how
2   far that went.
3       Q    Well, after giving the Anderson Cooper interview, you
4   were able to negotiate a book contract; right?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And it was for $800,000 right?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    So, now you were able to sell your story for $800,000;
9   right?
10       A    I sold my life story, yes.
11       Q    And that was in addition to the $130,000 that you had
12   been paid previously; right?
13       A    I didn't receive 130, though.
14       Q    You were paid, but you had to give some of it to Gina
15   Rodriguez and some of it to Keith Davidson; right?
16       A    Okay. Yes.
17       Q    Correct?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    And so, now you had been paid $930,000, almost a
20   million dollars, for selling the story; right?
21       A    I also didn't receive the 800,000.
22       Q    Well, that's what you had contracted to -- agreed to
23   get paid; right?
24       A    Minus commissions and what was stolen from me.
25       Q    Okay.

1                And I went back to just make sure that everyone had
2       followed my guidelines and that there were no
3       inconsistencies, and to just make sure that no one had
4       violated my rulings.
5                After having done so, after reading, again, both
6       sets of motions, both decisions and the motions in limine,
7       the Omnibus Motion and the transcripts, I came away
8       satisfied that -- let me backup.
9                You will recall in my decisions, both in the
10       motions in limine and the omnibus motions, that while I did
11       decide on many of the issues, there were some that I said we

18                Because in going back to the very opening
19       statements, and I'm looking at Pages 897, 905, 906.
20                Mr. Blanche, in your opening statement, you deny
21       that there was ever a sexual encounter between Stormy
22       Daniels and the defendant.
23                And, again, I direct you to Page 897.
24                Your denial puts the jury in a position of having
25       to choose who they believe:  Donald Trump, who denies there

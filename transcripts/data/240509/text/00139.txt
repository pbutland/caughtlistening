6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And you said you thought that that was about you?
8       A    I said I didn't know.  It could be.
9       Q    It doesn't mention your name, right?
10       A    No.

15       Q    Do you know whether this had to do with that
16   Republican PAC?
17       A    Of course not.
18       Q    And you have no knowledge that this had anything to do
19   with you, right?
20       A    No.  And I said as much.

22       Honor.
23                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I just have two questions, your

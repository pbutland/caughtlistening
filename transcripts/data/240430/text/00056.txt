1       Q    So, it's not just a conversation.
2            It is, actually, collecting additional documentation
3   from Mr. Cohen and the agent?
4       A    We would have to ensure that he is not working with a
5   person of interest.
6       Q    And you testified on Friday about -- the prosecutors
7   asked you about what your understanding of a shell corporation
8   is.  Do you remember those questions?
9       A    I do.
10       Q    And I believe you testified that it is an entity
11   that's opened up to receive monies and send out wires and
12   doesn't have an actual business behind it?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    Correct?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    You have no reason to believe, or you didn't at the
17   time, that Mr. Cohen was opening up this LLC to be a shell
18   corporation, did you?
19       A    I don't open up shell corporations.  I open up LLC
20   accounts that have operating businesses.  And if a client had
21   told me that this would be a shell corporation, the account
22   would not have been opened.
23       Q    Why is that?
24       A    Because it's -- shell corporations that have no
25   business behind them would give me pause.

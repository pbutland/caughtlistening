1       Q.   What is a share file account in case people don't
2   know?
3       A.   It's similar -- it's more popularly known as dropbox
4   or Box.com.  It is a secure way to store large or voluminous
5   files.
6       Q.   In what ways was it secured?
7       A.   The share file is encrypted, to my knowledge.  I don't
8   know how they encrypt it, but I do know it's encrypted.
9       Q.   Is it also password protected?
10       A.   It is.

12       A.   Yes, the videos.
13       Q.   Were they transmitted also to TSG after each
14   deposition?
15       A.   Yes, they would have been sent to TSG's share file
16   account as well.
17       Q.   They were saved in that share file?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   And the company took the same steps to make sure the
20   videos were unaltered, including encryption and password
21   protection?
22       A.   That is correct.
23       Q.   Does a witness have an opportunity to comment on any
24   errors they think are in the transcript after it's done?
25       A.   They do.

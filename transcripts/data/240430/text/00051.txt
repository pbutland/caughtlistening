7       Q    And you -- what was your business relationship with
8   Mr. Hutchins?

10   would service my clientele.
11       Q    Was there something unique between your relationship
12   with Mr. Hutchins, or did you have folks like Mr. Hutchins all
13   over?
14       A    I had folks like Mr. Hutchins at all of the offices.
15       Q    Is it because of his location near Trump Tower that
16   Mr. Hutchins was involved in the Michael Cohen relationship?
17       A    Yes.
18       Q    And if we can look at page two of this document,
19   please.  There is a narrative, a business narrative, that's
20   discussed.  If we can just blow that up.
21            And it says, Michael Cohen is opening Essential
22   Consultants as a real estate consulting company to collect fees
23   for investment consulting work he does in real estate deals.
24            Do you see that?
25       A    Yes.

1 I think, continuing this exchange, how did Dylan
2 respond?
3 A. "I bet."
4 Q. And —— withdrawn.
5 Did he then send a follow up?
6 A. He did.
7 Q. And what did he say?
8 A. I am quoting Dylan, he said: "All because Trump is
9 tight."
10 Q. What did you understand that to mean?
11 A. That Mr. Trump was frugal.
12 Q. What relevance did this have to the conversation that
13 you were having with Dylan, Mr. Trump's frugality?
14 A. That they had this deal on a silver platter. It was
15 there for the taking. It didn't close. The only way it doesn't
16 close is because it didn't fund. The only reason it didn't fund
17 is because they didn't want to spend the money.
18 Q. During your dealings with Michael Cohen, did he tell
19 you who he was representing in these negotiations?
20 A. I don't think —— every single time I talked to Michael
21 Cohen, he leaned on his close affiliation with Donald Trump. I
22 don't know if it was ever explicitly said, "I am negotiating
23 this matter on behalf of Donald Trump," it was part of his
24 identity and he let me know it every opportunity he could, that
25 he was working for Donald Trump.

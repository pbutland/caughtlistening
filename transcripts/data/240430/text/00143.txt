1       A    It's a very unfortunate, regrettable text I sent. That
2   phrase is -- is not one that I used or came up with.
3       That -- that term, I think, by one of -- one of Karen's --
4   (witness clears throat) -- associates that was at that first
5   meeting. There was several women who were, um, leaning on Karen
6   to sign the deal with ABC.
7       Q    So, taken as a whole, is this text another effort to
8   spur Dylan Howard into action?
9       A    Yes.
10       Q    Okay.
11       So, turning to Page 5 of the exhibit, and directing your
12   attention to some of the lines between 250 and 273.
13       I'm going to ask you, first, what day is this exchange?
14       A    July 22nd.
15       Q    So, same day as the last text?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    So, how did Dylan Howard answer your text?
18       A    "Yep. I plugged a call in." We [sic] "will have news
19   by Monday."
20       Q    What did you understand that to mean?
21       A    That they would have an offer for Karen on Monday.
22       Q    The following day, July 23rd, do you see another
23   communication from Dylan Howard?
24       A    Yes.
25       Q    What does that text say?

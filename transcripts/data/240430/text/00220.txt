7   basically tells me to call Cohen.
8            Then when I call Cohen, he says:  I'm not paying
9   anything, AMI is paying.

16       A.   Yes.  "Call whenever."

21       A.   This is now the fourth or fifth time I sent my wiring
22   instructions to Michael Cohen.
23       Q.   And in this email, to which domain, email address did
24   you use for Michael Cohen?
25       A.   Gmail.com.

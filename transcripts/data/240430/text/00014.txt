1       A    That's correct.
2       Q    What's the date stamp of this email?
3       A    Oh, the date, excuse me, October 26th, 2016.
4       Q    I'm sorry, the time stamp of the email?
5       A    Okay.  2:35 p.m.
6       Q    So about how long did it take to open the account
7   between the time that Mr. Cohen called you and the time that
8   Mr. Hutchins confirmed that the account was opened?
9       A    Five to six hours or so.
10       Q    Did Mr. Cohen indicate that opening this account was
11   urgent when he called you?
12       A    Yes.  Michael Cohen -- everything was urgent with
13   Michael Cohen.
14       Q    So why did it take five or six hours to open the
15   account?
16       A    Michael Cohen's not our only client, so we do have
17   other things that take precedence.  Moving in and opening an
18   account in a singular day is considered very quick.
19       Q    Is that because there is some processes that the bank
20   needs to undertake in order for the account to be opened?
21       A    Absolutely.
22       Q    And does that require certain checks by the back
23   office, is -- I think you called it?
24       A    Correct.  As well as data entry, getting the paperwork
25   back, et cetera.

1       A    Two.
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Now we can blow it back up.
3                 Thank you.
4       Q    What is the date of these two texts?
5       A    October 10th.
6       Q    Of 2016?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    And what is said during this text exchange?
9       A    This is authored by Dylan:  "Keith, slash, Michael.
10   Connecting you both in regards to that business opportunity.
11   Spoke to the client this AM and they're confirmed to proceed
12   with the opportunity. Thanks. Dylan."
13       Q    What did you understand that to mean?
14       A    Well, prior to this text, like I said, Gina and Dylan
15   had come to terms on an agreement that AMI had agreed to
16   purchase this story for $120,000.
17       Dylan and AMI backed out of that deal. It sort of fell
18   apart.
19       And Gina -- excuse me -- Dylan asked Gina to call Michael
20   Cohen and finish the deal with him. And Gina refused.
21       So, she asked me to call Cohen. And I refused.
22       And then Dylan called me to convince me to call Cohen.
23       Q    So, can we just break that down?
24       A    Sure.
25       Q    Though you didn't use pronouns, so that was helpful.

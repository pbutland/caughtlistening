1 eight, the first page, so we can see it.
2 So, you were shown this document on Friday, and then
3 if we can turn to page eight with the Bates number ending
4 94230. And then if we can just blow up the middle, please.
5 You were asked a question on Friday, and then you were
6 asked a series of questions today about the boxes that were
7 checked on forms like this, both this one, and then also the
8 one that was later completed for the other LLC.
9 And you were asked about question 12, is this entity
10 associated with political fundraising, Political Action
11 Committees, PACs, and the box is checked no, right?
12 Do you remember those questions?
13 A I do.
14 Q So there is a series of other questions that we are
15 looking at on the screen now, all of which say, no, for each of
16 those questions, including the highlighted one.
17 If the answer is, yes, it doesn't mean the LLC won't
18 be opened, does it?
19 A It does not.
20 Q It just means that there is going to be some sort of
21 follow—up question from you or from your Compliance Department
22 or something like that, correct?
23 A That's correct. But I do want to clarify one thing,
24 if I may.
25 Q Yes, please, sir.

1 MR. BOVE: Objection, Judge.
2 THE COURT: Sustained.
3 The objection is sustained.
4 Q. So going back to People's 176A, after that last text,
5 does Dylan Howard send another text?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. What is that text?
8 A. "Push for the cash. D.P. and I told him he has to pay
9 the $150."
10 Q. What did you understand that to mean?
11 A. That in the context of what is on the screen there was
12 an attempt to resurrect this deal that had once fallen apart.
13 That AMI had divested itself from the deal, but they were
14 encouraging Cohen to deal directly with me, and that I should
15 try to get as much as I could, up to $150,000.
16 Q. And who did you understand "D.P." to be a reference to?
17 A. David Pecker.
18 Q. So when you say "resurrect the deal," the deal between
19 whom?
20 A. Well, the Stormy Daniels deal, but the party on the
21 other side of the deal from Stormy had changed. It changed from
22 AMI to Cohen or his corporate entity.
23 Q. So when you said "resurrect the deal," are you speaking
24 that you interpreted this as resurrecting AMI's deal with Stormy
25 Daniels or resurrecting Michael Cohen and his entity's deal with

1       A    It would have because additional questions would have
2   been asked at that time.
3       Q    Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that
4   money was being transferred for the payment to an adult film
5   star?
6       A    It did not.
7       Q    Would the bank's process for approving the wire be
8   different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the wire transfer was
9   a payment to an adult film star?
10       A    Yes, there would definitely be enhanced due diligence
11   on that.
12       Q    By "enhanced due diligence," you mean further checks by
13   the bank?
14       A    Correct.
15       Q    Would that have delayed the transaction?
16       A    It certainly would have.
17       Q    Is it possible that the wire wouldn't have been
18   approved at all by the bank?
19       A    Yes.  If we -- if it was something like that, we might
20   be -- that our reputation is at risk, and we might not have
21   wanted to send the wire.
22                MS. MANGOLD:  I have no further questions.
23                THE COURT:  Thank you.
24                Any cross?
25                MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you, your Honor.

1       week or so of the transaction being finalized.
2                 So those are the ones we could not agree on.
3                 MR. BLANCHE:  We feel very strongly about all
4       three.  I think what we have done to try to appreciate your
5       Honor's ruling, there are two -- and Ms. Rodriguez is not
6       alleged to be an accomplice, and the only reason these are
7       coming in is to provide, as the People just said, context.
8                 And so, with the first one, there is just no --
9       there is just no necessary reason to include that for
10       context.  So, it's not being offered for the truth.
11                 The very small potential, you know, benefit of it
12       providing context, in our view, is greatly outweighed by
13       the potential for the jury to have confusion and take it
14       for the wrong reason, even with a limited instruction.
15       That is the exact same reason for the other one as well.
16                 If you read all the texts and with all the
17       evidence that has been permitted about what's happening in
18       that week, no context is necessary in that situation given
19       the risks that they are going to -- the jury would take,
20       very shady shit is going on, for improper reasons.
21                 Who knows why she said it.  We can all guess and
22       speculate, but that's why it shouldn't come in.
23                 And then the last, your Honor, look, we don't
24       think it should come in at all.  We certainly do not think

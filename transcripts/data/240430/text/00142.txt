1   Howard emailed?
2       A    Perhaps, David Pecker.
3       Q    Okay.
4       So, directing your attention to the last blown-up line on
5   Page 4, is this another exchange between you and Dylan Howard?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And who wrote this?
8       A    This is from Dylan Howard -- no.
9       This is from me.
10       Q    On what day?
11       A    July 22nd.
12       Q    And what's the body of the email or -- sorry -- the
13   body of the text?
14       A    "Don't forget about Cohen. Time is of the essence. The
15   girl is being cornered" -- this is -- "the girl is being
16   cornered by the estrogen mafia."
17       Q    So, who is "Cohen" in this email?
18       A    Michael Cohen.
19       Q    And what did you mean by "time is of the essence"? The
20   same as the "better be quick" email or text from earlier?
21       A    Yeah.
22       I think, at the time, Karen was sort of teetering. She was
23   about to enter into a deal with ABC.
24       Q    And what did you mean by "The girl is being cornered
25   by the estrogen mafia"?

1       Q    Now, if you look above that, there is a portion called
2   "Statement Period."
3       What are the dates of the statement period?
4       A    October 26th, 2016 to October 31st, 2016.
5       Q    Is it typical to have a statement period that's only
6   five days?
7       A    No, it's usually a 30-day statement.
8       Q    Do you know why this is five days?
9       A    Because the cut-off period is -- we would issue a
10   statement regardless of what day you opened it during the month
11   to maintain the schedule of you receiving it the first of every
12   month.
13       Q    So did the account exist before October 26th, 2016?
14       A    No.  That's why it started on October 26th.
15                MS. MANGOLD:  Can we look at the bottom two-thirds
16       of the page, please.
17                (Displayed.)
18       Q    Can you explain what is described under "Account
19   Activity?"
20       A    Yes.  So you will have the deposits and credits and
21   withdrawals and debits.
22       The first being a deposit from the credit on an advance on
23   the home equity line of credit on 6194 for $131,000.
24       And then on the bottom, a domestic wire transfer to Keith M.
25   Davidson and Associates for $130,000.  And then a $35 fee for

1       Q    Can you just explain that a little bit more?
2       A    That, somehow, if Karen did this deal with AMI, that
3   it would help Donald Trump's candidacy.
4       Q    And at the time that you sent that text in jest, did
5   you understand that AMI was working with then-candidate Trump
6   regarding your client?
7       A    I don't know about that. I don't know that I had
8   specific information that they were or not working with him.
9       I knew that they had announced their support for Mr. Trump,
10   but I don't know that they were working with him.
11       Q    Okay.
12       Is it safe to assume from your joke that you had an
13   understanding that if you were to close your deal, this would
14   somehow benefit the candidate, Donald Trump?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    So, I want to turn your attention to Page 6, the next
17   few lines, 292 to 293.
18       I'll ask you, what is the date of these texts?
19       A    July 28th.
20       Q    Yes. I'm sorry. July 28th. That's right.
21       Go ahead.
22       A    This was from Dylan Howard: "She'll get more out of a
23   deal with AMI than ABC. And I'm happy to sign some sort of
24   agreement that alleviates some fears about jurisdiction/meeting
25   only with AMI."

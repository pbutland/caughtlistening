12 different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the account would be
13 used to pay an adult film star?
14 A Absolutely.
15 Q How would it be different?
16 A Well, we would certainly ask additional questions.

18 industry that we do not work with, so there would be a
19 determination made by the second and third line of defense if it

24 opened at all?
25 A Yes, it is.

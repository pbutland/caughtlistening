1   like a story broker.
2       And Dylan, obviously, was a purchaser of stories.
3       So, I interpreted from this text that Dylan had been
4   approached by Gina, who was trying to sell the story regarding
5   Stormy and Donald Trump again.
6       Q    And did you respond in some way?
7       A    I responded: "LOL -- she's trying to sell a story to
8   you?", question mark.
9       Q    "LOL", is that texting lingo for "laugh out loud"?
10       A    It is.
11       Q    How did Dylan respond?
12       A    "Yep."
13       Q    How did you interpret that whole exchange? What did
14   you interpret that to mean?
15       A    As I previously stated, that Gina was trying to -- was
16   bringing this story back to market.
17       Q    And that she had contacted Dylan Howard about it?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    Now, did there come a point in time in which interest
20   in the Stormy Daniels story increased?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    Can you explain that a little bit?
23       A    Um, well, in 2011, we know that The Dirty published
24   their story. And I think I later learned that there was some
25   other interest in 2011 from In Touch Magazine.

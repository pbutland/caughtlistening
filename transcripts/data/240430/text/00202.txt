1   hey, this deal is over.  And I said to both Cohen and to my
2   client, "I'm out.  Go in peace."
3       Q.   During either that conversation, or another
4   conversation with Stormy Daniels and/or Gina Rodriguez, did they
5   express to you any views about what was happening here?
6       A.   I'm not going to answer that question based on
7   attorney/client privilege.
8       Q.   Fair enough.
9            Let me ask you this:  Do you believe that you
10   represented Gina in this matter as well?
11       A.   I don't mean to parse words, but I viewed Gina's role
12   in this situation as that of a manager, which would make her a
13   legal agent to my client Stormy Daniels.  So if I was talking to
14   Gina, it was if I was talking to my client and the privilege
15   would exist.
16       Q.   All right.
17            Did there come a time when you resumed your
18   involvement, notwithstanding this email, in the deal between
19   Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   How did that come about?
22       A.   I don't have a specific recollection.
23       Q.   Do you remember talking with Dylan Howard at any point
24   during this period of where you believed you were getting
25   excuses from Michael Cohen?

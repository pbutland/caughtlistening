1 texts?
2 A I have.
3 Q And are the texts that appear on this exhibit the
4 exact texts you sent and received to and from Dylan Howard?
5 A They are.
6 Q Do you have any reason to doubt the accuracy of the
7 date and timestamps?
8 A I do not.
9 Q Okay.
10 MR. STEINGLASS: I am going to ask that we blow
11 up the last two text boxes —— I mean, the last —— the last
12 column, the first two boxes in the last column. Lines 111
13 through 112.
14 Q Let me ask you, first, can you tell what time zone
15 these —— the date and timestamp is in?
16 A I think it's UTC.
17 Q Are you familiar with the relationship between UTC
18 time and, let's say, West Coast Time or East Coast Time?
19 A Not particularly.
20 Q But these texts are dated particularly in UTC Time; is
21 that right?
22 A Yes.
23 Q What is the date on this first text?
24 A June 7th.
25 Q And who is the first text in this chain from?
Laurie Eisenberg, CSR, RPR
Senior Court Reporter

1   that the deal was closed?
2       A    He was pleased.
3       Q    Now, that deal between AMI and Karen McDougal, did
4   that eventually -- did the contract eventually get signed?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And, generally speaking, what were the terms?
7       A    There was a financial aspect of the deal. I think it
8   was $150,000. It involved certain personal services that Karen
9   would render to AMI, which included, um, magazine covers,
10   weekly or monthly columns where she could write on subject
11   matters that interested her, um, and I believe that was it.
12       Q    As part of that deal, did AMI acquire Karen McDougal's
13   limited life story rights to any romantic, personal and/or
14   physical relationship with any then-married man?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    Just to be clear, who negotiated these terms on behalf
17   of AMI?
18       A    Mainly, Dylan Howard, and then Cameron got involved at
19   some point.
20       Q    And on behalf of Karen McDougal?
21       A    I did.
22       Q    I am now showing you what's in evidence already as
23   People's Exhibit 156.
24                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Can you show them to everyone?

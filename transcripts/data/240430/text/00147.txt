1 And what do the texts say?
2 Start with the first one you sent back.
3 A This is from Dylan: "We are going to lay it on thick
4 for her."
5 Q What did you understand that to mean?
6 A I think at this point in time, Karen was teetering
7 between two competing deals, and we had requested a meeting
8 where —— where each entity could make a pitch as to why they
9 were the correct avenue for Karen.
10 Q Okay.
11 And how did you respond to that?
12 A "Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking
13 the Isle of Mann."
14 Q What did you mean by that, Mr. Davidson?
15 A It was sort of in jest. But, it was —— it was just a
16 joke.
17 Q Um, so, what —— I'm trying to think about how to
18 phrase this question.
19 Why was that a joke? Why was that funny? What was going on
20 in your mind when you made that joke?
21 A Well, I don't think —— I don't think —— I don't even
22 think the Isle of Mann is a country.
23 MR. STEINGLASS: (Laughs).
24 A And I know they don't have an ambassador.
25 But, I think it was a reference to Mr. Trump's candidacy.

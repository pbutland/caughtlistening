1       the Court's decisions on the hearing that we had for
2       contempt, on SMZ-71762 of '24, which covered Counts 1
3       through 3.
4                The Court finds that the People have met their
5       burden of proof and demonstrated contempt as to the second
6       and third incident, but not as to the first.
7                Mr. Trump is fined a thousand dollars on each of
8       those two.
9                As to SMZ-71764 of '24, covering incidents 4
10       through 10, the Court finds the People have met their burden
11       as to all of those.
12                And the Court imposes a punishment of $1,000 on
13       each of those six.
14                I am handing down written decision copies for both
15       sides.
16                The details of the decision are in the written
17       decision.
18                (Handed.)
19                MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you.
20                THE COURT:  Anything else that I need to go over
21       before we get back to the witness?
22                MR. STEINGLASS:  There are a few matters, Judge,
23       but I don't think that they necessarily have to be discussed
24       before the witness.
25                THE COURT:  Okay.

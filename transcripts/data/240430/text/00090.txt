1       A.   Yes, I can.
2       Q.   Does that include Donald Trump?
3       A.   Yes, it does.
4       Q.   As part of its business, does C-Span air political
5   events on TV?
6       A.   Yes, it does.
7       Q.   How does C-Span get the video footage for the events
8   that it airs?
9       A.   In a couple of ways.
10            One, we would send our own cameras to events.
11            Two, we would use what is known as a network pool.
12       Q.   Can you explain to the jury what a network pool is?
13       A.   When there is an event that sponsors want to limit the
14   number of cameras or everyone wants to get the same video, the
15   networks, which are the major broadcasting cable networks, pool
16   together their resources and send one crew.
17       Q.   Does that crew include a camera operator?
18       A.   Yes, it does.
19       Q.   And when there is a camera operator from the network
20   pool assigned to an event, is that camera operator physically at
21   the event?
22       A.   Yes, that is true.
23       Q.   Does the camera operator record the event in realtime
24   as it is occurring?
25       A.   Yes, that's the obligation.

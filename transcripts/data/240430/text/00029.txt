1   you see the amount of the wire transfer here?
2                 (Displayed.)
3       A    $130,000.
4       Q    And can you see the last four digits of the Essential
5   Consultants account where the wire would be coming from?
6       A    1897.
7       Q    And is that the same account that was just opened the
8   prior day?
9       A    Yes, it is.
10       Q    Now, looking at the middle portion of the page.  The
11   font is very small, but can you see what's listed in the
12   beneficiary line of the form?
13       A    Yes, I can.  It's Keith M. Davidson and Associates PLC
14   Attorney Client Trust Account.
15       Q    Do you know what an Attorney Client Trust Account is?
16       A    It's an account that's held by attorneys on behalf of
17   one of their clients.
18       Q    So not going to the attorney directly, it's being held
19   for somebody that they represent?
20       A    That's correct.
21       Q    And if you look at the section called "F.  Purpose of
22   Wire Being Sent," what does it say there?
23       A    It says "Retainer."
24       Q    Why does the bank ask for the purpose of the wire being
25   sent?

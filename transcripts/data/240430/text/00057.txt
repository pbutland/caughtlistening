1            Very frankly, I would want to understand what the
2   purpose of simply opening an account to simply send out wires
3   would be.
4       Q    So, your expectation from your client is that when
5   they open an account, whether it be a LLC or otherwise, it
6   would not be a shell corporation, it would be something in
7   business?
8       A    There would only be one purpose that I would open up
9   an account that had very little activity on it, and that would
10   be LLC ownership of a home or a yacht or aircraft or something
11   along those lines.  And the purpose of that ownership would be
12   to remain anonymous, simply because any type of mortgage on
13   that document or a mortgage taken against that becomes a public
14   record.
15       Q    But an LLC could also be for a business, correct?
16       A    They are commonly used for businesses.
17       Q    So, if Mr. Cohen says he is opening a consulting
18   business or a law firm, that wouldn't raise any red flags to
19   you either?
20       A    Not at all.
21       Q    And, indeed, that's what he said he was doing,
22   correct?
23       A    That's correct.
24       Q    Did you -- so, if we can put up Exhibit 366, which is
25   already in evidence, and I would like to turn to paragraph

9   the witness, the Court and the People and us, D13.
10       A    Okay.

17       Q    -- you opened an account, or you and your team, opened
18   an account for Mr. Cohen and his new law firm?
19       A    Yes.

21   you recall, now that it has been refreshed, having any concerns
22   at any time about this new account being opened by Mr. Cohen?

24       Q    Now, are you familiar with the term PEP?

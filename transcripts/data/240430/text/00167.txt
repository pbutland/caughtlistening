1       Q    When you say "hurt Donald Trump", you mean hurt Donald
2   Trump's campaign?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    Thank you.
5       I want to show you Page 2, Paragraph 7.
6                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
7       Q    Again, I'm not going to ask you to read this whole
8   paragraph out loud.
9       You can just read it to yourself, and when you're done,
10   maybe you can tell us what it means.
11                 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on
12        his screen.)
13       A    This is really an Exclusivity paragraph. It means the
14   rights that Karen was transferring to AMI were Exclusive, and
15   she could not -- she could not -- she retained no intellectual
16   property rights in the story for herself; and that's one.
17       And, two, that she cannot transfer them, subsequently, to
18   anybody else.
19       Q    She no longer owned her own story?
20       A    The limited story.
21       Q    The portion of the story that dealt with her affair
22   with Donald Trump?
23       A    Fair.
24       Q    Is that true?
25       A    True.

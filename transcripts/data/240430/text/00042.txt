1       Q    That's because the reason why you are testifying has to
2   do with your professional job, nothing to do with anything
3   personal; correct?
4       A    That's correct.
5       Q    So just to remind everybody, because we had a long
6   weekend, you were at First Republic Bank from 2008 until March
7   of last year, 2023; correct?
8       A    That's correct.
9       Q    And you were promoted along the way, eventually
10   becoming a Senior Managing Director?
11       A    I was promoted even further than that after that, yes.
12       Q    So what were you promoted to after Senior Managing
13   Director?
14       A    Executive Managing Director.
15       Q    So when you left last year, you were Executive Managing
16   Director?
17       A    That's correct, yes.
18       Q    And when you were assigned the Michael Cohen
19   relationship in 2015, at that point you were a Senior Managing
20   Director already?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And you didn't do account opening for Mr. Cohen, he was
23   already a First Republic client; correct?
24       A    I didn't do account opening for anyone.  I provided
25   advice to clients.

1       Q.   Does the pool camera operator have a business duty to
2   record that event accurately?
3       A.   Yes, because C-Span wants the entire event.
4       Q.   How does C-Span ensure that the video that it is
5   getting is the correct video?
6       A.   Once the event is taking place, there is a producer who
7   watches the video from the beginning to the end and makes sure
8   there are no interruptions in the transmission.
9       Q.   Does a producer watching the video come in whether or
10   not the video is being aired live on C-Span?
11       A.   That is true.
12       Q.   Is the video camera equipment tested before an event?
13       A.   Yes, they make sure there is a valid signal; they would
14   say the signal is good.
15       Q.   That's a signal test?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   Is there also an audio test?
18       A.   Yes, they will make sure there is solid audio coming
19   through the event.
20       Q.   That's for every event?
21       A.   Yes, that's true.
22       Q.   While the video is being transmitted, does C-Span
23   record it to its own servers in any way?
24       A.   Yes, we make copies of the video as it is coming in.
25       Q.   And does C-Span save those videos?

Davidson - Direct/Steinglass
Page 1786
1                 MR. BOVE:  This is what I was concerned about at
2        the end of the last sidebar.  The witness has not indicated
3        that he has a lack of recollection.  To ask a leading
4        question to try to drive him to say, yes, I do have an
5        absence of recollection so it could be refreshed, that is
6        improper.  The answer should stand.
7                 MR. STEINGLASS:  The whole point, how should I
8        find out if he needs his recollection refreshed or ask
9        him?
10                 THE COURT:  He hasn't said he could have his
11        recollection refreshed.  He gave an answer.  That's his
12        answer.
13                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I don't know if this is
14        appropriate, but, you know, the fact that there was a very
15        long pause between the answer that he gave and the question
16        that I asked, that is part of why I am seeing if something
17        could refresh his recollection.  I could acknowledge that
18        he gave the answer.
19                 THE COURT:  You could go back and ask.
20                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I can do that.
21                 THE COURT:  Just in fairness, Mr. Bove, you might
22        have a few times yourself --
23                 MR. BOVE:  In the context where I get to lead the
24        witness.
25                 THE COURT:  That's true.

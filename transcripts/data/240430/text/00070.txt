1       Q    Understood.
2            And the decision that was made to exit from the
3   relationship, with the exception of the mortgage, was done by,
4   is it fair to say, compliance folks at the bank?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And not by you?
7       A    It was not.  The decision was not mine.
8                 MR. BLANCHE:  Thank you.
9                 No more questions.
10                 THE COURT:  Thank you.
11                 MS. MANGOLD:  Nothing further, your Honor.
12                 THE COURT:  Thank you, sir, you can step down.
13                      (Whereupon, the witness was excused.)
14                 THE COURT:  Jurors, let's take our morning

18                 THE COURT:  Thank you.  Please be seated.
19                 People, is there anything you need to go over?
20                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Is this the time that you would
21       like us to take up some of those outstanding issues?
22                 THE COURT:  Sure.
23                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Briefly, the parties did confer.
24       I am handing up to the Court -- do you need another copy of
25       this?

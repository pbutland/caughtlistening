1   paperwork it looks like Mr. Cohen says, retainer?
2       A    It says, retainer.  It is domestic as well so that's
3   what makes it easier to do.
4       Q    The location that the wire is being sent, so in this
5   case, to a law firm, correct, that would also be something that
6   you would look at?
7       A    Yes, I mean, it happens a thousand times a day.
8       Q    And my point is this, my point is, at the time, in
9   October 2016, nothing about the way this account was opened,
10   funded or the wire that was sent out, at the time, raised any
11   red flags to you, correct?
12       A    Not based upon the answers that I was given for the
13   questions I asked.
14       Q    And similarly to your team, if one of them had a red
15   flag from -- if Ms. Rappaport had a concern from her
16   communications with Mr. Cohen, she would have raised that to
17   you?
18       A    That would have been brought to my attention and the
19   process would have been delayed.
20       Q    And that did not happen?
21       A    That did not happen.
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  Can I just have one moment, your
23       Honor?
24                      (Whereupon, defense counsel confer.)

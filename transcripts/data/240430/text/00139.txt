1       Q    You sure about that month?
2       A    July. July 21st.
3       Q    So, it had been some time at this point?
4       A    That's right.
5       Q    What -- who sent what and when?
6       A    This is from Dylan Howard: "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross
7   tomorrow. I think this is the entree for me to go back to
8   them."
9       Q    To reiterate, Mr. Davidson, during this period, the --
10   more than a month had passed since your June 20th meeting with
11   Dylan Howard, and your client, and the others in your offices.
12   Were you in phone communication with Dylan Howard, as well,
13   during this time?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    And so, when -- first of all, I'm going to ask you,
16   what did you understand it to mean when Dylan Howard wrote,
17   "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross tomorrow"?
18       Who's "DT"? What's "DT"?
19       A    My understanding was it was Donald Trump.
20       Q    What's "Ross"?
21       A    "Ross" was a man named Brian Ross. I think he was a
22   broadcaster, a news broadcaster; and I think he was, at the
23   time, heavily investigating for reporting for ABC News.
24       Q    Is it fair to say, during this period of time, you
25   were also negotiating with ABC News on Karen McDougal's behalf?

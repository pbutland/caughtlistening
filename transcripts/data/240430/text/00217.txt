1 Is this still on October 25th?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. What did he say?
4 A. "It's like he is telling me what he wrote to someone
5 else."
6 Q. Maybe if you could read the text first, then I will ask
7 you how you interpret it.
8 A. I wrote: "Keep calling you urgently. Period. We have
9 to coordinate something on the matter he is calling you about,
10 or it could look awful for everyone."
11 Q. You started to tell us what you understood this to
12 mean?
13 A. Yes. I think that this, he is forwarding me a text
14 that he wrote to Michael Cohen.
15 Q. Were you, in fact, trying to reach Michael Cohen
16 yourself at this point?
17 A. I don't believe so.
18 Q. I'm going to privately show you what's been marked for
19 identification as People's Exhibit 337.
20 MR. BOVE: Same objection with the Grand Jury
21 testimony.
22 THE COURT: No speaking objections.
23 MR. STEINGLASS: This is just for the witness, the
24 parties, and the court.
25 Q. Do you recognize this document?

Jury Trial - Colloquy
Page 1656
1       presented on April 15th.
2                 THE COURT:  Could you go over that one more time,
3       the three purposes you want to elicit this?
4                 MR. COLANGELO:  Yes.  First, is to offset the
5       defense claim that the witnesses are benefiting from their
6       willingness to testify.  And by showing, to rebut that
7       claim, that, in fact, their cooperation with law
8       enforcement has harmed them more than it has helped them.
9                 Your Honor will remember that in explaining the
10       allowable use of this evidence for that purpose, my
11       colleague mentioned the People versus Edwards case and
12       handed it up on April 15th to the Court.
13                 The second purpose is to explain why both
14       witnesses initially denied certain facts and have now
15       acknowledged those facts.
16                 And the third purpose is as evidence of the
17       defendant's consciousness of guilt.
18                 And if I can just direct your Honor's attention
19       to the transcript -- to the transcript of the April 15th
20       proceeding, starting at page 56.
21                 Your Honor already observed following the
22       People's proffer of that evidence, quote, you can't dispute
23       that virtually everything that you put up is probative of
24       something to some degree, whether it is consciousness of
25       guilt to explain Mr. Cohen's turnaround to offset

1                 MR. STEINGLASS:  And I believe there are two
2       additional applications that Mr. Colangelo has if you want
3       to entertain them at this time.
4                 THE COURT:  Sure.
5                 MR. COLANGELO:  First, in light of the Court's
6       order this morning, holding the defendant in criminal
7       contempt for nine willful violations of the Court's April
8       1st Order, the People wish to give supplemental Sandoval
9       notice that if the defendant testifies in this trial, the
10       People will seek to cross-examine him on those findings.

14       intends to ask the Court to limit or prohibit
15       cross-examination on any those nine willful violations, the
16       Court can schedule a Sandoval hearing at the Court's
17       convenience and we will be prepared to address the
18       remaining issues.
19                 THE COURT:  Would you like to be heard briefly?
20                 MR. BLANCHE:  I haven't read the Decision yet.
21       We very much want to be heard, not right now.
22                 THE COURT:  Okay.  You have time to read the
23       Decision.
24                 MR. COLANGELO:  Thank you, your Honor.
25                 The second matter relates to one of the Court's

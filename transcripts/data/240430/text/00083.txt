Jury Trial - Colloquy
Page 1659
1       Michael Cohen's guilty plea were not consciousness of guilt
2       of anything happening in this courtroom.  And the risk that
3       the jury will hear that and use it for an improper purpose
4       is huge, right.
5                 Is it frustrating to have your lawyer plead
6       guilty and publicly say he is going to cooperate and
7       testify against you?  Of course.  And similarly, statements
8       along the way encouraging his lawyer not to is not
9       surprising either.
10                 Consciousness of guilt is of a different order.
11                 Consciousness of guilt would be President Trump
12       doing something as it relates to the charges in this case
13       that would show his motivation for doing it was to cover
14       something up that would show that he is guilty.
15                 So, with respect to the other proffered reasons
16       for some of this testimony to counter financial benefits to
17       Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels and to explain why they changed
18       their story, that makes sense.  And I think they are going
19       to talk about that on direct, but consciousness of guilt is
20       of a different order, in our view.
21                 THE COURT:  Do you need a ruling on this?
22                 MR. COLANGELO:  We don't need a ruling today, but
23       understanding your Honor's view by Thursday will help us
24       plan the presentation of the rest of the case.
25                 THE COURT:  Thank you.  See you in a few minutes.

15                THE COURT:  Good morning.
16                We have a couple of housekeeping matters first.
17                I know that both sides wanted to work something out
18       with the sound system.
19                It's my understanding that that is going to be
20       worked out?
21                There is a plan in place?
22                MR. STEINGLASS:  I believe so.  Yes, Judge.
23                MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.  I think we're working it out,
24       and we will try to be as efficient as we can and make it as
25       smooth as possible.

1       Q    And what was your understanding of why Cam wanted you
2   to call Michael Cohen?
3       A    (No response).
4       Q    Withdrawn.
5       Between that last text and this text, did you have a
6   conversation on the phone with Cameron?
7       A    I did.
8       Q    Can you tell us about it?
9       A    Not only -- not only were we not on the same page
10   between the Short-Form and the Long-Form, and then Dylan asked
11   me to call Cameron; and I did call Cameron, and even when we
12   spoke, we still weren't on the same page. I think I told him
13   that. I know I told him that.
14       I said, "Look, this agreement doesn't nearly comport to
15   what was agreed to in the deal points."
16       I think I was frustrated.
17       He was frustrated, and he said, "Why don't you just call
18   Cohen?"
19       Q    "He", meaning Cam suggested you call Cohen?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Did you ask Mr. Stracher why he wanted you to call
22   Michael Cohen if Michael Cohen had nothing to do with the deal?
23       A    I -- I believe so. I probably did. I don't have a
24   specific recollection.
25       I thought it was odd, certainly.

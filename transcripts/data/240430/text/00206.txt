1 A. Yes.
2 Q. What did Dylan Howard say in response, if anything?
3 A. "Did they do the deal?"
4 Q. And what did you understand that to mean?
5 A. I think that Gina and Stormy had another deal, a backup
6 deal in the wings, and he was asking if they closed that
7 secondary deal.
8 Q. "He," being Dylan Howard?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. How did you respond?
11 A. "That's what I hear. I think it will be a full on
12 blitz."
13 Q. What did you mean by that?
14 A. That there would be tremendous media activity around
15 the subject of the story.
16 Q. Now, again, without getting into the substance of
17 privileged conversations, would you say you were talking during
18 this period more with Gina Rodriguez or more with Stormy Daniels
19 or about the same?
20 A. I think overall I was talking to Gina, overall, 85
21 percent of the time. When things got really heated, Stormy
22 participated more, but I think around this time it was probably
23 just Gina.
24 Q. Okay.

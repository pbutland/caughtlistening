1       Q    Okay.
2       So, let me show you some more of these texts, and I'll blow
3   up Page 4, Lines 11116 and 67.
4                 (Whereupon, further exhibits are shown on the
5        screens throughout the following testimony:)
6       Q    I'm going to ask you again to read us these texts and
7   tell us who sent them.
8       A    This is June 27th, from me to Dylan Howard.
9       "It's a story" -- misspelling, but -- "a story that should
10   be told."
11       Q    Just to clarify for the record, the body of the text
12   actually says:  "It's a story hat should be told."
13       You're saying that's a typo, and it should be, "It's a
14   story that should be told"?
15       A    Yes. Correct.
16       Q    How -- withdrawn.
17       What "story" were you referring to?
18       A    The interaction between Ms. McDougal and Mr. Trump.
19       Q    How did Dylan Howard respond?
20       A    "I agree."
21       Q    Now, moving to some later texts on this page, we'll
22   blow them up, Lines 11227 through 31.
23       I'll ask you, first of all, what is the date of this
24   particular exchange?
25       A    June 21st.

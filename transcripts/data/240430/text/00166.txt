1   other services that you mentioned?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    What does this paragraph mean, Paragraph 5?
4       A    It means that it was really AMI's option as to whether
5   or not they ever wanted to run the story of Karen's interaction
6   with any then-married man or not. It was their option to either
7   run it or not.
8       Q    Now, at the time this agreement was executed, did you
9   believe AMI intended to publish the story?
10       A    No.
11       Q    Why did you believe that?
12       A    I believe it was stated.
13       Q    Stated by whom, if you remember?
14       A    AMI.
15       Q    Did you have an understanding as to why AMI would be
16   purchasing a story that they didn't intend to print?
17       A    I think there were two.
18       I think one was -- one explanation that was given was that
19   they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn't want to
20   diminish her reputation.
21       And the second was more of an unspoken understanding that
22   there was a close affiliation between David Pecker and Donald
23   Trump, and that AMI would not run this story or any story
24   related to Karen and Donald Trump as it would tend to hurt
25   Donald Trump.

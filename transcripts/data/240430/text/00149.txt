1       Q    That's a text from Dylan. That means Dylan Howard;
2   correct?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    What did you understand that to mean?
5       A    I -- I understand the first part, the first sentence.
6       I'm not so sure I understand the second sentence.
7       Q    Okay.
8       Well, tell us about the part you do understand.
9       A    "She'll get more out of a deal with AMI than ABC," I
10   think that's self-explanatory.
11       And Dylan was making his case why they were the right
12   avenue for Karen to choose.
13       Q    Okay.
14       How did you respond?
15       A    "I need this to happen."
16       Q    Now, Mr. Davidson, based on non-privileged
17   communications to which you were privy, why did you need this
18   to happen?
19       Why did Karen McDougal prefer the AMI deal to the ABC deal?
20       A    Because she -- at that time -- at that time, based on
21   non-privileged information, she had announced her desire to not
22   tell the story about her interaction with Donald Trump.
23       Q    So that -- withdrawn.
24       Part of the allure of the AMI deal was that she wouldn't
25   have to; is that your understanding?

G. Farro - Cross/Blanche
Page 1619
1       I don't do the actual, physical paperwork.
2       Q    But whenever Mr. Cohen was onboarded at First Republic,
3   you were not part of that process?
4       A    Not part of the paperwork process.  I would have
5   conversations about the types of accounts and provide advice,
6   but not necessarily on the account opening paperwork.
7       Q    Do you know how long Mr. Cohen had been a First
8   Republic client before you took over the relationship with him?
9       A    I recall 2012 being a possibility of when he
10   established a relationship initially, but I could be wrong.
11                MR. BLANCHE:  Can we put up what has already been
12       admitted in evidence as People's Exhibit 368, so everybody
13       can take a look at that.
14                (Displayed.)
15       Q    If you -- this is one of the documents that you looked
16   at last week.
17       If we look at, towards the bottom of this document, there is
18   a series of questions at the bottom right.
19       If you see, it says, "Referral source's length of
20   relationship with the bank."
21       And it says, "five years?"
22       And then if we could look at the top of that same document,
23   I believe this document was updated in October of 2016.
24       Do you see that?
25       A    Yes, so that would be 2011.

1       Q    Who was asking you to go back for another $25,000?
2       A    It would be Mr. Grdina and Karen McDougal.
3       Q    And how did Dylan Howard respond?
4       A    "He just called me. 'F' it. Not my money. I'll ask."
5       Q    When you said, "F it," is the full "F" word written
6   out in the text?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    What did you understand that to mean?
9       A    Um, that someone just called him, and that he didn't
10   care about money because it wasn't his; he would run it up the
11   flagpole.
12       Q    "He didn't care about money; he would run it up the
13   flagpole;" you're referring to Dylan Howard?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Okay.
16       The next text please, who is that from?
17       A    From me, to Dylan: "Let's try and wrap up Karen's
18   deal. She is getting repeated phone calls from Rhonda
19   Schwartz."
20       Q    What did you mean by that?
21       A    That the deal was getting stale. It had been left on
22   the counter for a bit. And if he wanted to close it up, now was
23   the time.
24       Q    Who is Rhonda Schwartz?
25       A    Rhonda was with the Investigation Department at ABC

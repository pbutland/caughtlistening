1       Q    All right.  2011.
2       And, by the way, you have no reason to believe that there is
3   anything inaccurate about that, it's about five years?
4       A    No.
5       Q    And so, again, you testified on Friday that when you
6   were given the Mr. Cohen assignment, you were told that
7   Mr. Cohen could be -- was difficult; is that fair?
8       A    Yes.  He was a challenging client because of his desire
9   to get things done so quickly.
10       Q    Do you remember the first time you spoke with
11   Mr. Cohen?
12       A    I do.
13       Q    Can you tell us about that?
14       A    Yes.  I -- excuse me, pardon me for a second.
15       (Pause.)
16       I was brought to Michael Cohen's office with my boss at the
17   time for an introduction.
18       Q    And that's the office at the Trump Tower?
19       A    That's correct.
20       Q    So the initial communication with him was in person,
21   but I believe over the course of the relationship, did you
22   mostly talk on the phone with him?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Or meet him in person?
25       A    It was mostly over the phone.

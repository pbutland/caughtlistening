1            Do you understand what I mean by that?
2       A.   I do.  It was KMDlaw.com.
3       Q.   So you had an email address, some form of your name, at
4   KMDlaw.com?
5       A.   Yes.
6       Q.   And what does KMD Law stand for?
7       A.   It's my initials, Keith Michael Davidson.
8       Q.   Are you here pursuant to a subpoena?
9       A.   I am.
10       Q.   Did you testify in this case in the Grand Jury?
11       A.   I did.
12       Q.   As a result of that testimony, were you given automatic
13   immunity for the transactions about which you gave testimony?
14       A.   Pursuant to New York Law.  I didn't seek immunity.
15       Q.   That was my next question.  So, yes, you did get
16   immunity; but no, you did not seek it?
17       A.   Correct.
18       Q.   And is it your understanding, I think you just said
19   this, that immunity is granted as a matter of law in the State
20   of New York for witnesses who testified in the Grand Jury?
21       A.   True.
22       Q.   Notwithstanding the fact that you were given immunity
23   for your testimony, you did understand if you testified falsely
24   then or if you testify falsely now you could still be prosecuted
25   for perjury; is that correct?

1   of this meeting between your client and Dylan Howard?
2       A    It was sort of a proffer session where -- where
3   Ms. McDougal would -- under agreement that nothing was to be
4   published, where Ms. McDougal would tell her story to Dylan
5   Howard on behalf of AMI, so that Dylan could gauge interest in
6   the story, whether or not AMI did or did not have interest in
7   this story.
8       Q    Now, did the meeting result in an immediate deal with
9   AMI?
10       A    No, it did not.
11       Q    How did you leave it with Dylan Howard?
12       A    Um, Dylan wanted to -- to return to New York, um, run
13   it up the flagpole, and stated that he would get back to me.
14       Q    When you say "run it up the flagpole", who, to your
15   knowledge, was higher at AMI, higher than Dylan Howard?
16       A    It's my understanding that the only one higher than
17   Dylan Howard at AMI was David Pecker.
18       Q    So, very generally speaking, in the weeks that
19   followed, what happened after that?
20       A    I think Dylan -- the first entree, if you will, was
21   that Dylan stated that AMI was not interested at that time
22   because Karen lacked -- excuse me -- Karen, Karen McDougal
23   lacked documentary evidence of the interaction.
24       Q    So, how did you leave it?
25       A    Um, I think we just said we would keep in touch.

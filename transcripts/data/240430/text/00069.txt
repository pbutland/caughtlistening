1   to close the accounts that could be closed with Mr. Cohen?
2       A    I don't make those decisions.
3       Q    No, you were not part of those decisions?
4       A    No.
5       Q    You were informed that the decision was made?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And you -- do you have any reason to believe that when
8   that decision was made, it had anything to do with anything
9   other than the public pressure reports about what you just
10   testified?
11       A    That was my understanding.
12       Q    And, if true -- and, by the way, you have no personal
13   knowledge of whether it is true or not, do you?
14       A    No.
15       Q    If true, that would have meant, potentially, that
16   there wasn't appropriate due diligence done by the bank at the
17   time, right?
18                 MS. MANGOLD:  Objection.
19                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       A    I don't know if that's a fair statement.
21       Q    Well --
22       A    Due diligence is done prior to an account being
23   opened.  After a transaction happens, it goes from one lawyer
24   to another lawyer.  I can't be expected to know where it is
25   going to end up after that.

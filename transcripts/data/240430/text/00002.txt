1                THE COURT:  The second issue.
2                At the start of the trial, Mr. Blanche, you had
3       requested two days for high school graduations, one for
4       Mr. Trump and one for a colleague.
5                Can you tell me what those days were?
6                MR. BLANCHE:  Yes, your Honor.
7                (Counsel confer.)
8                MR. BLANCHE:  May 17th and June 3rd.
9                THE COURT:  All right.  We got through the jury
10       selection really quickly, I think we are ahead of schedule
11       and I think we have been moving well ahead since, so I don't
12       think that the May 17th date is a problem.
13                So Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date --
14       attend his son's graduation.
15                June 3rd, it's really up to you.  I think, at that
16       point, the jury might be deliberating.  It could be a
17       challenge.
18                MS. NECHELES:  I understand, your Honor.  And, of
19       course, if they are deliberating --
20                THE COURT:  And if they are not deliberating, I
21       think that that will be fine as well.
22                MS. NECHELES:  Thank you.
23                THE COURT:  I believe the clerk of the court called
24       the SMZs into the record.
25                Let the record reflect that I'm about to hand down

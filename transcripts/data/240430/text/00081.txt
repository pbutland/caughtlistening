1       allegations that the witness is somehow benefiting from
2       this.
3                 So, your Honor recognized those purposes that the
4       People should not elicit anything until the defense opened
5       the door, and our point now is that it is clear that the
6       opening statements opened the door wide.
7                 THE COURT:  Can you go ahead and articulate what
8       the consciousness of guilt would be?
9                 What was it about these actions that goes to
10       consciousness of guilt?
11                 MR. COLANGELO:  Sure.
12                 So, your Honor, public statements, and the public
13       statements, in particular, that we are thinking of are
14       comments regarding Michael Cohen during early 2018,
15       immediately after the FBI raid and seizure of his devices,
16       and the raid of his homes, saying things like, some people
17       may flip if they are put under pressure, but Michael Cohen
18       is not that kind of person.
19                 Followed immediately after, he plead guilty in
20       August of 2018, by other public statements that changed his
21       tune entirely.  Then he said things like, if anybody is
22       looking for a good lawyer, Michael Cohen is not your
23       person.  I am paraphrasing.
24                 But it's in the tweets referring to Paul
25       Manafort, and saying, Paul Manafort will never crack,

1 way around?
2 A It's from Dylan Howard to me.
3 Q And, so, when Dylan Howard said, "I need this to
4 happen," how did you interpret that?
5 A I don't know. I suppose I interpreted it that he

7 Q You mean, "it" being the deal with Karen McDougal and
8 AMI?
9 A Yes, sir.
10 Q Okay.
11 Continuing on with this exhibit to the next page, Page 7,
12 I'm going to blow up Lines 314 to 319.
13 Again, I'll ask you to give us the date, the to and the
14 from, and the substance of these emails —— texts.
15 A You want me to read right through all of them?
16 Q Sure.
17 Start with the date and time of the first one, please.
18 A This is August 2nd, from me to Dylan Howard: "I can't
19 believe they are asking me to go back to you for another 25 but
20 they are. He deal is accepted at 150. Can you do that?"
21 Q A couple of questions about that.
22 First of all, does "25" mean "25,000"?
23 A Yes.
24 Q And "he deal", should that read "the deal"?
25 A Yes.

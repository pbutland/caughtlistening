1       A    "Cameron's agreement wasn't really even close to what
2   we were expecting. Please review the red-line I just sent. Need
3   to handle this quickly."
4       Q    First of all, who is "Cameron"?
5       A    Cameron Stracher is General Counsel for AMI.
6       Q    What is a "red-line"?
7       A    A "red-line" is just modifications or corrections to
8   an editable document that's like -- it's a step along the way
9   in modifying a document.
10       Q    So, what did you mean when you said that his agreement
11   wasn't close to what you were expecting?
12       A    We had come to terms by this point with AMI on the
13   deal points. And there was a Short-Form Agreement or at least
14   deal points. And that that was negotiated between Dylan and I.
15   And then Dylan, as a content editor, handed it off to the Legal
16   Department at AMI, Cameron. And when the Short-Form Agreement
17   or the deal points morphed into the Long-Form Agreement with
18   Cameron, they didn't jive.
19       Q    So, do I understand you correctly to be saying that
20   Cameron had sent you a contract, and it did not match your
21   understanding of what you thought the deal was that had been
22   negotiated between yourself and Mr. Howard?
23       A    Correct.
24       Q    So, when you refer to "the red-line", does that mean
25   you made proposed changes to the contract they had sent over

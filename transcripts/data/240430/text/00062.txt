1       Q    Yes.  Can you tell the jury -- are you familiar with
2   that term?
3       A    I am.
4       Q    Can you tell the jury what a Politically Exposed
5   Person, a PEP, is?
6       A    It's someone who has either held office, is in office
7   or is related to, or very close to, someone in office.
8       Q    When you say, in office, are there different types of
9   PEPs, international and domestic?
10       A    Yes, there is.
11       Q    So, when you were just talking about someone who held
12   office, do you mean a domestic PEP is someone elected to serve
13   as a Congressman, Senator, State Senator, President of the
14   United States, that sort of thing?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    Now, as -- if Mr. Cohen is a personal attorney to
17   President Donald Trump in 2017, in your view, would that make
18   him a PEP?
19       A    As the attorney for him, I would not consider that a
20   PEP.
21       Q    So, are you aware that the definition of a PEP,
22   domestic PEP, includes any close associates or any individual
23   publicly known or known by the financial institution to be a
24   close, personal, professional associate?
25       A    I was not aware of that.

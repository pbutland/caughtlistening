Jury Trial - Colloquy

1       Mr. Cohen was previously loyal and defended the defendant
2       on television, publicly and privately.  And then, after
3       getting caught in 2018, Mr. Cohen made the decision to
4       blame the defendant for his problems, and he is an admitted
5       liar, and that's at pages 899 to 900.
6                 Defense counsel also said the evidence would show
7       that Mr. Cohen's expected testimony can't be believed
8       because his goal is to go on television and social media
9       and his entire financial livelihood depends on attacking
10       the defendant.
11                 The defense made a similar or same assertions as
12       to Stormy Daniels, another expected witness, stating that
13       the evidence would show that she previously denied an
14       improper relationship in writing, and that she was now
15       making a living off of the defendant by talking about her
16       interactions with him, including through a book and a
17       documentary.
18                 All of those assertions that defense counsel made
19       in the opening statement about what the evidence would show
20       regarding the credibility of those witnesses are precisely
21       the kinds of arguments or assertions that your Honor
22       predicted the defense would make and stated, would open the
23       door to the People being allowed to elicit evidence
24       regarding the defendant's efforts to keep them in the fold,
25       keep Mr. Cohen in the fold originally, followed by

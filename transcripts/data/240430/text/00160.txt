2 Q And then, did he say anything else?

8 involved, and it was —— it was just a lot of, sort of, heavy
9 lifting.
10 Q And then what did you say?
11 A "Yes —— I believe so. I told Cohen this never would
12 have happened without you.”
13 Q How did Dylan Howard respond to that?
14 A "He's hopeless. Oh well. Another one done."
15 Q So, from this text exchange, does it appear —— let me
16 ask this a different way.
17 Did you call Cohen at some point in the middle of this text
18 exchange?
19 A I recall that I did, yes.
20 Q And did you discuss the Karen McDougal contract with

22 A Yes.
23 Q And I'll come back to exactly how that conversation
24 went in a minute.
25 I want to take a minute to show you Grand Jury —— I'm sorry

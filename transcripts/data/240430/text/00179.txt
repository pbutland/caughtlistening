1   hot mic recorded some statements by both men, um, that were
2   troublesome.
3       Q    What impact, if any, did the release of the Access
4   Hollywood tape have on interest in Stormy Daniels' story, so
5   far as you were aware?
6       A    So far as I'm aware, it had tremendous influence.
7       Q    Can you explain that a little bit to the jury, please?
8       A    Before -- yes.
9       Before Access Hollywood tape, there was very little, if any
10   interest, from what I understand, and Gina was trying to sell
11   the Stormy Daniels/Donald Trump story.
12       It wasn't until Access Hollywood that interest sort of
13   reached a crescendo.
14       Q    So, going back to People's 176A in evidence,
15   specifically on Page 1761, Lines 482 to 494. Is this another
16   text exchange between you and Dylan Howard on October 8th and
17   October 9th of 2016?
18                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Who sent the first text in this chain?
21       A    It's from me.
22       Q    And what did you say?
23       A    "Trump is F'd."
24       Q    You wrote the whole word out, "F'd", in the text?
25       A    I did.

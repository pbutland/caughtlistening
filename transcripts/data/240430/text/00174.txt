1 A Yes.
2 Michael Cohen —— the blog post had published. And,
3 apparently —— or, I was informed that Gina had received a phone
4 call from Michael Cohen. And the phone call that she received
5 from Michael Cohen, I think it was a voicemail. I know it was a
6 voicemail. And it might have either been a voicemail or a phone
7 call that was answered by Gina's ex—husband.
8 In any event, Gina called me up to tell me that: "Some jerk
9 called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue
10 me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back."
11 Q I hate to ask it this way, but who was that "jerk"?
12 A It was Michael Cohen.
13 Q So, what happened when you called —— did you call
14 Michael Cohen?
15 A I did.
16 Q Tell us about that.
17 A Gina provided me the number that he left, either with
18 her ex or on the voicemail. It was for The Trump Organization.
19 I called. I was transferred to Michael Cohen.
20 I introduced myself. And before I could barely get my name
21 out, I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and
22 insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.
23 Q What was the gist of what he was accusing you of?
24 A (Pause) I don't think he was accusing us of anything.
25 He was just screaming.

3   CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION
4   BY MR. STEINGLASS:
5       Q.   And is what was the purpose of using a side letter
6   agreement with this particular deal?
7       A.   The Side Letter Agreement -- the purpose for using a
8   Side Letter Agreement, it uses like code words that are used in
9   a military-like operation, so it ensures the further
10   confidentiality in case a fully executed contract was lost or
11   stolen.  So even if that occurred, you wouldn't lose the
12   confidential nature of the document.
13            So the Side Letter Agreement is typically used in these
14   cases to identify the identity of the true parties involved.
15   And it's really for attorneys' eyes only.
16       Q.   Okay.
17            So, just to be clear, who were the two parties to this
18   agreement, whose names, whose identities were being protected?
19       A.   Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump.
20       Q.   One of the attachments also to this email -- withdrawn.
21            What did you say in the body of the email in which you
22   transmitted these documents?
23            Let's start with Paragraph 1.
24       A.   Paragraph 1?
25       Q.   Yes.

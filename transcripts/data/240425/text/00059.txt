1       Q    Okay.  So I am going to blow up the top of this
2   invoice, and I am going to ask you a few questions about it.
3            First, of all what is the date of this invoice?
4       A    9/21/16.
5       Q    Who is being billed?
6       A    Resolution Consultants LLC.
7       Q    And I think you alluded to this a few minutes ago, but
8   what was your understanding of the purpose of using Resolution
9   Consultants to reimburse AMI for the Karen McDougal payment?
10       A    When I spoke to Michael Cohen, he said he was creating
11   a company to receive the lifetime rights and that would
12   reimburse -- it would reimburse and pay the $125,000.
13       Q    So you were using Investor Advisory Services and
14   Michael Cohen was using Resolution Consultants?
15       A    That's correct.
16       Q    What is the description of services provided in this
17   invoice?
18       A    It says, agreed upon flat fee for advisory services.
19       Q    Was this invoice actually for advisory services?
20       A    No, it wasn't.
21       Q    What was it really for?
22       A    This was for the lifetime writes of the Karen McDougal
23   story.
24       Q    Why did the invoice from Investor Advisory Services
25   say, agreed upon flat fee for advisory services?

1        objection, please?
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.
3                 My objection is an objection under People v.
4        Bornholdt.
5                 I think Mr. Bove, arguably, laid a foundation to
6        ask about People's A101, which at least contains some
7        reference, a paragraph that references the August 2015
8        Trump Tower meeting.
9                 However, he then showed the witness People's
10        Exhibit A102, which, insofar as I can tell, doesn't have
11        anything at all about the August 2015 meeting.
12                 He asked a question:  Did you ever say anything
13        about the presence of Hope Hicks at this meeting?
14                 The witness says:  I don't know. I need to see
15        the document. I need to look through it.
16                 He wasn't given that opportunity.
17                 I objected because I thought that question was
18        improper, because I thought it violated Bornholdt.
19                 There was no indication the witness was asked
20        about the August 15th meeting during the interview, and
21        there was no indication that admitting it would be an
22        unnatural omission under People v. Bornholdt.
23                 The witness asked to be shown the document so he
24        could look and it and be shown if there was a discussion
25        in the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower.

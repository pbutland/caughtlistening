1       Q    Good afternoon, Mr. Pecker.
2       A    Good afternoon.
3       Q    When we broke before lunch, we just finished talking
4   about a meeting you had in Trump Tower on January 6, 2017; do
5   you remember that?
6       A    Yes, I do.
7       Q    Directing your attention to July of that same year,
8   2017, did there come a time when you visited the White House?
9       A    Yes, I did.
10       Q    How did that come about?
11       A    I received a call from President -- President Trump's
12   office from his assistant, Madeleine -- I think it was
13   Whitehout (phonetic) [sic]. I can't remember her last name.
14       And she said, "The President is on the phone."
15       Mr. Trump called and invited me to the White House for
16   dinner.
17       Q    Did he say why?
18       A    He said it was a thank you dinner, and he invited
19   myself and my wife.
20       Q    And what did you say?
21       A    I said that, "I'll speak to my wife and I'll get right
22   back to you."
23       Q    And did you do that?
24       A    I did.
25       And my wife didn't want to go to Washington.

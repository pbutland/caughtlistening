1 McDougal.
2 We'll get to the Stormy Daniels' interview later.
3 A Oh.
4 Q So, my question is, did Mr. Trump call you in
5 connection with Karen McDougal's appearance?
6 A Yes, he did.
7 Q Now, please, tell us what he told you about that.
8 A So, Mr. Trump said when he called me that, he said,
9 "Did you see the Anderson Cooper interview with Karen
10 McDougal?"
11 I said, "Yes."
12 He said, "I thought you had and we had an agreement with
13 Karen McDougal that she can't give any interviews or —— or be
14 on any television shows."
15 So, I said, "Yes." I said, "We have an agreement, but I
16 amended it to allow her to speak to the press."
17 So, Mr. Trump got very aggravated when he heard that I
18 amended it, and he couldn't understand why.
19 I said, "Karen has a two—year agreement. She was flooded
20 with requests from the press for interviews. And I amended her
21 agreement at that time."
22 He said, "Well, then you paid her?"
23 I said, "Yes, I paid her, and I amended the agreement."
24 So, he with was very upset. He couldn't understand why I
25 did it.

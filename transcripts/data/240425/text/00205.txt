1                THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       A    I -- I don't recall anyone telling me about that, that
3   Mr. Trump was away in the first week of August.
4       Q    So in the Grand Jury you were under oath; right?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    And there was a court reporter, like the one who is
7   sitting in front of you now; right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    And you understood that it was what you said was being
10   taken down; right?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Important to tell the truth, obviously?
13       A    Yes.
14       Q    And you wanted to; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And, in 2023, you said that your best memory was that
17   this meeting took place in the first week of August; right?
18        Correct?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And then you changed your testimony, this week, on that
21   issue; right?
22       A    Yes, that's correct.
23       Q    And you are saying that you are not aware that
24   President Trump was not in New York City during the first week
25   of August 2015?

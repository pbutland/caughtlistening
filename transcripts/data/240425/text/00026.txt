2       Q    What did you understand Dylan Howard to be referring to
3   when he said "that other issue?"
4       A    I don't recollect.  Can we -- can you clarify that?
5       Q    Well, I can't testify.
6       A    No, no.
7       Q    But why don't we move on and see if the context will
8   help you answer this question.
9       A    Okay.
10       Q    And just while we're here, we have this displayed, what
11   was your response to Dylan Howard on July 23rd?
12       A    I said:  "Good move and follow up."
13       Q    And as you sit here, Mr. Pecker, do you recall whether
14   a contract was signed at some point with Karen McDougal?
15       A    Yes.  It would have been signed the first week of
16   August of 2016.
17       Q    Okay.  So did you have any concerns about the legality
18   of AMI paying to kill a story regarding a political candidate?
19       A    Yes, I did.
20       Q    Why did you have those concerns?
21       A    In 20 -- between 2002 and 2003, I had an issue when I
22   acquired a story for Arnold Schwarzenegger, when he was running
23   for Governor of California.
24       Q    Can you explain a little bit more about that to the
25   jury, please?

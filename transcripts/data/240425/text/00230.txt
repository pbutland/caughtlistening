1                 THE COURT:  Well, you gave him A102, which gives
2        the impression that there's something in this document
3        that will refresh his recollection.
4                 MR. BOVE:  What I perceive refreshed his
5        recollection was he did not recollect this meeting with

18                 I'm going to ask you to please be very careful
19        with that.
20                 I'm not accusing you of having done it
21        deliberately.
22                 But, it still left the jury with the
23        misimpression that he had omitted something.
24                 If you want to hand him something to refresh his
25        recollection, you should actually hand him something that

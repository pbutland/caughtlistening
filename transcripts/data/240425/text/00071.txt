1       would be a co-conspirator and that statement is attributed
2       to him.
3                 Going down to the bottom portion, what Mr. Bove
4       is asking is if you can redact it.
5                 How difficult would it be to redact some portions
6       of it?
7                 MR. STEINGLASS:  It is not a question of
8       difficulty of redacting it.  It is a question of the fact
9       that the rest of the email chain doesn't make any sense and
10       it is not clear that they are talking about the Dino
11       Sajudin story.
12                 So, I think that -- I think that -- it really is
13       admissible to contextualize the remainder of the email
14       chain and the prejudice argument is not an argument to make
15       when nobody is claiming that there is any truth to these
16       allegations, and I believe the witness testified that it
17       was 1,000 percent untrue.
18                 THE COURT:  I agree.  What would you like me to
19       do, a limiting instruction on this?
20                 It's been testified about.
21                 MR. BOVE:  It has, Judge.  There are details in
22       here about the underlying -- not just what came from Mr.
23       Sajudin, but the following investigation, the woman who was
24       allegedly involved in this, her name, there is a lot of
25       information in here.

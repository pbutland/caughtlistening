1       A    Yes.  In 2002, the Weider Magazines, which was Shape,
2   Muscle and Fitness, Flex, Health and Fitness titles, were up for
3   sale.
4       Joe Weider was the founder.
5       He developed -- he founded all of those magazines.
6       He also found -- he also discovered Arnold Schwarzenegger,
7   and those guys.
8       I should say that Joe Weider and Arnold Schwarzenegger had a
9   relationship for 50 years.
10       So when the magazines were being sold, and I went to see
11   Joe Weider right before the sale, he said to me:  "Before we
12   finalize this transaction, you have to meet with Arnold
13   Schwarzenegger."
14       So I -- he gave me his phone number.
15       I called up Schwarzenegger.
16       I went to see him, and he had the following conversation
17   with me:
18       He said that, you know, "I have been on the covers of Muscle
19   Fitness and Flex, two of the primary magazines you are buying,
20   70 to 80 times."
21       He said:  "I want to be an Editor-at-Large for both
22   magazines."
23       And I would like a -- "I want an agreement."
24       And he said:  "I'm" --
25       And he said:  "You bought the tabloids."

1       Q    Now, do you understand that to mean July 23rd, 2016,
2   at 7:21 p.m. UTC time?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    Do you know what UTC time is?
5       A    UTC time is four to five hours ahead of Eastern
6   Standard Time, depending on what season it is.
7       Q    Okay.  So UTC time is four or five hours ahead of New
8   York time?
9       A    New York.
10       Q    Depending on whether it's Daylight Savings or not?
11       A    Yes.
12       Q    Got it.
13       In July of 2016, was the East Coast, if you know, observing
14   Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time in July?
15       A    I'm not sure.
16       Q    Okay.  Let me ask it a different way.  Was -- is
17   Daylight Savings Time in effect in the summer?
18       A    In the summer?  Yes, that's correct.
19       Q    Okay.  So is it your understanding that during Daylight
20   Savings Time, New York time was four hours behind UTC, but then
21   when you fall back in the fall and for the winter, New York time
22   is five hours behind?
23       A    That's correct.
24       Q    Okay.  So does this exhibit contain the exact copy of
25   text messages that you and Dylan Howard sent to each other on

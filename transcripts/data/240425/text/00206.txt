1                MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
2                THE COURT:  Sustained.
3       Q    Why did you change your testimony?
4       A    I thought that -- I didn't know the exact date.  I
5   thought -- I know it was in the first half of August, so I
6   thought it was the middle of August, that's what I
7   recollected.
8       That's why I corrected my -- the dates, yes.
9       Q    Well, you --
10       A    I didn't believe that the exact date was --
11       Q    I understand.  And I don't mean to put you on the
12   spot.
13       What I'm getting at, though, is that these things happened a
14   long time ago; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    And even when you're doing your best, and I'm sure you
17   are right now, it's hard to remember exactly what happened when;
18   right?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And when you are remembering about conversations that
21   you had, it's hard to remember what people said almost ten years
22   ago; correct?
23       A    You -- Ahhhh, yes.
24       Q    And so there are some instances where your mind sort of
25   fills in gaps; right?

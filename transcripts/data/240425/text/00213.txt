1       Q    But, you also understood that you couldn't say
2   anything different than what you said under oath previously;
3   right?
4       A    What I said under oath was the truth.
5       That's all I planned on doing today.
6       Q    And so, when you met with Mr. Steinglass and the other
7   prosecutors, they gave you a sense of what you'd be asked
8   today; correct?
9       A    Uh, yes.
10       Q    Maybe not a script, but there were no questions that
11   were a surprise to you; correct?
12       A    It was not a script. And -- I wouldn't say about being
13   surprised.
14       Q    You were not surprised; correct?
15       A    No.
16       Q    Now, let's get back to that August 2015 meeting.
17       You testified that Michael Cohen invited you to this
18   meeting; right?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And you had actually known Cohen since the Two
21   Thousands; correct?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    And in your relationship with Michael Cohen, he was
24   somebody that always wanted something for himself; correct?
25       A    Yes.

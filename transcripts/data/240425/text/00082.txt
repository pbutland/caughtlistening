13 Trump was, "You can grab a woman by the genitals," and it was
14 under sexual comments that were made.
15 Q. Was that tape released publically?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Do you recall what happened when that tape was released
18 publically?
19 A. Yes, I do; it was very embarrassing, very damaging to

21 Q. Do you remember the date on which that tape was
22 released?

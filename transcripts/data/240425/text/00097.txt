1       Q.   Why did you use the Signal app?
2       A.   Michael Cohen requested that every time we have a
3   conversation, that I should use the Signal app.
4            And the way he explained it to me, the call is deleted
5   after a period of time, and it's encrypted, there are no
6   messages.
7       Q.   So I am showing you another document.
8            Do you recognize this document to be another record of
9   an interview with you with the FBI?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   Do you know, roughly, what month and year that
12   interview was conducted?
13       A.   When the interview was conducted?
14       Q.   When the interview was conducted.
15       A.   August 2018.
16       Q.   Does that refresh your recollection as to when the
17   three-way conversation took place between yourself, Michael
18   Cohen and Dylan Howard?
19       A.   Yes, it's around the 30th of October, 2016.
20       Q.   Okay.  And I will ask you to keep reading.
21            Take a look at the second paragraph in particular and
22   see whether it does or does not -- does that refresh your
23   recollection with a little bit more precision on that date?
24       A.   Yes, I remember.  I said October 20, I remember it was
25   the end of October.  Yes, that's correct, October 25.

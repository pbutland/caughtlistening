1       Steinglass?
2                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Sure.
3                 THE COURT:  Jurors, so, this document has been
4       accepted into evidence.  I direct you to not consider this
5       document for the truth of its contents.  It is being
6       accepted into evidence for the fact that this invoice was
7       created, not for the truth of what it says.
8                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Thank you, Judge.
9   BY MR. STEINGLASS:
10       Q    Let me ask you this, is it fair to say that you asked
11   Daniel Rotstein to be the middle man to disguise the fact that
12   money would be flowing from Michael Cohen to AMI?
13                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
14                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Sustained.
15       Q    I am not trying to be offensive.
16            Can you just give us a shorter answer, a short answer
17   about why you used Daniel Rotstein in the first place to create
18   this invoice?
19       A    I used Daniel Rotstein to create the invoice because I
20   did not want to have a payment received in the AMI finance
21   department from the Trump Organization or Michael Cohen.
22       Q    Why not?
23       A    Because I believed that that payment would raise a lot
24   of questions and issues and be communicated to the rest of the
25   editors which is something I didn't want to happen.

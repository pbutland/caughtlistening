10   model's story did AMI intend to publish the story or disseminate
11   information about it publicly."

18   September 2016, Cohen called Pecker and stated that he wanted to
19   be assigned to the limited life rights portion of AMI's
20   agreement with the model, which included the requirement that
21   the model not otherwise disclose her story."

24   complete the assignment through a company unaffiliated with
25   AMI."

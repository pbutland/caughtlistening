10   Trump's son-in-law, and at that time he was going to be an

12   shoulder; and he said, "I'll get you upstairs."
13       And we walked -- we went through the resident area of Trump

15   floor, if I recall correctly, and then we walked over to
16   Mr. Trump's office.
17       Q    Just to be clear, this is -- at this time, Mr. Trump
18   was the President-Elect?

20       Q    This was early January 2016 -- 2017?
21       A    2017.
22       Q    So, you said you went to Mr. Trump's office?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Tell us about it. What happened when you got to
25   Mr. Trump's office?

5 A I understood —— I understood he was complaining that
6 he has not been repaid.
7 Q And —— withdrawn.
8 I believe you told us earlier that you had been under the
9 impression that this was going to be paid for by either Donald
10 Trump or The Trump Organization; is that right?
11 A That's correct.
12 Q So, what happens —— withdrawn.
13 Did there come a time when Donald Trump, himself, entered
14 the room?
15 A Yes.
16 While I was having a conversation with Michael Cohen,
17 Donald Trump came into the room; and he —— and Michael Cohen
18 said to Donald Trump that, "I'm talking to David about the ——
19 the —— all the old Enquirer files. I went through them."
20 "I" being Michael Cohen.
21 "I went through the files. We have nothing to be concerned
22 about."
23 And then I asked Mr. Trump, "Can I walk back to your office
24 with you? I want to talk to you about a few things."
25 And he said, "Fine. Come with me."

1   wanted -- "she" being Karen McDougal -- wanted to get back her
2   lifetime rights.
3       Q    So, she wanted out of the Non-Disclosure Agreement?
4       A    That's correct.
5       Q    How was that lawsuit, ultimately, resolved?
6       A    We settled, and I returned her lifetime rights back to
7   Karen.
8       Q    Did you ever communicate with Michael Cohen about the
9   lawsuit while it was pending?
10       A    Yes, I did.
11       Q    And did you tell him what you were planning to do?
12       A    I did.
13       And he thought that was a very bad idea. He couldn't
14   understand why I would agree to anything like that.
15       And I told him that she's very upset, I'm not going to
16   continue on with the potential litigation, and I'm just gonna
17   give her back her rights.
18       Q    Is that what you did?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    Now, a few days after Ms. McDougal's appearance on
21   Anderson Cooper, did you also come to learn that Stormy Daniels
22   was interviewed by Anderson Cooper?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And did you watch that broadcast when it aired?
25       A    I did.

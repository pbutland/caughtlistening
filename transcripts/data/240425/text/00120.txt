1   was asking you?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    Can you please share with us that recollection?
4       A    Prior to the election, if a negative story was coming
5   out with respect to Donald Trump and we spoke about it, he was
6   always concerned about -- he was concerned about Melania --
7   Melania Trump, he was concerned about Ivanka, he was concerned
8   about what the family might hear or say about it. Not saying
9   whether it was true or not.
10       After the campaign, and when I was in his office and we
11   were discussing this, he was concerned on the doorman story
12   with respect to if the -- if the story came out, which wasn't
13   true, about him having an illegitimate child -- and I didn't
14   hear or discuss that it was -- he was concerned that what would
15   Melania say, or what would Ivanka say, what his family would
16   say.
17       It was, basically, what would be -- the impact be to the
18   campaign or election.
19       Q    Was that true for your conversations with Donald Trump
20   about the Karen McDougal story, as well?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    After Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for President,
23   did he ever say anything to you that indicated that he was
24   concerned about what Melania Trump or Ivanka Trump would think
25   about these affairs?

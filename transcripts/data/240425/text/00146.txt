1                 THE COURT:  When would you like the limiting
2        instructions?
3                 MR. BOVE:  When it's admitted, please.
4                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I actually do think that's a
5        fair characterization of it.
6                 In any event, to the extent that the operation of
7        the witness' mind differs from the agreement, the
8        agreement will be in, and everything will be cleared up.
9                 That's how I read the agreement, is that they
10        admitted to a campaign finance violation.
11                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
12        in open court:)
13                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
14        in open court:)
15                 THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.
16       Q    In addition to that, did this agreement impose a
17   requirement on AMI and its representatives to cooperate and
18   give truthful testimony and information?
19       A    Yes.
20       Q    And as a result of that, would AMI not be criminally
21   prosecuted for campaign finance violations?
22       A    That is correct.
23       Q    As part of that agreement, did AMI make several
24   admissions, including in Statements of Facts?
25       A    Yes, they did.

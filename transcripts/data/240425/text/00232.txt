1 I am only asking now if the Court will permit us
2 to make the application tomorrow.
3 I don't want to discuss the member of The Trump
4 Organization we have been working with.
5 We gave notice to the Counsel of the Trump
6 Organization.
7 We will be asking the Court —— my understanding
8 is, Counsel of the Trump Organization will be present
9 tomorrow on the Court's application, except for the very
10 end of the day because of Sabbath observance.
11 THE COURT: The best time to do it is at the end
12 of the morning. The best time to do it will be before we
13 break for lunch. You can do it then.
14 See you tomorrow at 9:30.
15 Just for the record, the Order to Show Cause,
16 certain dates I believe —— I don't have a copy in front of
17 me right now.
18 I believe the Defense has been given until Monday
19 at 5:00 PM to respond, and we're going to have a hearing
20 on that on Wednesday at 2:15.
21 Thank you.
22 (Whereupon, the case is adjourned to April 26,
23 2024.)

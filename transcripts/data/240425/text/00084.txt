1       Q.   And did you have any conversation with Michael Cohen
2   about a Radar Online article?
3       A.   Yes.  The Radar Online is a digital website.  It was
4   launched in late 2000, and American Media acquired it during
5   that period of time.
6            And unbeknownst to me, Michael Cohen said that on that
7   digital site there is a posting of Donald Trump being a Playboy
8   Man and I should immediately take it down.  That Mr. Trump was
9   very upset.
10            I said to Michael, I was unaware of this posting.
11       Q.   I'm going to show you what's in evidence as People's
12   167.  I will show everyone actually.
13            And I am going to ask you, if you recognize this email?
14       A.   Yes, I do.
15       Q.   What is it?
16       A.   This is the email that after I spoke to Michael Cohen,
17   I called up Dylan Howard and I asked him about this Playboy Man
18   article on Donald Trump, and he discovered that this was posted
19   prior to our position.  I was also unaware of it.  He would take
20   it down immediately.
21            So I said to him, do that, notify Michael, remove the
22   article and notify Michael Cohen.
23            The email that he sent here is explaining it to Michael
24   about the story.

1 Q And did he say why he wanted you to try to buy the
2 story?
3 A Well, first he said the story wasn't true.
4 Then he said that he thought that having that story out ——
5 and I should add on, Dylan mentioned that ABC was interested in
6 acquiring the story.
7 He also mentioned that a Mexican group made an offer for the
8 story for 8 million dollars.
9 Michael and I both said that although we didn't believe that
10 there was a Mexican group that was going to buy the story, the
11 ABC offer was interesting because they were offering apparently
12 Karen a slot on Dancing with the Stars.
13 But I knew from my experience that ABC doesn't buy stories,
14 so I didn't think they were paying cash for the story.
15 He —— Dylan, also mentioned that Karen McDougal said that
16 she didn't want her story to be published.
17 She said she didn't want to be the next Monica Lewinsky.
18 She said that she wanted to restart her career.
19 He said that —— this is Dylan —— Dylan said that she was
20 a —— apparently a —— originally a fitness model.
21 And she was the first female model on one of the covers of
22 one of my magazines, for one of American Media's magazines,
23 which was Men's Fitness. This was in —— on a cover in 1999.
24 So he felt that she would be more interested in coming —— in
25 having American Media buying the story than anyone else.

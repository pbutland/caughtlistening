1       A.   That would have been Saturday, October 8th.
2       Q.   Thank you.
3            I will take it back.
4                 MR. BOVE:  I object.  Technically that answer is
5        nonresponsive.  The question is; does that refresh your
6        recollection?
7                 THE COURT:  I will allow it.
8       Q.   Now, after your initial conversation with Dylan
9   Howard, did you have a series of texts back and forth with him?
10       A.   Yes, I did.
11                 (Displayed.)
12       Q.   I am showing you what is in evidence as People's
13   174A, and as we're pulling it up, we can show it to everyone,
14   please.
15            I am going to ask if this is a record of texts between
16   you and Dylan Howard from October and November of 2016?
17       A.   That's correct.
18                 MR. STEINGLASS:  And I am going to ask that we
19        blow up the last column or the lines marked 47.260 through
20        265.
21                 (Displayed.)
22       Q.   Are you able to read that, Mr. Pecker?
23       A.   Yes, I can.
24       Q.   My first question is:  What is the date and timestamp
25   on the first text?

1       A.   I said, we already paid $30,000 to the doorman, we paid
2   $150,000 to Karen McDougal, and I am not a bank.  I am not
3   paying out any further disbursements among us.
4       Q.   How, if, at all, did Dylan Howard respond?
5       A.   He said:  "Okay, they need to handle it.  Perhaps I
6   should call Michael and advise him and he could take it from
7   there and handle it."
8       Q.   Who did you understand "they" to be referring to?
9       A.   Michael Cohen and Donald Trump.
10       Q.   And how did you respond to that?
11       A.   I responded, I said, "Yes, a good idea."
12       Q.   Why did you think it was a good idea to kick this over
13   to Michael Cohen?
14       A.   I thought the story, the way Dylan described it, could
15   be very damaging.  I thought it should come off the market.  If
16   anyone was going to buy it, I thought Michael Cohen and Donald
17   Trump should buy it.
18       Q.   To be clear here, Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard came to you,
19   Dylan Howard came to you after having been contacted by his
20   sources, Keith Davidson and Gina Rodriguez?
21       A.   That's right.
22                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
23                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       Q.   How did you first learn of Stormy Daniels in this
25   context?

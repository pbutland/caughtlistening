1                 So, let me start with the texts from June and
2       July.
3                 THE COURT:  If I can just interrupt you for a
4       second.  Is it your argument that because these were
5       obtained from an AMI device, that's what makes it a
6       business record?
7                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I am saying that they are not
8       business records.  I am saying that they are
9       authentic because they came from an AMI device and the
10       foundation for authenticity was laid, but I am not seeking
11       to admit them as business records.
12                 THE COURT:  Neither one of these parties are
13       going to be testifying here, right?
14                 MR. STEINGLASS:  That's true.  But I -- I still
15       think I have an argument.
16                 THE COURT:  If you can just approach and let me
17       know what the relationship is that we are talking about.
18                      (Whereupon, the proceedings continued
19                 without a side-bar discussion taking place.)
20                      (Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan
21                 Pearce-Bates, was relieved by Senior Court
22                 Reporter, Theresa Magniccari.)

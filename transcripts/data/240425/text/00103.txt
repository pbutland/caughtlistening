3       Q    Now, around the time of this Wall Street Journal
4   article on November 4th, did a Wall Street Journal reporter
5   contact AMI for comment?
6       A    Yes, they did.
7       Q    And did AMI put out a statement claiming that, quote:
8   AMI had not paid people to kill damaging stories about
9   Mr. Trump?
10       A    Yes. That was the statement that we issued.
11       Q    Was that the truth?
12       A    No, it was not.
13       Q    Did AMI also claim that the payment to McDougal was
14   not for her story, but, rather, for her columns and her
15   exclusive life rights?
16       A    That's correct.
17       Q    Was that true?
18       A    No, it was not.
19       Q    Who authorized those statements?
20       A    I did.
21       Q    Why did you authorize AMI to put out false statements
22   about the true nature of the deal with Karen McDougal?
23       A    I wanted to protect my company; I wanted to protect
24   myself; and I wanted, also, to protect Donald Trump.
25       Q    I'm going to show you People's Exhibit 174 again.

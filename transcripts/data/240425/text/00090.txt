1       A.   It's 2016, October 9.  The time is UTC time.  So it
2   would be -- I remember it was about 10 o'clock at night.  I am
3   not sure how you calculate that.
4       Q.   Let's see if we can work together.
5            0025, is that 12:25 a.m. in UTC time?
6       A.   Yes.
7       Q.   Now, I think you testified earlier that during
8   daylight savings UTC time is four hours ahead of New York time?
9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   If it's 12:25 a.m. UTC, does that correspond to 8:25
11   New York time?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Where was it that you were having dinner with your
14   wife?  I don't want the restaurant, just the city.
15       A.   In Greenwich, Connecticut.
16       Q.   Also New York time?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Who is this text from?
19       A.   Dylan Howard.
20       Q.   And who is the text to?
21       A.   It was to me.  "Woman wants $120,000, has offers from
22   The Mail and GMA.  Want her to talk and do lie detector live.
23   I know the denials were made in the past, but this story is
24   true.  I can lock it on publication now to shut down the media
25   chatter and we can access next steps thereafter.  Okay?"

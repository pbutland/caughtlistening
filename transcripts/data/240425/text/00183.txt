1       A    I thought it came earlier.
2       Q    What was the Trump Style?
3       A    It was a magazine that -- it's a custom -- I would say
4   it's a custom magazine, and the editorial point of view was
5   everything about Mr. Trump:  His brand, the concept of the
6   magazine, his hotels, the apartments, the casinos, and then we
7   wrote the editorials surrounding that.
8       Q    And so we can agree that Trump Style is in the early or
9   mid '90s; is that more consistent with your recollection?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    So even by that period you were looking to President
12   Trump as somebody who can help the National Enquirer make money;
13   correct?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    And it was always your intention, dating back to the
16   early parts of this friendship, to not publish negative stories
17   about President Trump; correct?
18       A    Yes.
19       Q    It was not good for business; correct?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    And it was not good for your relationship with
22   President Trump; right?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And that was not unique to President Trump; was it?
25       A    Can you rephrase that, please.

1       A    That's correct.
2       Q    Fair to say that predated that meeting at Trump Tower

7       Q    And several stories; right?
8       A    Yes.
9       Q    In addition to Trump Style, you also used the National
10   Enquirer to run positive stories about President Trump; right?

16       Q    And this sort of took off, this idea of using the
17   National Enquirer to promote President Trump because it was good
18   for you around the time of The Apprentice, the first show?
19       A    That's correct.
20       Q    And this is in the early 2000s; correct?
21       A    Yes.
22       Q    And I think you said on Tuesday, by that time, early
23   2000s, you and President Trump had a mutually-beneficial
24   relationship; correct?
25       A    That is correct.

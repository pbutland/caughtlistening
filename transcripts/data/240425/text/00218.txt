Page 1315
1   it was really important to get all the details out; correct?
2       A    Yes.
3       Q    That's what the prosecutors demanded; right?
4       A    Yes.
5       Q    And that's what the agents demanded; right?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    And in this meeting, the July 26, 2018 meeting, you
8   did not tell anyone that Hope Hicks participated in the
9   August 2015 meeting; correct?
10                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Objection.
11                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
12                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
13        at sidebar:)
14                 THE COURT:  What's the objection?
15                 MR. STEINGLASS:  My objection is Bornholdt.
16                 THE COURT:  It's what?
17                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Bornholdt.
18                 He hasn't laid the foundation that Mr. Pecker was
19        asked that question; so he's trying to impeach by
20        omission, without laying the foundation.
21                 Either he was specifically asked about that, or
22        the omission would be unnatural. It's certainly not that
23        level of fact that qualifies as an admission being
24        unnatural.
25                 It's, clearly, a Bornholdt violation.

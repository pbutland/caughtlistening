1       And then as he became Governor -- and one of the stories
2   that I acquired, I wasn't going to publish, and the person who
3   took that story -- and since we didn't -- since the company --
4   since we didn't publish it, she brought it to the Los Angeles
5   Times and the LA Times published the story.
6       It was very embarrassing.
7       Most of the press approached Arnold Schwarzenegger when he
8   was Governor about this story.
9       And his comment was:  "I didn't know."
10       He said:  "Ask my friend David Pecker."
11       So it was very embarrassing to me and the company.
12       And at that time there was an investigation by the State
13   with respect to Arnold being the editor of -- being an
14   Editor-at-Large for these two titles.
15       He had to resign.
16       And it was a difficult situation.
17       And it gave me the sensitivity about buying any stories in
18   the future.
19       So that's where -- that's how I became sensitive on this
20   topic.
21       Q    So let me just ask you one more question about the end
22   of what you were just saying.
23       Did -- as a result of your agreement to purchase stories,
24   negative stories about Arnold Schwarzenegger on behalf of Arnold
25   Schwarzenegger when he was running for Governor of California,

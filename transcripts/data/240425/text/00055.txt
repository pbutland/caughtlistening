Page 1152
1       consultant outside of AMI, not employed by AMI, prepared
2       it.  It is not his statement.
3                 THE COURT:  He didn't have to prepare it.
4                 Does he know this document?  Has he seen the
5       document?
6                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes.  Daniel Rotstein worked
7       part-time for AMI and I think the witness laid the business
8       record foundation.
9                 THE COURT:  I am going to allow it.
10                 Are you asking for a limiting instruction
11       regarding the document?
12                 MR. BOVE:  Judge, we would ask just to make sure
13       that a foundation is laid that Mr. Pecker saw this
14       contemporaneously.
15                 THE COURT:  Sure.
16                 MR. BOVE:  Thank you.
17                      (Discussion at side-bar concluded, and the
18                 following occurred in open court.)
19   BY MR. STEINGLASS:
20       Q    So you told us, I believe, Mr. Pecker, that there was
21   an invoice prepared for this reimbursement, is that right?
22       A    Yes, that's correct.
23       Q    I would like to show what is in evidence and is being
24   displayed as People's Exhibit 161.
25            Do you recognize this document?

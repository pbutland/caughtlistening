1        Mr. Howard used as an intermediary for at least one of his
2        stories.
3                 So, our position here is that there are
4        substantive factual assertions by Rodriguez in this text
5        chain.
6                 There's not a foundation that she is
7        participating in a conspiracy. She's just reporting
8        information to Mr. Howard.
9                 Howard then, specifically in these messages,
10        because of the substantive factual assertions being made
11        to him, he's not making statements in furtherance of a
12        conspiracy by speaking to her.
13                 THE COURT:  Do you have a copy that I could look
14        at?
15                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think it was in the binder
16        that I handed up this morning.
17                 I can give you another copy.
18                 THE COURT:  Yes.  I'll take that.
19                 MR. STEINGLASS:  No problem.
20                 (Whereupon, a document is shown to the Court.)
21                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Whenever the Court is ready, I
22        would like to be heard on that.
23                 THE COURT:  Okay.
24                 MR. STEINGLASS:  First of all, in response to
25        Counsels' objections, we removed a portion of the exchange

5       Q    Did you see this as a way to recoup the money, or at
6   least some of the money, that you had laid out on behalf of
7   Mr. Trump to buy the story?
8       A    Yes.  I, as I said, it was coming towards the end of

12       A    Yes.

21       through this document, I can get through the initial half
22       without taking a break if you want.
23                 Last night, counsel told us that they did not

25       services to be offered for the truth.

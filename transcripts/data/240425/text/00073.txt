1       business records.
2                 I actually, this is more an issue I think for
3       cross at this point, but Mr. Pecker testified that AMI
4       collected business communications from business phones.
5       These are personal communications perhaps on an AMI phone.
6                 So there is -- I don't think there is a plausible
7       argument that the text of the communications are business
8       records.  So they should not come in.
9                 THE COURT:  Mr. Steinglass, these are texts
10       between Dylan Howard and another person.
11                 Does that other person work at AMI or have
12       anything to do with AMI?
13                 MR. STEINGLASS:  So, no, Judge.  I think I can
14       provide some color here without mentioning exactly who it
15       is.  It is a first degree relative of Mr. Howard.
16                 And to be clear, we are not trying to admit these
17       as business records.  They have already been authenticated
18       so far as they came from an AMI device.  And they do,
19       undoubtedly, contain a bit of hearsay.  I agree with Mr.
20       Bove on that.
21                 I think that it is useful to -- I think that they
22       are independently admissible.  And I think it's useful to
23       break the texts into two groups.  One are the texts from
24       June and July of 2016, and the other are the texts from
25       November, 2016, really from election night.

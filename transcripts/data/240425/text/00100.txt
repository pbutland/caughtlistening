14        instruction.
15                 THE COURT:  Again, jurors, it's not being admitted
16        for the truth of the matters asserted, simply that it was
17        proof that it was published on that date.
18                 (Whereupon, exhibit was received in evidence.)
19                 MR. STEINGLASS:  If I could publish it to everyone
20        now.

22       Q.   I am going to ask you, Mr. Pecker, did the article
23   reveal the fact that AMI had paid McDougal the rights to the
24   story about the affair with Donald Trump?
25       A.   Yes.

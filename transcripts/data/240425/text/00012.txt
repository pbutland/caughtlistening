1       A    Michael Cohen was constantly calling me while Dylan
2   Howard was in this meeting interviewing Karen McDougal.
3       And I told Michael that as soon as I hear from Dylan, I will
4   set up a three-way call.
5       Q    And did that three-way call actually happen?
6       A    Yes.  Yes, it did.
7       I used -- Michael Cohen told me to make sure that I used
8   Signal.
9       So I set up the Signal call between myself, Michael Cohen
10   and Dylan Howard.
11       Q    And tell us about that conversation, please?
12       A    Dylan described exactly what I just mentioned about who
13   Karen McDougal was, and all of the details that I just stated.
14   And immediately Michael Cohen said it's not true, which is
15   something that he always said.
16       And then he said, let me -- let me check it out and I will
17   come back to you.
18       Q    Was there any discussion on that three-way call about
19   acquiring the rights to Karen McDougal's story?
20       A    Yes.  Michael said that -- well, I will take -- let me
21   just clarify:
22       When Dylan suggested that he offered $10,000 to buy Karen's
23   story, which is including the entire story, what she was
24   claiming, and she refused, Michael suggested that we should go
25   ahead to try to buy the story.

1   did you come to appreciate the legalities surrounding such an
2   arrangement with a political candidate?
3       A    Yes.  That was the first time I ever came across a
4   political violation -- a political contribution, what a
5   violation was.
6       Q    And what, if any --
7                MR. BOVE:  Judge, I object to the word "violation"
8       and move to strike.
9                THE COURT:  Sustained.
10       Q    What did you, in your mind, take away from that
11   experience that you had as a result of the Arnold Schwarzenegger
12   situation?
13       A    Based on what happened 14 years ago, I wanted to be
14   comfortable that the agreement that we were going to prepare for
15   Karen McDougal met all -- all the obligations with respect to a
16   campaign contribution.
17       Q    Now, you told us that there was -- withdrawn.
18       Did there come a time, and I don't want to get into what you
19   discussed with any attorney --
20       A    Yep.
21       Q    But, did there come a time that someone at AMI
22   consulted with an election law attorney?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    And did there come a time that you finalized a deal
25   with Karen McDougal?

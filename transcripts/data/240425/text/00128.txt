1        Stormy Daniels story, discussions about the Stormy Daniels
2        story. It is really a core part of the conspiracy.
3                 So, I think any possibility of prejudice can be
4        cured, as it has with several other documents, by
5        instructing the jury that any factual assertions in the
6        Rodriguez portions of those texts should not be considered
7        for the truth, but only to contextualize Mr. Howard's
8        responses.
9                 If there's one or two lines that are not
10        necessary to contextualize Ms. Rodriguez's -- Mr. Howard's
11        communications, and Defense Counsel wants to bring those
12        one or two lines to our attention, we can consider whether
13        it's appropriate to redact them.
14                 We are not looking to prove the truth of what
15        Ms. Rodriguez is saying.
16                 However, what she's saying is semi-important in
17        terms of what AMI's motivation was in terms of buying up
18        that story and preventing it from being released.
19                 THE COURT:  I'm looking at 15 pages of texts?
20                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Yes. It is 15 pages of texts.
21                 I don't think it has to be resolved today,
22        insofar as I don't think we're going to walk through these
23        texts with Mr. Pecker.
24                 So, if Your Honor wants to take a look and see if
25        there's specific offending texts that Your Honor feels are

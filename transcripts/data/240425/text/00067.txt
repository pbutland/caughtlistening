1       event.  There is no statement in here that we are trying to
2       prove the truth of.  It is admissible to show the fact that
3       AMI released Sajudin from the NDA and the date they
4       released him.
5                 There is nothing coming in for its truth in a
6       traditional sense anyway.

21       would address the content of the communication that is
22       involved.
23                 THE COURT:  Turning to the second argument, I
24       don't necessarily agree that this is not being offered for
25       the truth of the matter asserted.  It's always such a

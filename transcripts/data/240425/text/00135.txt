1       A    Dylan came to my office and said that he spoke to
2   Keith Davidson, and Keith thought that it would be a good idea
3   that if I had a lunch with Karen McDougal, they would like to
4   come to New York for a meeting, see the offices of American
5   Media.
6       Q    What was the purpose of the lunch?
7       Let me ask you this. What was discussed at the lunch?
8       A    When we had lunch -- when I had lunch with Karen, she
9   talked about the articles that she was preparing with the ghost
10   writers. She was a little bit upset because Dylan Howard had to
11   change some of the ghost writers because they weren't working
12   well with Karen.
13       And, she talked about her idea and concept of going forward
14   and launching a -- a -- some beauty products that we talked
15   about, originally, that she brought up in the original
16   agreement.
17       Then she, subsequently, said that she wasn't pleased
18   because everything was taking -- everything -- the articles
19   were taking a while, she hasn't been, um -- trained for media
20   training, because she wanted to be that anchor on the red
21   carpet for Radar -- for the Radar digital site.
22       So, she was stating what she would like to get done.
23       From my standpoint, the purpose of the meeting was to make
24   sure that we were complying to her agreement and that she was
25   comfortable with what we committed to her on what we were going

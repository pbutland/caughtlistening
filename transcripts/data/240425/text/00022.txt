1       So he said:  "You should pay."
2       I said:  "Michael" -- I said -- "why would I pay?  I just
3   paid $30,000 for the doorman story."
4       I said:  "Now you're asking me to pay $150,000 for the Karen
5   story, plus all of these other additional items that she wants
6   to do."
7       "I don't have a problem in doing everything else that she
8   requested about writing for the magazines, to be on the cover of
9   the books -- of the fitness titles.  That's not an issue.  That
10   I don't have a problem with."
11       "The $150,000, who is going to reimburse me for this?"
12       So he said, again:  "Don't worry about it.  I'm your friend.
13   The Boss will take care of it."
14       Q    And, again, not to beat a dead horse, but when you
15   have -- when Michael Cohen told you:  "Don't worry, The Boss
16   will take care of it," what did you understand that to mean?
17       A    "The Boss" would have been Donald Trump.
18       Q    And "take care of it" means what?
19       A    That either -- that I would be reimbursed either from
20   the Trump Organization or from Donald Trump.
21       Q    Okay.
22                MR. STEINGLASS:  I am now going to display to
23       everyone what's in evidence as People's Exhibit 173A.
24       Q    You can start with Page 1.

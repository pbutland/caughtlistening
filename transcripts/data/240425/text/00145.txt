8 at sidebar:)
9 THE COURT: What's the objection?
10 MR. BOVE: I may have misheard.
11 I thought I may have heard he admitted to a
12 election violation.
13 THE COURT: Can you read that back?
14 (Whereupon, the requested portion was read back
15 by the court reporter.)
16 MR. BOVE: I think that's a mischaracterization
17 of the agreement.
18 We understand the agreement is coming in with a
19 limited instruction.
20 We don't think there should be testimony about
21 what he did there.
22 THE COURT: The agreement is coming in?
23 MR. BOVE: Yes. We're not going to object.
24 It's coming in subject to the limiting
25 instructions.

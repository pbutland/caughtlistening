1 But for the time being, I am excluding these
2 texts.
3 The fact that they’re there, you're not offering
4 them for business records —— the fact that they came off an
5 AMI device to me is of no consequence. The fact that
6 Dylan Howard is one of the individuals texting and we
7 established that he is one of the co—conspirators within
8 this context is also of no consequence to me.
9 Ultimately, what we have here is a private
10 conversation between the co—conspirator and a family member
11 that has nothing to do with the business that is being
12 offered for its truth. And I don't see how the defense
13 gets to cross examine anyone on this.
14 There is a real confrontation clause issue with
15 this. I think that it would be error at this point to
16 allow it.
17 I will go back and read the decisions, see what I
18 am missing, but I think there is a confrontation clause
19 issue.
20 Anything else?
21 MR. BOVE: There’s one more exhibit, we don’t
22 necessarily need to take it up now.
23 THE COURT: We will get to it in the morning.
24 MR. BOVE: Okay.
25 THE COURT: So let’s bring the witness back.

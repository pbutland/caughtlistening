1       A.   Dylan called me to tell me that he verified that Karen
2   McDougal is not speaking to ABC.
3            I called back Keith Schiller and I asked him to relay
4   that to The Boss, what he heard is not true.
5       Q.   And what, if anything, did Keith Schiller say in
6   response?
7       A.   He responded back and said The Boss was very pleased.
8       Q.   All right.
9            So directing your attention to November --
10                 MR. BOVE:  Objection.
11                 Move to strike the last answer.
12                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
13                 What is the last question?
14       Q.   Directing your attention to November 4, 2016, did you
15   become aware that the Wall Street Journal published an article
16   that day revealing aspects of the Karen McDougal's story?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   How did you become aware of that?
19       A.   Our communications director from American Media
20   received a number of calls from the Wall Street Journal and had
21   a series of questions about Karen McDougal's agreement; that
22   American Media purchased her story on her relationship with
23   Donald Trump, and also they questioned my relationship with
24   Donald Trump.

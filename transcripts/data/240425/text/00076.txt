1   known only to me and D.P.," which is David Pecker.
2            And the response:  "Information is powerful."
3            Then flipping to Page 4, this is also on the same
4   day in June.  Mr. Howard tells his relative:  "Nothing is
5   on email," et cetera.  "Burner phones."
6            And another text:  "I thought about it.
7   Information is powerful, and I'm collecting a lot."
8            So this first group of texts, we believe, are
9   admissible as to Howard's state of mind, including
10   declarations of future intent.  He is a co-conspirator.  As
11   we've already discussed, his state of mind is relative.
12   Declarations of future intent are exceptions to the hearsay
13   rule, and we provided some law, both in our memo and in the
14   cases that I've handed up.
15            Primarily, People versus James.  That's 93
16   N.Y. 2nd 620, at Page 628 to 631, which is Court of Appeals
17   from 1999, which discusses Hillman, which is a U. S.
18   Supreme Court case at 145 U.S. 285.
19            So those texts we believe are admissible on
20   those grounds, a state of mind and declaration of future
21   intent.
22            I think that the text -- there is another category
23   of texts, and we're happy to redact the intervening texts
24   that don't fall into one of these categories.
25            The next -- I skipped one from July 26, 2026, on

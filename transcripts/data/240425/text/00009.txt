1                THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Conroy.
2                Anything else?
3                Just getting back to those two exhibits that were
4       admitted on Tuesday.
5                I found that one was a true business record.
6                The other one -- because it was an email that
7       basically summarized the transaction.
8                And so that's my ruling on that one.
9                If you want to be heard on my other ruling, though,
10       we can take that up now.
11                MR. STEINGLASS:  We are okay to wait until we take
12       them all up.
13                THE COURT:  Okay.  Very good.  Get the witness,
14       please.

16                (The witness, David Pecker, enters the courtroom
17       and resumes the witness stand.)

20                THE WITNESS:  Okay.
21                Good morning, Judge.
22                THE COURT:  Good morning, Mr. Pecker.  Welcome
23       back.

1       A    I would have to ask you to repeat it again.
2       Q    Were you aware that expenditures by corporations made
3   for the purpose of influencing an election, made in
4   coordination with or at the request of a candidate or a
5   campaign, are unlawful?
6       A    Yes.
7       Q    Did either you or AMI ever report to the Federal
8   Election Commission in 2016 that AMI had made a $150,000
9   payment to Karen McDougal?
10       A    No, we did not.
11       Q    Why did AMI make this purchase of Karen McDougal's
12   story?
13       A    We purchased the story so it wouldn't be published by
14   any other organization.
15       Q    And why did you not want it to be published by any
16   other organization?
17       A    I didn't want -- we didn't want the story to embarrass
18   Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign.
19       Q    When you say, we, who is we?
20       A    Myself and Michael Cohen.
21       Q    But for Mr. Cohen's promise to reimburse AMI --
22   withdrawn.
23            But for Mr. Cohen's promise that Mr. Trump would
24   reimburse AMI, would you have entered into this agreement?
25       A    No.

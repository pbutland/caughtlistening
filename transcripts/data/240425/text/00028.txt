1 He's referring to primarily the Globe and the National
2 Enquirer.
3 And he said, and as I mentioned, I think, on Monday, we
4 acquired them in March of 1999.
5 He said that: "I've had a number of litigation and lawsuits
6 against both magazines because you always run negative stories
7 about me."
8 And he said: ”I plan on running for Governor, and I would
9 like for you not to publish any negative stories on me now."
10 I should say: "Any negative stories about me now or in the
11 future, and I will continue on being the editor for Muscle
12 Fitness and Flex, as the spokesperson."
13 So I agreed.
14 And shortly after, he announced on the Jay Leno Show that he
15 was running for Governor.
16 And a number —— after he made that announcement, a number of
17 women called up the National Enquirer about, about —— about
18 stories that they had —— that they have, I should say, to sell
19 on different relationships or contacts and sexual harassment
20 that they felt that Arnold Schwarzenegger did.
21 And the deal that I had —— the agreement, I should say, that
22 I had with Arnold is that I would call him and advise him of any
23 stories that were out there.
24 And I ended up acquiring —— buying them for a period of
25 time.

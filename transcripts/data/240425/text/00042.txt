1   blown up has the account information -- the account
2   information, et cetera?  That's AMI's internal recordkeeping of
3   how they are kind of recording this expense in their own books?
4       A    That's correct.
5       Q    Why was this amount coded to the President's
6   Department?
7       A    From a budgetary standpoint, the editor's budget is
8   very limited.  As I previously mentioned the other day, they --
9   I should say today, you -- they can spend no more than $10,000
10   on their own.
11            This is a very, very large purchase.  And from the
12   budgetary standpoint, I budget in the President's account an
13   overall number budget that during the year if there are great
14   photos to buy, something unusual, unique, the President's
15   budget has the expense for it.
16       Q    And, incidentally, is that the same way you accounted
17   for payment to Dino Sajudin?
18       A    Yes, it was.
19       Q    So getting back to this, did Karen McDougal -- did
20   AMI, in fact, pay the $150,000 for Karen McDougal's lifetime
21   rights?
22       A    Yes, we did.
23       Q    I believe you said you accomplished that by a wire
24   transfer?
25       A    Yes.

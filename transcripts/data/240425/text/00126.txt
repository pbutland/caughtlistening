1        that post-dated the conspiracy; and so, we're only seeking
2        to admit the texts that go up through October of 2016.
3                 These are, first off, admissible as a business
4        record, insofar as it was the regular course of AMI's
5        business to purchase stories such as Ms. Daniels' story;
6        and Howard conducted that business as part of the regular
7        job responsibilities and was under the business duty to do
8        so truthfully.
9                 Again, even if the underlying content isn't
10        admissible as a business record, the Court has determined
11        Mr. Howard is a co-conspirator; and these are core
12        statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, insofar as
13        they involve discussions with Ms. Rodriguez involving the
14        acquisition of the Stormy Daniels story.
15                 I do agree with Mr. Bove, the factual statements
16        contained in Ms. Rodriguez's texts should not be
17        considered for the truth, and her portion of the
18        conversation should only be admitted to contextualize
19        Mr. Howard's conversations with her.
20                 MR. BOVE:  I think we're basically on the same
21        page.
22                 Our point here is, admittedly, somewhat new on
23        this one.
24                 Judge, in exercising your discretion about what's

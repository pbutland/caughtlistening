1   Ms. McDougal? Did you speak about that with Michael Cohen?
2       A    Yes, I did.
3       Q    And how did he -- what did he say about that?
4       A    He said it was a very bad idea.  That -- that The Boss
5   would be very angry.  That, why did you pay her the $150,000?
6            And he highly recommended that I didn't amend the
7   agreement or allow her to speak to the press.
8       Q    Did you take that advice?
9       A    No, I didn't.
10       Q    I'm now showing you what's in evidence already as
11   People's Exhibit 157.
12                 MR. STEINGLASS:  We can show this to everyone.
13                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
14       Q    Do you recognize this document?
15       A    Yes, I do.
16       Q    What is it?
17       A    This is the amendment to the licensing agreement of
18   Karen McDougal to allow her to speak to the press.
19       Q    Why did you want to allow Ms. McDougal to speak to the
20   press at this point?
21       A    I felt that the -- The Wall Street Journal article
22   already set the stage and the tone of what the story is. And I
23   wanted to try and keep some form of control on -- around the
24   story, so -- so it's not gonna go any further than where it
25   already was out in the public marketplace. That was one.

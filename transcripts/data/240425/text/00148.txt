1 that while David Pecker was an executive at AMI, AMI
2 entered into a Non—Prosecution Agreement with federal
3 prosecutors, as well as a Conciliation Agreement with the
4 Federal Election Commission.
5 That evidence was permitted to assist you, the
6 jury, in assessing David Pecker's credibility and to help
7 provide context for some of those surrounding events.
8 You may consider that testimony for those
9 purposes only.
10 Neither the Non—Prosecution Agreement, nor the
11 Conciliation Agreement is evidence of the Defendant's
12 guilt, and you may not consider them in determining
13 whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the
14 charged crimes.
15 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.

20 Q I'm going to ask you, Mr. Pecker, what is the date of
21 this Non—Prosecution Agreement?
22 A September 20, 2018.
23 Q Okay.
24 I am going to ask you to walk us through portions of it.

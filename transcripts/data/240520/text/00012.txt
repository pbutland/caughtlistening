Proceedings

1 because it sought to instruct the jury on matters of law.
2 Likewise, Mr. Smith was precluded from testifying
3 about similar subjects in United States v. Suarez in the
4 Northern District of Ohio. In Suarez, the Court ruled that
5 the proposed testimony was irrelevant because, quote:
6 Whether the law is commonly misunderstood does not weigh
7 on whether the defendant in this case intended to violate
8 Campaign Finance Laws.
9 The same holds true here.
10 The fact that both parties have submitted
11 proposed jury instructions does not change this Court's
12 prior rulings on the Omnibus Motions and the Motions in
13 Limine and does not in itself make relevant what is not
14 relevant.
15 The proposed jury instructions are just that:
16 proposals.
17 The Court will hear argument, consider the
18 submissions, and then decide whether to accept one
19 version, or the other, or a combination of both, or
20 possibly neither. The Court may craft its own instructions
21 or decide that no instruction is necessary at all.
22 Therefore, I again invite you to submit proposed
23 jury instructions regarding the "Irrespective Rule" and
24 "For the purpose of influencing an election for Federal
25 office".

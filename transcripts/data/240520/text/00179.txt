4                 THE SERGEANT:  Remain seated.  Part 59 back in
5        session.
6                 THE COURT:  Before you went to lunch, we had a
7        discussion regarding the People's proposal to introduce
8        into evidence two videos, or at least stills taken from
9        videos.  The defense objected.
10                 Over lunch I did receive the People's submission,
11        just Section 9.14 of the Rules of Evidence.
12                 Also, People v. Goldman, G-O-L-D-M-A-N.  That is
13        a Court of Appeals decision, 35 NY 3d 582.
14                 I had the opportunity to read through the
15        testimony of Dr. Browning.  I wanted to see exactly what he
16        had testified to and what kind of foundation he made.  I
17        was able to do that.
18                 So beginning on Page 1664, I will be jumping
19        around a little bit.
20                 But Page 1664:
21                 "QUESTION:  What is your position at C-Span?
22                 "ANSWER:  Executive Director of the C-Span
23        Archives.
24                 "QUESTION:  How long have you held that position?
25                 ANSWER:  Thirty-seven years."

M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4143
1       Q.   Let me ask you:  Was that a true statement?
2       A.   No, ma'am.
3                 THE COURT:  Are you asking for an instruction?
4                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
5                 THE COURT:  All right.
6                 Jurors, you just heard the questions that were
7        asked of Mr. Cohen and his response that it was not a true
8        statement.
9                 Put it back up.
10                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It was the third paragraph.
11                 THE COURT:  That the payment in question does not
12        constitute a campaign contribution or expenditure, and Mr.
13        Cohen responded that is not true.
14                 I remind you that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to
15        violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, but that
16        evidence has been permitted to assist you in assessing Mr.
17        Cohen's credibility as a witness and help provide context
18        for some of the other evidence that has been offered.
19                 You may consider that testimony for those purposes
20        only.
21                 Mr. Cohen's plea is not evidence of the
22        defendant's guilt.  You may not consider it in determining
23        whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the
24        charged crimes.
25                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.

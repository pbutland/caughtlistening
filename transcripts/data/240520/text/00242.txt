R. Costello - Direct/Bove

1       inconsistent statement, the law is extraordinarily clear on
2       this.
3                The witness' attention has to be specifically
4       called to the prior inconsistency, and he has to be given a
5       chance to explain it.
6                Only if he maintains the inconsistency or he says
7       he doesn't remember is impeachment by a prior inconsistent

18       and Z on this date, and then Cohen would have had to have
19       denied it; and then it would be permissible.
20                It is not permissible to have a wholesale of
21       everything that Mr. Cohen said --
22                MR. BOVE:  That's not what I'm trying to do,
23       Judge.

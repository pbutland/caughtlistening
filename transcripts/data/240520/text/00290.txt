1   story from the voters criminal?
2            So, it's a false story, and there's a decision
3   made to pay off the person who's spreading the false
4   story. That means that a false story is not being
5   presented to the folks that are voting in New York State.
6            That's not a catch and kill, your Honor,
7   certainly not a criminal catch and kill.
8            As it relates to Ms. Daniels, AMI wanted nothing
9   to do with that. There's lots of testimony about that.
10            When it came to catching and killing, which is
11   supposedly the conspiracy that's going to be entered into
12   between Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump,
13   if that was really the conspiracy, AMI jumped out of that
14   conspiracy.
15            As you heard over the past several weeks,
16   Mr. Pecker was insistent that he wanted nothing to do with
17   any kind of catch and kill with Ms. Daniels.
18            In fact, that led to Mr. Cohen entering into an
19   NDA with her.
20            Mr. Cohen is not a member of the press. He
21   doesn't own the National Enquirer.
22            This isn't a catch and kill story, which is,
23   supposedly, the conspiracy that was formed in
24   October 2016.
25            So, the three separate incidents this jury heard

3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I tell you what I am going to do,
4        I skipped a step.  I am going to offer one more picture
5        which is going to also show again President Trump there on
6        that date and ask if it's a true and accurate
7        representation of how Mr. Schiller and Mr. Trump looked in

21        truth of the photograph for a specific date based upon the
22        paralegal Googling it.
23                 MS. HOFFINGER:  He reviewed the audio tape.  The
24        tape was from C-Span.  There's testimony how it's retrieved
25        and how he reviewed the rally.  These were screen shots.

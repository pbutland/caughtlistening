Proceedings
4289
1 THE COURT: I'll reserve decision.
2 MR. BLANCHE: Briefly, your Honor, the evidence
3 of there being any sort of illegality in this
4 conspiracy —— a conspiracy isn't a conspiracy just because
5 three people get together and talk. There has to be an
6 illegal objective.
7 False filings of AMI records doesn‘t qualify.
8 False records years after the fact, the fact that
9 there was a campaign contribution that Mr. Cohen
10 ultimately pled guilty to, that shouldn't qualify.
11 The evidence that came in this courtroom is
12 really what the Court should consider.
13 You have no evidence of a catch and kill at that
14 meeting; just evidence that —— of what reporters and
15 politicians do every day during every campaign, and the
16 People have turned that into a beginning of a
17 conspiratorial agreement and relationship.
18 But, that's not what the evidence showed over the
19 last several years.
20 At the end of the day —— then I'll sit down ——
21 you have a books and records violation where you have a
22 legal expense. That's the entry that's false, supposedly.
23 And you have testimony, non—contrary, that
24 Mr. Cohen was President Trump's lawyer in 2017.
25 So, it's hard to imagine what book —— how this

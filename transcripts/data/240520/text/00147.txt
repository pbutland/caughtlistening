M. Cohen â€” Redirect/Hoffinger
4138
1 Q. So, what is omitted from in that paragraph that makes
2 it deceptive?
3 A. The fact that it was paid for by Mr. Trump or the Trump
4 Trust.
5 Q. Did you intend for it to be misleading in that way?
6 A. I did.
7 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at Paragraph 3
8 now and highlight a line that says, "The payment in
9 question does not constitute a campaign contribution or
10 expenditure."
11 (Displayed.)
12 Q. Do you see that line?
13 A. I do.
14 Q. When defense counsel was reading that line to you, you
15 said "correct."
16 Let me ask you the question: Is that a truthful
17 sentence?
18 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.
19 THE COURT: Please approach.
20 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebarz)
21 MS. HOFFINGER: So, Mr. Blanche is looking at the
22 transcript. Mr. Blanche read up through that line and he
23 said correct, which I think left a misleading impression,
24 which is, that he was saying that the sentence was correct.
25 I am asking him if that was a truthful statement.

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4102
1       Q    Do you recognize that email?
2       A    I do.
3       Q    That's another email between you and Mr. Costello?
4       A    Yes, sir.
5       Q    Or a chain of emails, right?
6       A    Correct.
7                 MR. BLANCHE:  We offer B-1003.
8                 MS. HOFFINGER:  No objection.
9                 THE COURT:  Accepted.
10                      (Document is received in evidence.)
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  Can we put it on the screen?
12                      (Displayed.)
13                 MR. BLANCHE:  If we can blow up the bottom third
14       of the email, please.
15       Q    This is an email on April 19th from Mr. Costello to
16   you saying, I am sure you saw the news.  Rudy is joining the
17   Trump legal team.  I told you my relationship with Rudy, which
18   would be very well useful -- very, very useful for you and Bob
19   Costello.
20                 MR. BLANCHE:  And then, if we can go to the
21       statement back.
22       Q    This is from you, Mr. Cohen.
23            You say, Robert, great news for Rudy.  I know I owe
24   you a call.  You have been working for lawyers all along and
25   just now coming up for air, correct?

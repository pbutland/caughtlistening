1            However, it is difficult to reconcile how an
2   expert would testify to the very basic topics and, yet,

4   precedent, advisory opinions, agency adjudications, and
5   even the Federal Register to explain how and why the
6   provisions were developed.
7            Clearly, this would virtually all fall under the
8   umbrella of legal opinion.
9            If Mr. Smith is permitted to testify to these
10   subjects, the People would have to be given an opportunity
11   to offer an expert to testify as to these same legal
12   principles, as well.
13            The jury would then hear my instructions on the
14   law, as well as the instructions from two others. As
15   Mr. Colangelo pointed out on Thursday, the jury would hear
16   legal instructions from three different people: the
17   Defense expert, the People's expert, and the Court.

19   question this would result in a battle of the experts,
20   which will only serve to confuse and not assist the jury.
21            Indeed, Mr. Smith has been precluded from
22   testifying about similar matters in the Southern District
23   of New York by Federal District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan
24   in the matter of United States v. Bankman-Fried. There,
25   Judge Kaplan found the testimony was improper precisely

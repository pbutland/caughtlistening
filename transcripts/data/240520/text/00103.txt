1       Q    Yes.  On the telephone?
2       A    Ten.  Maybe, maybe a few more.
3       Q    And those would have been between like, around the time
4   that you had met with him the first time and then whenever you
5   stopped talking to them, a few months later; right?
6       A    Correct.
7       Q    On -- now, after that first meeting, a few days later,
8   on April 23rd, do you remember Mr. Costello calling, following

12       A    Yes, sir.
13       Q    So I want to show you what has been marked for

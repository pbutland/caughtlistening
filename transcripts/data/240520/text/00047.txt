1        his financial problems.
2                 During this time, there is a series of
3        communications we're about to talk to him about, where
4        he's working to get an apartment for him in one of Ivanka
5        Trump's apartments. That's all.
6                 Two questions.
7                 THE COURT:  Do you have to bring up
8        Mr. Freidman's financial troubles?
9                 How does that factor into Mr. Freidman's
10        financial troubles?
11                 MR. BLANCHE:  Because he, eventually, cooperates
12        and testifies against him in the Southern District of New
13        York.
14                 MS. HOFFINGER:  So what?
15                 Are you suggesting Mr. Cohen can't do more than
16        one thing at a time as a lawyer for a company?
17                 THE COURT:  Keep it to three more questions about
18        him being busy.
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  All right.

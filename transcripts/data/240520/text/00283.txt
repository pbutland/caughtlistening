1 THE COURT: I generally do not give that
2 instruction, but you can ask him tomorrow whether he has or
3 has not.
4 (Witness excused.)
5 THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger, you think that you have
6 about a half hour left?
7 I'm not going to rush you.
8 MS. HOFFINGER: Understood, understood. Probably
9 half an hour to 45 minutes at the most.
10 And I may cut some of it tonight, so.
11 THE COURT: Okay. And then I expected you will
12 have some redirect?
13 MR. BOVE: Yes, your Honor.
14 But I don’t expect that it’s going to be long.
15 THE COURT: Okay. And then at this point, do you
16 expect to call any other witnesses?
17 MR. BOVE: Not at this point, Judge.
18 We are going to do some thinking tonight, but,
19 obviously, there are some limitations on that, but not at
20 this point.
21 THE COURT: That can change, but it appears that
22 tomorrow very early in the morning you will rest and I will
23 excuse the jury at that time.
24 All right. Thank you, everyone.
25 MR. BOVE: Judge ——

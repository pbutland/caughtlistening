1 Q So, we ended last Thursday. Since that time until
2 right now, how many reporters have you talked to about what
3 happened last week?
4 A I didn’t speak to reporters about what happened last
5 week.
6 Q You didn’t speak to a single reporter about what
7 happened last week?
8 A I have spoken to reporters who just called to say
9 hello, to see how I’m doing, to check in. But I did not talk
10 about this case.
11 Q So, the reporters you spoke with just greeted you and
12 asked how you were doing, didn’t speak at all about your
13 testimony last week?
14 A Correct.
15 Q Now, you —— prior to your testimony —— let’s focus on
16 2024.
17 So, just since the beginning of this year, you talked to
18 reporters pretty extensively about this case; correct?
19 A I have, yes.
20 Q Again, just focus on this year.
21 Did you —— how many times did you meet with the Prosecutors
22 of this case, again, just this year, in 2024?
23 A More than a dozen.
24 Q More than a dozen.
25 Like, more than 12, but —— 20 times?

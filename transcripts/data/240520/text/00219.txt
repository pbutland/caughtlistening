D. Sitko — Cross/Mangold
4210
1 communicated on the phone, either Mr. Cohen calling
2 Mr. Costello or Mr. Costello was calling Mr. Cohen, up to 75
3 times?
4 A Yes.
5 Q And is that 75 number based on this chart you
6 prepared?
7 A Yes.
8 Q Now, looking at the originating number ——
9 MS. MANGOLD: We can zoom in on the top. Maybe
10 row 12.
11 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
12 MS. MANGOLD: Just for the record, I'll note that
13 I believe what we’ve put up now might be an earlier
14 version of the exhibit that we received without row
15 numbers.
16 Q Mr. Sitko, is that consistent with your understanding?
17 A Yes. I believe so.
18 Q Okay.
19 Do you see where there’s a line that says 0000, DHC, that
20 top row right there from 4—16—2018?
21 A Yes.
22 Q Just below that, with almost the exact same timestamp,
23 I believe —— so, the first call, zero minutes is timestamp
24 under 4:34:26; and the following call, dated the same time, has
25 a timestamp of 4:34:27; right?

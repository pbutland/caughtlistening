1 I believe Mr. Lydon had to do with a mortgage that I had on
2 a piece of real estate in Florida.
3 Q So, if I can show you what’s been marked for
4 identification, just for you and for the parties and the Court,
5 B130.
6 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of
7 the witness and the parties.)
8 MR. BLANCHE: If we can focus on September 28th
9 of 2016.
10 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on
11 his screen.)
12 Q Do you see that text message from someone named Kerry?
13 A I do.
14 Q That’s Mr. Lydon’s wife?
15 A I believe so, yes.
16 Q Do you have any doubt?
17 A I do not.
18 Q So, you see that communication from her, saying, "The
19 New York City medallion portfolio overview as of 8/31," and
20 then there's an attachment, a spreadsheet?
21 A Yes, sir.
22 MR. BLANCHE: We can take that down.
23 Q Do you recall receiving a text a few days later from
24 John, from Kerry’s husband, saying that he wanted to talk to
25 you about that over the weekend?

1        admitted. But, if it is, it should be limited only to
2        those two statements.
3                 MR. BOVE:  We, respectfully, disagree.
4                 This testimony is being offered, in part, to
5        admit prior inconsistent statements through the testimony.
6                 But, more importantly, it's being offered to
7        rebut the Government's theory of a pressure campaign by
8        President Trump in 2018.
9                 We moved prior to trial to preclude that
10        evidence. It came in; we understand.
11                 So, we're offering this as a significant part of
12        our defense, to rebut the suggestion from Mr. Cohen that
13        his interactions with Bob Costello were some kind of way
14        for President Trump to get to him, to apply pressure.
15                 That was the general thrust of his testimony. He
16        said that in specifics. They offered emails about this.
17                 So, Mr. Costello is going to explain his
18        relationship with Michael Cohen, from his perspective, to
19        rebut the Government's theory on this issue.
20                 MS. HOFFINGER:  This is really about Michael
21        Cohen's state of mind. That's the purpose of what you
22        admitted it for, which is why he didn't tell the truth for
23        a very long time.
24                 He said repeatedly he did not tell the truth to
25        Mr. Costello. At no time did he tell him why.

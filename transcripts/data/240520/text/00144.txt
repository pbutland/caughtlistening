5   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
8
6       Q.   And just as a reminder, did Mr. Trump say that he
9
7   wouldn't pay Red Finch for that work that they had done to make
10
8   sure that his name was higher in the polls?
11
9       A.   Yes.
12
10       Q.   Did he say why he wouldn't pay them?
13
11       A.   He did.
14
12       Q.   What was it?
15
13       A.   Because CNBC ended up not continuing and moving forward
16
14   with this poll, and so he didn't feel that he had gotten the
17
15   benefit of what the services were supposed to ultimately
18
16   provide.  And that, of course, was being Number 9.
19
17            CNBC also had the right to some language, that they can
20
18   take anybody out of the poll that they wanted to, and so Mr.
21
19   Trump didn't feel that he got the benefit of what the funds were
22
20   supposed to go to, despite achieving Number 9, and refused to
23
21   make the payment.
24
22       Q.   So, Mr. Cohen, after some period of time, you felt
25   23   pressure to make some payment to your friend, to your colleague?
26   24       A.   Yes.
27   25       Q.   And that's after the bills had been outstanding for

1        M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
2
1                      (Continued from the previous page.)
3
2       Q    The guy that you were in business with -- not in
4
3   business with.
5
4            The guy that you had loaned tax medallions to for many
6
5   years?
7
6       A    I had leased taxi medallions to him.
8
7       Q    Now, if we look at the rest of that email, it looks
9
8   like -- well, what Mr. Costello says to you, is that he thought
10
9   he would have no problem tracking that down, and that he might
11
10   have the answer the night before, but that hasn't happened,
12
11   right?
13
12            So, Mr. Costello is telling you he asked the question
14
13   and he is waiting for an answer back, right?
15
14       A    Correct.
16
15       Q    So, let's look now -- if I can show you what's been
17
16   marked for identification as B-1008.
18
17                 MR. BLANCHE:  Just for the -- just for the
19
18       witness, the parties and the Court.
20
19                      (Displayed.)
21
20       Q    Take a look at that email and tell me whether you
22
21   recognize it?
23
22            Now, while you are looking at it, Mr. Cohen, for
24
23   reasons that they were produced, you will notice that they are
25   24   reversed.
26   25            Does that make sense?

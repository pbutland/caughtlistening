Proceedings
4286
1            People's 81, which is the Defendant's signed and
2   certified Office of Government Ethics Form, which explains
3   in that footnote we pointed to on Page 45 that the
4   Defendant reimbursed Mr. Cohen for expenses he incurred.
5            We've got People's 407G, I believe it was, which
6   was a public statement from the Defendant admitting he
7   reimbursed Mr. Cohen.
8            You have the testimony from Ms. Daniels'
9   transcript, 2903, where she acknowledged from civil
10   litigation in California, the Defendant acknowledged
11   Mr. Cohen had to be reimbursed.
12            The evidence this payment was for reimbursement
13   and not for a retainer for legal services performed is
14   overwhelming; and, at minimum, a rational juror can
15   conclude beyond a reasonable doubt the invoices, the
16   ledger entries, the signed checks with check stubs, all
17   contain false instruments.
18            Mr. Blanche made a couple of arguments regarding
19   intent to defraud. At least one of them touched on the
20   first element in the CJI instruction, whether the
21   Defendant made or caused a false entry in the business of
22   his entries, because Mr. Blanche talked about the
23   accounting staff and the normal operations of the
24   accounting staff.
25            As a matter of law, your Honor, it's sufficient,

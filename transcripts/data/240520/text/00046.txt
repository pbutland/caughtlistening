M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4037
1       Q    Did you, in that time period, help him with respect to
2   his marital problems?
3       A    I tried.
4       Q    What did you try to do?
5       A    I tried to assist in bringing them back together, as
6   well as talking to him about potential lawyers.
7       Q    Did you help him find a place to live?
8       A    Yes, sir.
9       Q    Was that --
10                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, I'm going to object at
11        this point.
12                 THE COURT:  Please approach.
13                 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
14        at sidebar:)
15                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I understand we're going into
16        some areas that he was busy in October.
17                 But, to go into some other person's personal
18        marital issues and whether he assisted him, I don't see
19        how that's relevant.
20                 THE COURT:  Where are you going with this,
21        Mr. Blanche?
22                 MR. BLANCHE:  Mr. Cohen, in October, was
23        dealing with a tremendous number of issues, including
24        Mr. Freidman, who, the Court will recall, very quickly
25        after that gets into a lot of legal trouble coming out of

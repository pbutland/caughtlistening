1 different from what Mr. Cohen testified to last Tuesday
2 and last Thursday.
3 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, Mr. Citron‘s opinion of
4 their efforts to provide him with some comfort is not an
5 impeachment of Mr. Cohen's view of how he felt the meeting
6 went and his views about whether he wanted to retain him.
7 Whether it's impeachment or not, this is still
8 hearsay, so it should not be admissible.
9 Again —— this is opinion, also. This is a
10 lawyer's opinion, pitching a client, saying: We would like
11 to give you some comfort; allow me to give you some
12 comfort.
13 This doesn't disclose what's in Michael Cohen's
14 mind and how he felt about the meeting and how he felt
15 about retaining or not retaining the firm.
16 MR. BLANCHE: It's to Mr. Cohen.
17 This isn't an email amongst partners talking
18 about something.
19 This is an email to Mr. Cohen.
20 THE COURT: Expressing Mr. Citron's opinion.
21 MR. BLANCHE: To Mr. Cohen.
22 There's a lot of emails admitted, including by
23 the People directly, of views of the person.
24 THE COURT: There's another layer of hearsay
25 here. It wasn't sent by Mr. Citron. It was sent by Diana

Proceedings

1 Obviously, we all want to get it right.
2 I agree with that.
3 Are you thinking about the charge conference
4 tomorrow, or are you thinking about the charge conference
5 this afternoon?
6 Does it depend on when the testimony ends?
7 THE COURT: It depends.
8 If the testimony ends sometime today, I think we
9 can have the charge conference tomorrow afternoon, so we
10 can all prepare for it.
11 I think I definitely want to have it before
12 Thursday.
13 MR. STEINGLASS: I totally agree.
14 Tomorrow, at the latest, would be perfect.
15 THE COURT: We'll shoot for tomorrow afternoon.

M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche
4082
l O Well, let me ask you this: There is nothing wrong with
2 you and/or another party signing an agreement and then saying,
3 we are not going to work together anymore; right?
4 A That's correct.
5 Q By the way, you never told President Trump that you
6 had —— and we are going to go through some more that you had ——
7 had all these consulting arrangements; did you?
8 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.
9 THE COURT: Overruled.
10 You can answer.
11 A In fact, it was Mr. Trump who introduced the CEO of
12 AT&T to me, that's how I ended up obtaining him as a client.
13 Q So, let me ask that question again. I didn't ask you
14 who introduced you to your clients.
15 My question was whether along the way you told President
16 Trump that you had all these —— that you had six consulting
17 Agreements ——
18 A I did not specifically tell President Trump that, no.
19 Q And —— well, you know at some point he found out;
20 right?
21 A I believe so, yes.
22 Q And you know that he was frustrated that you had signed
23 a deal with AT&T; correct?
24 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
25 THE COURT: Sustained.

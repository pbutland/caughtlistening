R. Costello - Cross/Hoffinger
4270
1       Q    And did you tell the Grand Jury that you didn't know
2   whether he was being a drama queen or not?
3       A    Yeah, and that's because --
4       Q    Did you tell --
5       A    And that's because --
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Well, I'm asking for the witness
7        to answer the question, your Honor.
8                THE COURT:  Sir, if you are able to answer the
9       question yes or no, please answer yes or no.
10                If you are not able to, just let Ms. Hoffinger know
11       and she will rephrase it.
12       A    Do you want me to answer that question yes or no?
13       Q    Sure.
14       Did you tell the Grand Jury that he was acting like a drama
15   queen?
16       A    No.  I said I didn't know whether he was acting as a
17   drama queen, right --
18       Q    Well, you don't like drama queens; right?
19       A    I just didn't know, because I didn't know the guy.
20       I couldn't assess whether these actions by him were genuine
21   or not, but my partner thought they were, and he knew him for
22   ten years.
23       Q    So, Michael Cohen ultimately chose a different lawyer
24   to represent him; right?
25       Not you; is that correct?

M. Cohen — Redirect/Hoffinger
4179
1 MR. BLANCHE: Very much so.
2 THE COURT: What is the prejudice?
3 MR. BLANCHE: The prejudice is the sequence of
4 events. The People rest or we take witnesses out of turn
5 just because we happen to have witnesses here.
6 To allow for the People to try to get a witness
7 here by tomorrow morning to testify about something that
8 there was testimony about last week, your Honor —— and I
9 accept that this fact wasn't learned until over the
10 weekend, but the call was made, apparently, over lunch to
11 see if the witness can come out.
12 This isn't a new fact. Presumably, the People
13 prepped Mr. Cohen on this phone call.
14 And I don't —— this is patently unfair in our view
15 for the Court to allow the People, given an obvious ruling
16 on the admissibility of a picture —— of a picture on
17 redirect, to allow them to stop, to presumably rest or not
18 rest, make us decide if we want to put on a case before
19 they rested for no reason.
20 THE COURT: I am not going to make you put on your
21 case before they rest. What I could do is simply adjourn
22 until tomorrow.
23 MR. BLANCHE: There have been multiple days where
24 we had to end early because the People are out of
25 witnesses. There has been scheduling issues. That happens

1        presumably, within a few minutes of the People resting the
2        case.
3                 We have witnesses here.  There is a likelihood
4        that we will rest today.
5                 So, the People have known about this issue.  Well,
6        I don't know how long they have known about this issue, but
7        certainly as of last Thursday it was something that was
8        elicited on cross-examination before lunch.
9                 So, here we are on Monday, and they're about to
10        rest and they're asking, I guess, for an opportunity to see
11        if this witness can come back.
12                 We very much object.  We    have a witness in the
13        back, that depending on how the rest of the cross goes, and
14        assuming we call the witness, we have another short
15        witness.  We anticipate resting as well.  At least as of
16        now.
17                 We would object and ask that the Court not allow
18        the trial to just go on.
19                 THE COURT:  People, why wasn't this taken care of
20        sooner?
21                 MR. STEINGLASS:  Well, Judge, we learned of this
22        over the weekend and have been making diligent efforts to
23        move forward on this.
24                 Frankly, we thought that the -- I understand your
25        Honor's ruling.

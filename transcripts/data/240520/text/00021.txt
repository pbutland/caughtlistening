1   right now what my charge is going to be without hearing
2   from both sides what the recommendations are.
3            MR. BOVE:  I understand, Judge.
4            What has changed, the reason that we didn't come
5   to you, say, at the February hearing on this is because at
6   that point in the Government's theory of the case, FECA
7   was still a 175.10 predicate on our understanding.
8            I think that's the way that your Honor described
9   it in the Omnibus rulings.
10            From what -- from our perspective -- I understand
11   what you're saying.
12            From our perspective, what is new is FECA is now
13   buried under the New York Election Law predicate.
14            What makes that difficult, we submit, is that the
15   Government has to establish there was intent -- intent to
16   defraud and intent to conceal a crime.
17            That New York Election Law charge is only a crime
18   if people who were part of that conspiracy, there was an
19   agreement, and it had to be to violate the law.
20            So, there is no 175.10 predicate -- this is our
21   argument -- unless there's a FECA violation or -- I know
22   about the tax and the business records charge. We'll talk
23   about that at the charge conference and when we talk about
24   the sufficiency of the Government's case.
25            But, the way it's structured now -- we did,

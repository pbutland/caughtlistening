D. Sitko - Cross/Mangold
4212
1       Q    And I believe your paralegal testified that these are
2   made from how the call bounces off of AT&T towers?
3       A    Yes.
4       Q    That's how the records are displayed in AT&T records?
5       A    Yes.
6       Q    But, there are 75 rows in the chart; right?
7       A    Yes.
8       Q    So, are all of those 75 rows separate times that
9   Mr. Cohen's number connected with Mr. Costello's number?
10       Is your understanding there was an actual conversation, or
11   could it be a missed call, a voicemail, or an actual connection
12   between the two?
13       A    Yeah. So if Mr. Cohen and Mr. Costello had made a push
14   call, it could be reflected in two different lines on this for
15   the same call.
16       Q    So, the total number of conversations, that was less
17   than 75?
18       A    Conversations, yes. Certainly.
19                 MS. MANGOLD:  I have no further questions.
20                 THE COURT:  Anything further?
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  No redirect.
22                 THE COURT:  Thank you.
23                 You can step down.
24                 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)
25                 THE COURT:  Your next witness, please.

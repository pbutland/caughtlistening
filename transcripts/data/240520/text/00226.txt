1 the witness’ answer on those matters that affect solely
2 credibility.
3 To the extent that defense is offering statements
4 by Mr. Costello as prior inconsistent statements of
5 Mr. Cohen, then we would say if his testimony is admitted,
6 which we believe it should not be, if it’s admitted, it
7 needs to be limited and restricted only to those prior
8 inconsistent statements.
9 They’re not entitled to elicit from Mr. Costello
10 his opinions about Mr. Cohen’s credibility.
11 They should be restricted just to the two
12 questions, frankly, that Mr. Cohen testified that he
13 didn’t recall. All he said was that he didn’t recall.
14 He didn’t recall Mr. Costello telling him in the
15 first meeting that he could or should cooperate against
16 President Trump.
17 He didn't recall —— he didn’t recall the words,
18 saying that he didn’t —— that he said to Mr. Costello he
19 had nothing on President Trump.
20 But, you will recall that he testified several
21 times that he did not tell the truth to Mr. Costello.
22 He absolutely did not tell the truth. He knew it
23 would get back to Mr. Trump through Mr. Giuliani.
24 So, I think there’s very little testimony that
25 would be permissible, if at all.

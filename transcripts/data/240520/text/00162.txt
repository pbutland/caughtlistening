1 Q. Now, you were asked some questions about Mr. Costello;
2 do you remember that?
3 A. Yes, ma'am.
4 Q. Did you ever sign a Retainer Agreement with him?
5 A. No, ma'am.
6 Q. Why not?
7 A. I didn't trust him. I didn't like the way that he kept

ll Q. And did you ever agree to pay him anything?
12 A. No, ma'am.
13 Q. Is that why you didn't sign the Retainer Agreement
14 also?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Now, in February of 2019, did you speak to some
17 prosecutors at the Southern District about Mr. Costello?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. Did they have some questions for you about him?
20 A. They did.
21 Q. And in order to answer those questions, did you sign a
22 Waiver Agreement with respect to Mr. Costello so you could
23 answer those questions?
24 A. Yes, ma'am.

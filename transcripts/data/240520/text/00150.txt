4141
1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Line 17 on 3963.
2                 "QUESTION:  And that it doesn't constitute a
3        campaign contribution or expenditure, and therefore the FEC
4        lacks jurisdiction over the matter?"
5                 THE COURT:  What page is that?
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  3963.
7                 MR. BLANCHE:  3963.
8                 MS. HOFFINGER:  If you want to look at it, I could
9        hand it to you.  It's underlined there, 3963, line 17.
10                 MR. BLANCHE:  I am asking if it's true.
11                 THE COURT:  On 3963, beginning on line 17.
12                 "And that it doesn't constitute a campaign
13        contribution or expenditure and therefore the FEC lacks
14        jurisdiction over the matter?"
15                 "ANSWER:  Correct."
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  I was reading that it's correct,
17        that the letter says that.
18                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Exactly.
19                 THE COURT:  The People will have an opportunity to
20        clean that up.
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Thank you.
22                 I thought you made your ruling, which is why I
23        left.
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  Depending on the answer, we would
25        ask for an instruction again.

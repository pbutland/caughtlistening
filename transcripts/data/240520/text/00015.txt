Proceedings
4006
1            To be clear, our instructions we submitted last
2   week do include instructions related to the terms at
3   issue, "For the purpose of influencing a Federal election"
4   and "Irrespective Rule", especially because the
5   "influencing" conduct is part of the texts of
6   "contribution" and "expenditure", as the Court knows.
7            The tough spot that we're in right now, I think,
8   is that your Honor has not indicated a firm intention to
9   instruct the jury on FECA. And so, we're in a place where
10   we're -- we understand the Court's ruling.
11            You have our position.
12            We're restricted in what Mr. Smith could say.
13            And, frankly, Mr. Smith reading the texts of
14   those statutory definitions is not going to help the jury
15   grapple with the issues that these charges present and
16   that the Government, from their new theory of this case,
17   presents.
18            I know it's not the best position, for a lawyer
19   to be asking questions to the Court. It usually goes in
20   the other direction. I understand that.
21            But, we are trying to make decisions about our
22   defense, how to present it. It impacts closings and the
23   charge conference.
24            I am wondering if you are willing to give us any
25   sense on the way you're leaning, if you're going to

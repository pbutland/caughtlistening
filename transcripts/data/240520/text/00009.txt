1 additional points that we want to raise about the charge,
2 but we can wait until we have the preâ€”charge conference if
3 that's preferable. They're minor points.
4 THE COURT: Actually, let me go through this
5 first, and then we'll decide if we can take that up.
6 On Thursday, May 16th, the Defense made an
7 application to this Court regarding the scope of
8 permissible testimony from their expert, Brad Smith, who
9 the Defense intends to call to testify regarding Campaign
10 Finance Law. Defendant pointed to this Court's decisions
11 on Motions in Limine and, in particular, to this Court's
12 ruling that the expert could testify as to general
13 definitions and terms that relate directly to the case,
14 such as, for example: campaign contribution, relative
15 individual campaign contribution limits, expenditure, and
16 coordinated expenditure.
17 Defendant specifically requested permission to
18 elicit testimony from Mr. Smith about the three separate
19 terms.
20 First, the term, "For the purpose of influencing
21 an election for Federal office."
22 As I understand it, in order to define this term,
23 the expert would rely upon legal precedent, including the
24 Supreme Court's decision in Buckley and the D.C. Circuit's
25 decision in Orloski.

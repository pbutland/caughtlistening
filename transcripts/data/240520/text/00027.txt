Proceedings
1 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were
2 preceded by a sealed discussion at sidebar.)
3 (Whereupon, the following proceedings are held at
4 sidebarz)
5 MR. BLANCHE: So, as it stands right now, we
6 have, potentially, Mr. Smith; potentially, Mr. Costello;
7 and then our paralegal to put in one phone chart, which is
8 very quick.
9 We, obviously, need to think about Mr. Smith.
10 Honestly, we're going to think about
11 Mr. Costello, depending how this morning goes.
12 There's still a lot up in the air.
13 That's where we're at.
14 THE COURT: Okay.
15 Do you think this changes things at all as far as
16 the scheduling, or are we still on the same track?
17 MR. BLANCHE: I'll let everybody speak.
18 I think the problems you identified yesterday
19 remain, no matter who testifies or who does not testify
20 today, because even if we're finished and everybody rests
21 by the afternoon today, we're still on a tight schedule to
22 have a full charge conference with complicated issues,
23 have your Honor make a decision, tell us what the decision
24 is going to be, sum up tomorrow —— I don't need to restate
25 the same things —— spill over to Thursday. You may charge

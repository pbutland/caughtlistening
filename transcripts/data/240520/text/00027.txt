6
5                  MR. BLANCHE:  So, as it stands right now, we
7
6         have, potentially, Mr. Smith; potentially, Mr. Costello;
8
7         and then our paralegal to put in one phone chart, which is
9
8         very quick.
10
9                  We, obviously, need to think about Mr. Smith.
11
10                  Honestly, we're going to think about
12
11         Mr. Costello, depending how this morning goes.
13
12                  There's still a lot up in the air.
14
13                  That's where we're at.
15
14                  THE COURT:  Okay.
16
15                  Do you think this changes things at all as far as
17
16         the scheduling, or are we still on the same track?
18
17                  MR. BLANCHE:  I'll let everybody speak.
19
18                  I think the problems you identified yesterday
20
19         remain, no matter who testifies or who does not testify
21
20         today, because even if we're finished and everybody rests
22
21         by the afternoon today, we're still on a tight schedule to
23
22         have a full charge conference with complicated issues,
24
23         have your Honor make a decision, tell us what the decision
25   24         is going to be, sum up tomorrow -- I don't need to restate
26   25         the same things -- spill over to Thursday.  You may charge

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4035
1       Q    What do you mean by that?
2       A    Mr. Freidman was a licensed New York City medallion
3   agent, and he was running my medallions, both in New York as
4   well as some in Chicago.
5       Q    So, the spreadsheet that Mr. Lydon sent to you that
6   went to October, that doesn't refresh your recollection whether
7   Mr. Freidman was part of that deal?
8       A    No, sir.
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  You can take that down.
10       Q    We can show you B144, which is an October 14th email.
11                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of
12        the witness and the parties.)
13       Q    Take a look at that.
14       Take your time reading it, and see if that refreshes your
15   recollection about whether Mr. Freidman was part of that deal.
16                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, Judge, just as to
17        characterizing the testimony.
18                 THE COURT:  Let's see if it refreshes his
19        recollection.
20                 (Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on
21        his screen.)
22       A    Sir.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  You can take that down.
24       Q    Does that refresh your recollection about who is the
25   funder that you were interested in getting for that deal?

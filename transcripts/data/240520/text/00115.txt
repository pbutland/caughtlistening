3       Q    So, this is Mr. Costello's email to you on June 28th
4   in response to what looks like a question from you, is that
5   right, Mr. Cohen?
6       A    Yes, sir.
7       Q    And what you wrote is, or what he writes to you is,
8   the answer about why they haven't brought an action challenging
9   Mueller, his investigation, and the Michael Cohen referral and
10   investigation based upon the findings of the IG Horowitz
11   Report.
12            Do you see that right?
13       A    I do.
14       Q    So, he was answering a question that you had asked
15   about what was going on in DC about the Mueller case and your
16   investigation, correct?
17       A    Correct.
18       Q    And is that --
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  We can take that down.
20       Q    Mr. Cohen, is that consistent with your memory of the
21   types of things you were talking about with Mr. Costello at
22   that time?
23       A    Yes.
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  Now, can you also put that same
25       Exhibit back up, again, please?

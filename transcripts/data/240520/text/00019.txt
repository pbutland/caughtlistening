Proceedings

1 there's one point that I want to make. This is a
2 fundamentally different charging structure than what
3 happened at the prior trial.
4 At the prior trial, I think the predicates were
5 really substantive charges, and the jury got a sense of
6 that.
7 THE COURT: Forgive me for interrupting you.
8 How they structured it in their proposal at this
9 moment carries no weight. The Court could very well decide
10 I agree with you a hundred percent, that the way that they
11 presented it is not appropriate.
12 I'm not sure that I agree with you that there's a
13 change in theory.
14 But, I do see what you're talking about when
15 you're talking as to structure in their proposed charges.
16 MR. BOVE: My point is, what makes this case
17 different, then, is that the predicate for the 175.10
18 charge, this New York Election Law conspiracy, that
19 conspiracy to influence the election, to promote a
20 candidate, the statutory language is: "only unlawful if
21 there is unlawful activity."
22 And so, otherwise, it's just an agreement to try
23 to win an election.
24 That's why I think that statute has not been
25 applied very many times.

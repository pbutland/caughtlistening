1   you?
2       A    No, I didn't know Michael Cohen.  I had never met him
3   before in my life.
4       And he was putting on quite a show, and I didn't know when
5   he initially said --
6       Q    Sir.
7       A    I was --
8       Q    Sir.
9       A    I'm answering your question.
10                MR. BOVE:  The witness needs to be allowed to
11       finish his answer.
12                THE COURT:  Surely.
13                He can finish his answer.
14       A    (Continuing.)  He was putting on quite a show.
15       And he explained to us -- he told us that two nights before
16   he was on the roof of the Regency Hotel and he was going to jump
17   off and kill himself because he couldn't handle the pressure of
18   what he saw as the ongoing criminal case coming his way.
19       Q    Sure.
20       And you remember testifying in the Grand Jury in this case,
21   sir?
22       A    Yes, I do.
23       Q    And you remember that it was in March, on March 20th of
24   2023?
25       A    Approximately, yeah.

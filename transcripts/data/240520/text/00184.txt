1 I also do agree that certainly the proffered
2 evidence is relevant.
3 However, I don't see how the People can get past
4 the hearsay objection. The testimony that was offered by
5 Dr. Browning was a foundation. One, he's highly qualified,
6 and gave foundation for the exhibits that we were going to
7 be accepting, to whom those exhibits were going to be
8 introduced. He didn't lay the general foundation for any
9 and all videos. This goes for some videos that came in
10 through him.
11 To suggest that a paralegal or anybody else can
12 now take the stand and based upon Dr. Browning's testimony
13 state that they are now qualified to testify as a records
14 custodian and authenticate the video would mean to suggest
15 whoever was here when Dr. Browning testified would be
16 equally qualified do the same.
17 I don't think we can say that.
18 So the objection is sustained. Those images are
19 not going to come in as offered.
20 Anything else?
21 MR. STEINGLASS: We accept your ruling, but I
22 think that may mean that we want to bring the C—Span rep
23 back so he could confirm the business records status of
24 that video. So we're making arrangements to try to do
25 that.

14       It says, "I will be on the team."
15       That was Michael Cohen's phraseology.
16       Quote.  "It would be an honor to have you as part of my
17   team.  I will be eternally grateful for the help and guidance
18   you have already given me."
19       That's a quote from Michael Cohen.
20       Q    If you would just, just read the email, please, from
21   your son?
22       A    That's what it says, it says -- it's in quotes and it
23   says, "Michael Cohen, Personal Attorney to Donald J. Trump."
24       I did read it.
25       Q    Okay.

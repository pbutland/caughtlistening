M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4119
1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Judge, may we approach?
2                 THE COURT:  Sure.
3                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
4                 record.)
5                 MS. HOFFINGER:  They are straying now, again,
6       into advice of counsel, presence of counsel.
7                 THE COURT:  Where are you going with this, Mr.
8       Blanche?
9                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, there is, putting aside the
10       advice of counsel defense, which we are not making, never
11       made and never claimed we were going to make, he was his
12       lawyer.  There is nothing, in my view, wrong with me asking
13       questions about the trust and counsel that they had, not

16                 Where are you going with it?
17                 What is the context?
18                 MR. BLANCHE:  I mean, in summation I anticipate
19       arguing that one of the reasons he should be --
20                 THE COURT:  What is it --
21                 MR. BLANCHE:  One of the reasons his testimony
22       should be rejected is the breach of trust he engaged in.  I
23       have a right to establish --
24                 THE COURT:  You made that out.
25                 You can leave it.  You made that out.

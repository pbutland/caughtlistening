M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4183
1                 The parties have agreed that People's Exhibit 417B
2        is a still photograph taken from the end of the video
3        which concluded at 7:57 p.m. on October 24, 2016.
4                 And we'll just have to ask one more foundational
5        question about whether it's a fair and accurate depiction
6        of the way Mr. Schiller appeared in October.
7                 Then we'll put the exhibit in through Mr. Cohen
8        and we'll read the stipulation, and then the exhibit won't
9        be coming in for the timestamp on the exhibit, but the
10        stipulation will cover that.
11                 THE COURT:  Mr. Blanche, you consent to that?
12                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
13                 THE COURT:  I understand it's a strategic
14        decision.
15                 Have you discussed this with your client?
16                 MR. BLANCHE:  Yes.
17                 MR. STEINGLASS:  So maybe we will read the
18        stipulation after we move it into evidence, after we move
19        the exhibit into evidence.
20                 THE COURT:  That's fine.
21                 Let's get the witness, please.
22                 (Witness entering courtroom.)
23                 ***
24                 (Jury entering courtroom.)

M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4069
1       A    Yes, sir.
2       Q    You had a matter with Marc Kasowitz representing
3   President Trump; right?
4       A    Yes, sir.
5       Q    You were -- you and he were actually lead counsel on
6   that case; right?
7       A    I think Marc Kasowitz was lead counsel.
8       Q    Well, let's take a look at B176 just for you, the Court
9   and the parties.
10                 MR. BLANCHE:  And then we can go to the next
11        page.
12                (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.)
13                MR. BLANCHE:  Actually, let's go to Page 15.  I'm
14       sorry.
15                (Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.)
16       Q    Take a look at Page 15, and, actually, the bottom.
17   Hold on one second.
18       A    Yes, sir.
19       Q    So, isn't it true, that both you and Mr. Kasowitz were
20   both lead counsel on that matter?
21       A    Yes, sir.
22       Q    And that was, at the time, a relatively active matter
23   that was taking a fair amount of your time, and it looks like
24   Mr. Kasowitz's time; right?
25       A    Yes.

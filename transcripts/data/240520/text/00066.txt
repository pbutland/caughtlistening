M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche
4057
1 A Correct.
2 Q I want to show you —— let me ask you this. Except for
3 that one conversation with Mr. Weisselberg about that, and then
4 you guys go in and talk to President Trump about it, supposedly,
5 right, do you remember that, except for those two conversations,
6 did you have other conversations before that with
7 Mr. Weisselberg about your role as President Trump's Personal
8 Attorney?
9 A No, sir.
10 Q So, the conversations you had with Mr. Weisselberg
11 about the Retainer Agreement and that there would be no Retainer
12 Agreement were all in that meeting?
13 That meeting —— I'm sorry, that was a terrible question.
14 So, the conversations that you had with Mr. Weisselberg
15 about the Retainer Agreement and the fact that there would not
16 be one all took place in the meeting you had with him alone and
17 the meeting you had with President Trump; is that your
18 testimony?
19 A Yes, sir.
20 Q And, now, if you would have had a Retainer Agreement,
21 that Agreement would have been between you and your client;
22 right?
23 A Correct.
24 Q And who would your client have been?
25 A It would have been Mr. Trump.

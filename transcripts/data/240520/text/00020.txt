1 There is a —— the charges in this case require a
2 showing of a predicate; and then for that, on the
3 Government's theory today, as of the proposed
4 instructions, there is a —— there has to be a predicate of
5 the predicate.
6 THE COURT: All right.
7 Just to clarify, when you refer to being in a
8 difficult position, I want to be clear, the Court has not
9 changed its position from day one. My decision on the
10 Omnibus Decision remains the same. My decisions on the
11 Motions in Limine remains the same. I offered guidance in
12 those motions. And, therefore, you've known for months ——
13 this is not new —— you've known for months what my
14 position would be.
15 If you had concerns about these specific topics
16 and you wanted an earlier ruling, you could have come to
17 me —— just relax.
18 You could have come to me for an earlier ruling
19 some time ago. But you didn't. And now, you‘ve waited
20 until the People are basically done with their direct
21 case, their case in chief.
22 You're asking me for further guidance, but that's
23 precisely why we have a pre—charge conference, so that you
24 know exactly what you can use on summations.
25 It would be inappropriate for me to tell you

1       Q    Steven Croman was a mutual friend of the two of yours;
2   is that right?
3       A    I went to college with Steve Croman and continue to
4   this day to be friends.
5       Q    And so, you and Mr. Croman went to -- I'm sorry, you

7   in New York City?
8       A    Yes, sir.

11   right?
12       A    I'm sorry, one more time, please.
13       Q    When you went to visit him in jail, it was right after

20       A    I don't recall specifically saying that, but it would
21   have been what I would have said at that time, yes, sir.
22       Q    And, do you remember saying that you had made the deal
23   and President Trump did not know?

M. Cohen - Recross/Blanche
4199
1   got a $50,000 bonus; correct?
2       A    Correct.
3       Q    So, that's $425,000; right?
4       A    Correct, sir.
5       Q    In 2017, you were paid $420,000; correct?
6       A    Correct.
7       Q    35,000 a month; correct?
8       A    Yes, sir.
9       Q    And I know that you were saying that that was just a
10   repayment, but during that time, to be clear, you were
11   President Trump's Personal Attorney the entire year of 2017;
12   correct?
13       A    Correct.
14       Q    Now -- but your testimony is that the $420,000, the
15   $35,000 per month retainer or payment that you received was not
16   for your legal services; it was to pay back the money that
17   President Trump owed you; right?
18       A    Yes. I've classified it as a reimbursement.
19       Q    It was a reimbursement? It wasn't a payment for your
20   services?
21       A    Correct.
22       Q    So, in all, you worked for President Trump, I believe
23   you said, for around 11 years; correct?
24       A    Correct.
25       Q    Did he overpay for things regularly?

Proceedings
3993
1 testimony, preâ€”charge conferences this week, so that we
2 can have summations first thing Tuesday, without a break,
3 and then we can have the charge and begin deliberations.
4 It was either have a long break now or have a
5 long break then.
6 And, unfortunately, the calendar is what it is.
7 So, let's begin with the issue that you brought
8 to my attention regarding Defense Exhibits.
9 MS. HOFFINGER: Good morning, your Honor.
10 Initially, Mr. Blanche had provided us 17
11 exhibits to which we had a number of objections.
12 He has since then pared them back.
13 We have objections now only to two.
14 We just worked out this morning with Mr. Blanche
15 a redaction to one, which had embedded hearsay, which we
16 had an objection to.
17 Now we have just one exhibit we have an objection
18 to, which we believe is hearsay. Defense Exhibit B1005.
19 1 can hand it up.
20 (Whereupon, an exhibit is given to the Court.)
21 MS. HOFFINGER: This is entirely hearsay, your
22 Honor. It's a third person reporting in an email about
23 what Mr. Costello said in a meeting.
24 So, certainly, if Mr. Costello testifies, he can
25 testify to the substance of the meeting.

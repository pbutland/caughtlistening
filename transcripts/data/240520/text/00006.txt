1 Porcello on behalf of Mr. Citron. There's another layer of
2 hearsay.
3 At this point, at this moment, I'm not going to
4 allow it in.
5 It expresses the opinion, arguably, of Mr. Citron
6 or Mr. Costello.
7 It doesn't express the opinion of Mr. Cohen.
8 I don't think you can impeach him on this.
9 MR. BLANCHE: The People offered several exhibits
10 that were emails to Mr. Cohen like this one that expressed
11 some sort of opinion by the author; right. Meaning, the
12 author is saying to Mr. Cohen: We met, or, here's what I
13 did after what you directed me to do.
14 Those all come in.
15 Of course, whether those are the truth depends
16 on —— whether Mr. Cohen believes that's a truthful
17 statement depends on his answer or on what he wrote in
18 response to such an email, potentially; right.
19 The fact that there isn't a response to this
20 email and the fact that he will be allowed to say whether
21 this is true or not is consistent with the other emails
22 that have already been admitted around this relationship.
23 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, 1 just don‘t see it.
24 In other words, he's going to opine on whether
25 they had a View as a firm, whether they could pitch work

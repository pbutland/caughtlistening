1   adds significance for the need for this jury to understand
2   what FECA obligated people to do and did not obligate
3   people to do.
4            We're not seeking to offer testimony from
5   Mr. Smith like the testimony from Suarez you referenced,
6   that the law is confused and -- that's not what we want to
7   do.
8            Fundamentally, our issue and our concern right
9   now is that these two -- it's the phrases at issue, For
10   "the purpose of influencing election" --
11            THE COURT:  Why don't we do this. I'd like to
12   give them a chance, as well.  Give me an offer of proof
13   what he would say. Tell me what he would say in response
14   to those questions, and I'd be in a better position to
15   determine whether it's an appropriate response or not.
16            Let me hear from the People.
17            MR. COLANGELO:  Three quick points.
18            First, to respond to the argument that any aspect
19   of the People's Election Law violation theory is new, we
20   briefed this quite explicitly in Opposition to the
21   Defendant's Omnibus Motion, which we filed November 9th of
22   last year. In that Opposition, I'm looking at Page 25, we
23   identified violations of FECA as among the unlawful
24   means -- that's a part of the Election Law violation.
25            We specifically said: The evidence is sufficient

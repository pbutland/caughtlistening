1 rally took place that day, and they were perfectly
2 comfortable asking a dozen questions or so, to lay a proper
3 business foundation.
4 And so now they say, well, we laid the proper
5 business for the exhibits that were offered a few weeks
6 ago, we don't want to do that again, we're going to have a
7 paralegal come and say they Googled it. That's an
8 exception to the hearsay rule. That's not the rules.
9 THE COURT: Didn't the witness from C—Span lay the
10 foundation?
11 Didn't that witness testify to the functions and
12 how they maintained the records and the liability, and how
13 long they were doing it? Didn't he lay the foundation for
14 how they were maintained.
15 MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely. They were kept in the
16 archives. When he got the subpoena, he went to the
17 archives and pulled the documents and confirmed they were
18 accurate, which is what the rules require.
19 It seems like it's neither here nor there. We all
20 have Googled. The rules of evidence have to apply. You
21 still have to establish a foundation that isn't met here.
22 Especially when one of these is not a picture of Mr.
23 Schiller. One of them is. And the one that is, again, the
24 only thing —— the only relevance at all about this is,
25 again, the date and the time.

1 know a couple of days ago he might.
2 That’s direct, not impeachment.
3 The question is whether he’s allowed for prior
4 inconsistent statements.
5 I suggest anything else, Retainer Agreements,
6 whether he paid him, or anything else that’s lateral and
7 collateral, he shouldn’t be testifying to that.
8 If it’s a prior inconsistent statement, his
9 attention should be drawn to the exact statement, and his
10 testimony should be limited to that.
11 MR. BOVE: Part of what Mr. Costello is going to
12 do is explain that certain things that Cohen testified
13 about at this trial were false. Things like Cohen’s
14 testimony that there was never an agreement, even verbal,
15 that Mr. Costello would represent him.
16 Things like that, where Mr. Costello is providing
17 direct evidence of perjury at this trial, are never
18 collateral, Judge.
19 That’s what we're seeking to lay out.
20 MS. HOFFINGER: It’s entirely collateral, your
21 Honor.
22 MR. BOVE: That he committed perjury is
23 collateral?
24 THE COURT: I’m going to take five minutes.
25 Don’t leave the courtroom.

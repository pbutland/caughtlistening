2 MR. BLANCHE: I just have a scheduling question.
3 Assuming we'll finish by 10—ish, 10:15—ish, are
4 we going to go right to the charge conference, or in the
5 afternoon?
6 THE COURT: What's your preference?
7 MR. BLANCHE: Emil is arguing it.
8 MR. STEINGLASS: He's behind you.
9 (Whereupon, Defense Counsel confer.)
10 MR. BOVE: Whenever it's convenient.
11 THE COURT: I think that we should take at least
12 a short break so that we can all properly prepare for the
13 pre—charge conference.
14 Unless there's a strong objection, 1 would
15 actually like to come back at 2:15 and do it in the
16 afternoon.
17 MR. COLANGELO: No objection here.
18 We were just conferring on the exchange of
19 proposed language your Honor was requesting this morning.
20 We haven't had an opportunity yet to exchange
21 that proposed language. The additional time will give us
22 a chance to do that.
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 (Whereupon, the case is adjourned to May 21,
25 2024.)

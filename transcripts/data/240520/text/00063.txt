1   transaction?
2       A    The transaction with Red Finch had gone on, as I
3   stated, for a long time prior.
4       He knew of the $50,000 that was owed to Red Finch.
5       And when we were sitting down and making the calculations,
6   that's when he asked me:  It's 50,000 for Red Finch?
7       And I said:  Yes.
8       Q    You didn't just say, "Yes;" you actually wrote "50,000"
9   on that sheet of paper; right?
10       A    Yes.
11       Q    So, my question before you gave us that answer was --
12   was a very simple question:
13       In the middle of this conversation that you are having with
14   Mr. Weisselberg and you are figuring out when to -- how to cover
15   up this $130,000 payment, right, you lied to him about how much
16   you owed, you need reimbursement for Red Finch?
17       A    Correct.
18       Q    And to this day, you've never fixed that; right?
19       A    No, sir.
20       Q    And you've talked about that incident on multiple
21   occasions with the District Attorney?
22       A    I have.
23       Q    And, moreover, when you had testified last week, on
24   Tuesday, about what you just said, you didn't say you stole from
25   The Trump Organization; did you?

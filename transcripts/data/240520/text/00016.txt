1   instruct the jury on the FECA issues. If that's the case,
2   that would be helpful for us to understand, because,
3   obviously, we would come to the pre-charge conference,
4   both sides, armed up with authorities and the authorities
5   they cited. From our cite, they would sound like whatever
6   in our best world Mr. Smith would say to the jury. And we
7   would, ultimately, resolve that at the charge conference.
8            The issue for us, what would be helpful in terms
9   of clarity is anything you can give us is the Court's
10   intention on instructing the jury on these issues.
11            I think it's undisputed among the parties that
12   it's appropriate the way the Government constructed the
13   predicate and the underlying activity.
14            THE COURT:  I think at this point, beyond -- as
15   you already referred to the way I instructed the jury in
16   the People v. The Trump Organization, I can tell you, when
17   it comes to these types of matters, I often think that
18   less is better.
19            I think that is -- you must remember, the People
20   are not required to prove these offenses beyond a
21   reasonable doubt; therefore, that reduces the need or the
22   burden to define every term and every phrase.
23            The problem that you have, as I see it, is that
24   your client can't testify to these definitions without
25   invoking the law.

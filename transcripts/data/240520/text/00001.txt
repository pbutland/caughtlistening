1            THE CLERK:  Calling the People of the State of
2   New York versus Donald J. Trump, Indictment 71543/23.
3            Appearances, please, starting with the People.
4            MR. STEINGLASS:  For the People, ADAs Joshua
5   Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Becky Mangold, Matthew
6   Colangelo, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis.
7            MR. BLANCHE:  Todd Blanche, joined by Emil Bove,
8   Susan Necheles, and President Trump seated to my left.
9            THE COURT:  Good morning, Counsel.
10            Good morning, Mr. Trump.
11            THE COURT:  First, I want to thank you all for
12   working out your schedule so that you could be here at
13   8:45.
14            As you know, there were a couple of issues that
15   came up over the weekend. I wanted to be able to address
16   them before the jury got here, so they wouldn't have to
17   wait.
18            As a result of some of those issues, which we'll
19   discuss momentarily, and upon further consideration, as
20   you know, it's become apparent that we're not going to be
21   able to sum up tomorrow.
22            The details of the scheduling for the rest of the
23   week will be discussed later.
24            But, right now, it's looking much more like we're
25   going to be finishing up everything that's evidence,

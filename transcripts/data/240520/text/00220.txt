D. Sitko — Cross/Mangold
4211
1 A Yes.
2 Q That indicates that that call was 45 seconds; right?
3 A Yes.
4 Q And then on the right, where it has the originating
5 number, it has both the 7200 number, which is the law firm's
6 main number; right?
7 A Yes.
8 Q And then there's a second number below that, 3595;
9 right?
10 A Yes.
11 Q Do you know what that number indicates?
12 A I —— my understanding is that number indicates that
13 was forwarded to a voicemail, and that's a number associated
14 with a voicemail inbox.
15 Q So, is that a voicemail that was left after the
16 previous —— as part of that same call indicated above?
17 A Yes. I believe so.
18 Q Okay.
19 So, there are certain calls on this chart that are double
20 counted; right?
21 There's first —— like the one we're looking at here, the
22 first one with the missed call, that gets its own row. Then,
23 the second one is the voice call for that same call.
24 So, it's really just one call?
25 A Yeah.

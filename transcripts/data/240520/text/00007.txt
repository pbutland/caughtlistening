1 for him where they say: I'm glad we can give you some
2 comfort.
3 They may have been on different playing fields on
4 how they felt about the meeting.
5 The exhibits admitted were admitted, and they
6 were on Mr. Cohen's state of mind on why he made decisions
7 on how to act for a period of time and, including, why he
8 did not tell the truth for a period of time, including to
9 Mr. Costello.
10 THE COURT: I don't see any probative value for
11 impeachment purposes here at all.
12 Nowhere in this email does it express Mr. Cohen's
13 state of mind.
14 You can certainly ask him some followâ€”up
15 questions if you like.
16 Right now, this is double hearsay, and it's not
17 Mr. Cohen's state of mind.
18 So, I'm not going to allow it.
19 Please hand this back down.
20 MR. BLANCHE: Assuming it's okay with the Court,
21 I'll show him the email and ask him a series of questions
22 and, depending on his answers, potentially, offer it at
23 that point.
24 THE COURT: What kind of questions would you ask
25 him?

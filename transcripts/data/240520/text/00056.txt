1   an opening ceremony for that?
2       Do you remember that?
3       A    No, sir.
4       Q    So, but you do have a specific recollection, it sounds
5   like, that on those two phone calls, you just talked about the
6   Stormy Daniels deal; that's it?
7       A    Because they were important to me.
8       Q    So was fixing Tiffany Trump's situation important to
9   you?
10       A    It was important that I take care of it, but it was not
11   personally important to me.
12       Q    But that wouldn't have been something you updated her
13   father about when you spoke with him the next morning?
14       A    No, sir.
15       Q    No?  You wouldn't have updated him about any -- well,
16   let me ask you this:  At the time, that was right around the
17   time that there was still fallout from the Access Hollywood
18   tape; correct?
19       A    Correct.
20       Q    So, if there was going to be meetings and interviews
21   that day, you don't think you would have spoken with President
22   Trump about anything involving that issue, just about Stormy
23   Daniels?
24       A    My recollection is that I was speaking to him about
25   Stormy Daniels because that was what he tasked me to take care

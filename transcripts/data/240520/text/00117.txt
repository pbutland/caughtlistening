8 nonpayment was becoming an issue, correct?
9 A To keep him advised, yes, sir.
10 Q You asked Mr. Costello to do that, right?
11 A Yes, I believe so.
12 Q Well, do you have any doubt that it was you who
13 initiated that communication to Mr. Costello?
14 A I don’t recall if I asked him to reach out to Mr.
15 Giuliani, other than I expressed it to him.
16 Q And then —— and this is late June.
17 Is this around the time your relationship with
18 Mr. Costello and his law firm ends?
19 A Yes, sir.
20 Q That you had been —— like we talked about, you met
21 with him a couple of times and you were talking to them and
22 emailing them all the way up to this time in June, correct?
23 A Correct.
24 Q And those are privileged communications, correct?
25 A Yes, sir.

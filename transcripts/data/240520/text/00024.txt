Proceedings

1 to support the conclusion that Defendant and others
2 conspired to promote the election of any person to a
3 public office by entering into the scheme, specifically

6 including by violating FECA through the unlawful,
7 individual and corporate contributions by Cohen, Pecker
8 and AMI, and by falsifying the records of other New York
9 enterprises, and mischaracterizing the nature of their
10 payment for tax purposes.
11 So, dating back at least six months, we have been
12 clear to the Defense and to the Court that the Election
13 Law object crime relied for its unlawful meanings theory,
14 the unlawful FECA violations, unlawful false filings of
15 business records, and tax violations.
16 So, there‘s nothing new at all about the unlawful
17 means argument in our Election Law theory.
18 The second point I would make, as the Court has
19 just said, the Judge should and will charge on appropriate
20 legal definitions in the charge conference, and the
21 Defense is not entitled to have an expert front—end that
22 process.
23 I think, in some ways, what Mr. Bove just said,
24 asking your Honor for a preview of what you will do in the
25 charge conference, is to say: If your Honor is not

1        me -- the payment to Stephanie Clifford.
2                 That's extremely probative of the core issues in
3        this case. It's not collateral at all. It goes to the
4        heart of the Government's theory.
5                 So, both in terms of evidence of prior
6        inconsistent statements that we will be offering through
7        Mr. Costello -- that's somewhat limited -- and, also, I
8        think, more importantly, to rebut the Government's
9        pressure campaign theory. That's why this testimony is
10        admissible.
11                 You know, I understand the objections.
12                 THE COURT:  You don't think the pressure campaign
13        theory is collateral?
14                 MR. BOVE:  Not at all, Judge.
15                 They didn't just ask a guy questions about this.
16        They put in exhibits. They asked how the relationship
17        went.
18                 The whole purpose of this was to make President
19        Trump sound threatening, to make it sound like he was
20        interfering with the investigation.
21                 THE COURT:  I don't think so.
22                 I think the reason for it was to explain why at
23        one point he said one thing and at another point he said
24        something else.
25                 That doesn't go to the elements of your defense.

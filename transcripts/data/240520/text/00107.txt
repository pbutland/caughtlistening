3 Do you see that?

11 A Correct.
12 MR. BLANCHE: We offer B—lOO8.
13 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.
14 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

21 Q This is an email from you, right, to Mr. Costello?
22 And it says, Bob, as I have stated in the past, when
23 the right time comes, and now is not the right time, we will
24 advance our conversations regarding this issue. Too many hands

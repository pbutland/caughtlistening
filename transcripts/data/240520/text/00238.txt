7 Q Who was at the meeting at the Regency Hotel?
8 A Michael Cohen, Jeffrey Citron and myself.
9 Q Did the topic of potential cooperation come up?
10 A Yes, it did.
11 Q What was discussed?
12 A Well, first Michael Cohen explained his situation,
13 because I had never met Cohen before, so I had no idea what was
14 going on, that his home and his law office had been searched
15 pursuant to a search warrant.
16 And he was absolutely manic at the beginning and throughout
17 the two hours of that meeting; marching back and forth; pacing.
18 We were in a conference room on the second floor of the
19 Regency Hotel.
20 And he kept on pacing back and forth, left and right, while
21 myself and Jeff were seated.
22 And, after he explained what was going on, he said: My life

24 what's going to happen.
25 He said: I really want you to explain to me what my options

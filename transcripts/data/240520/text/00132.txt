M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche
4123
1 Q Now, you talked about, and this goes back to Thursday,
2 but you talked about the fact that you actually have a
3 financial interest in the outcome of this case, correct?
4 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
5 THE COURT: Sustained.
6 Q Well, do you have a financial interest in the outcome
7 of this case?
8 A Yes, sir.
9 Q Because if President Trump is convicted that would
10 benefit you personally, financially, right?
11 A No, sir.
12 Q Well, then, what is your financial interest in this
13 case?
14 A Whether or not —— when you say —— said, do I have a
15 financial interest in this case, I may talk about it on my
16 podcasts. I talk about it on TikTok, and they make money, and
17 that’s how I was viewing your question.
18 Whether Mr. Trump is ultimately determined innocent or
19 guilty is not going to affect whether I speak about it or not.
20 Q Well, I didn't ask whether it would prevent you from
21 speaking about it.
22 My question was, would you benefit financially from
23 it?
24 And this is different than what you said on Thursday,
25 sir.

2 THE COURT: Just so you know, I was just handed a
3 note, telling me that the alternate who had to leave by
4 one o'clock on Thursday has canceled his appointment, so
5 we no longer have to stop at one o'clock on Thursday.
6 I don't know that that really changes much,
7 because in the back of my mind, one of the options was
8 just to continue without him, anyway.
9 I don't think that changes much.
10 Look. You've all worked really hard on this case,
11 well before we stepped foot in this courtroom.
12 I don't think that we should rush through the
13 jury charges and the pre—charge conference.
14 We want to get this right. We all want to get it
15 right.
16 I want to hear your arguments. I want to be able
17 to research it.
18 I want to give you the proposed charges with as
19 much notice as possible so you can prepare your
20 summations.
21 Believe me, I would hate to be down from today
22 until next Tuesday. I've never done that. But, I think
23 that's what's in the best interest of the case.
24 MR. STEINGLASS: Can I ask a quick question —— of
25 course, we're fine with that.

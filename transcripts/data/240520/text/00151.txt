M. Cohen â€” Redirect/Hoffinger

1 I am not sure how the witness is going to answer
2 the question.
3 THE COURT: What is your proposed instruction?
4 MR. BLANCHE: If he says that it's not true, that
5 he did commit a campaign violation, we would ask for the
6 instruction that we asked for repeatedly that you gave,
7 the fact that he said that he committed a campaign
8 violation.
9 MS. HOFFINGER: Is it your understanding at this
10 point whether that's a false statement in the letter?
11 That's why I am asking.
12 MR. BOVE: That's why we want the clarification.
13 MS. HOFFINGER: Okay.
14 Thank you.
15 THE COURT: The Court's version is on Page 3964.
16 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:)
17 MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put back up the letter
18 again, People's Exhibit 201.
19 (Displayed.)
20 CONTINUED REDIRECT EXAMINATION
21 BY MS. HOFFINER:
22 Q. And the line in Paragraph 3 that says, "the payment in
23 question does not constitute a campaign contribution;" do you
24 see that line, Mr. Cohen?
25 A. I do.

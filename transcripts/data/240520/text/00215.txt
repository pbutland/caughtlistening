1       Um, the third is the time that the call was made in the
2   call logs. I adjusted that from -- on the call logs it appeared
3   in UTC. I adjusted it to be 12-hour time and also Eastern Time.
4       The fourth column is call "Duration".
5       The fifth and sixth columns are the identity that
6   correspond to the seventh and eighth columns, which is the
7   redacted phone numbers that appeared in the call logs.
8       I got those identities, um, again, from the exhibits
9   that have been admitted, including numbers that appeared in
10   Mr. Costello's email signature.
11       Q    It looks like the first call, for example, the
12   duration is 0000.
13       Is that true of a handful of the calls?
14       A    Yes.
15       Q    Do you have an understanding of what that means?
16       A    That means that the call was not answered.
17                 MR. BLANCHE:  So, if we can back this out and go
18        to the end of this chart.
19                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.)
20       Q    Do you know how many calls there were, in total,
21   including the ones that went unanswered?
22       A    Seventy-five, in total.
23       Q    Did you know whether there were several calls that
24   were longer than half an hour?
25       A    Yes.

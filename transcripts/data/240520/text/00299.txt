1 was supposed to be booked by the Trump —— by Ms. Tarasoff
2 when she gets the invoice. How is she supposed to book the
3 fact that the lawyer working for President Trump was his
4 personal attorney? Legal expense.
5 So —— I was going to just finish with Mr. Cohen.
6 I won't go on and on.
7 The other —— in addition to what I already said,
8 Judge, the exacting testimony that he gave this jury ——
9 and we crossed him on it, but a lot of the objections were
10 sustained. The exacting testimony that he gave about
11 particular conversations that he remembered with President
12 Trump in 2016, we never saw those. They're not in any
13 notes with the Special Counsel, with the Southern
14 District, or with the Manhattan District Attorney. That's
15 something that we talked about before.
16 He definitely talked about in the Grand Jury and
17 in meetings that there were phone calls and there were
18 conversations.
19 That's a lot different than what he said on the
20 stand when he gave very specific recollection.
21 That's something —— that's not something we knew
22 about. Apparently, the People knew he was going to do
23 that.
24 Under the law, if he's going to change his story
25 like that, they should provide us notes of that. They

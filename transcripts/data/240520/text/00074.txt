M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche

1 Weisselberg.
2 Q So, is it fair to say that once you became President
3 Trump's personal attorney in 2017, every single email you sent,
4 your signature block said the same thing; fair?
5 A Yes, sir.
6 Q Every time you sent an email, whether it was to a
7 potential client; right?
8 A Correct.
9 Q Whether it was to a friend?
10 A Yes, sir.
11 Q Whether it was to the Trump Org. sending an invoice, it
12 always said Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump;
13 right?
14 A Yes, sir.
15 Q And, by the way, that's the same job you had had for a
16 decade; right?
17 A Yes, except not to the President, CEO of the Trump
18 Organization as Special Counsel, but now it was Personal
19 Attorney to the President of the United States.
20 Q But what I mean is, his job changed, meaning President
21 Trump's job changed, your job didn't; right?
22 A Correct.
23 Q So —— and, again, at that time in 2017, as you were
24 rolling out to be Personal Attorney for President Donald J.
25 Trump, you told everybody that that was happening; correct?

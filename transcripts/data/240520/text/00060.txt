1   with him, and you gave him $20,000 to take care of that $50,000
2   bill?
3       A    Yes.
4       I don't recall if it was exactly 20,000, but he came to the
5   office and I gave him the cash.
6       Q    And when was that in relation to the meeting that you
7   had with Mr. Weisselberg in January of 2017?
8       A    Substantially before.
9       Q    "Substantially," like a year?
10       A    Ummm, yes, sir.
11       Q    More than a year?
12       A    It could have been a couple of months more.

14       So, at some point in late 2015 or early 2016 that happened?
15       A    I believe so.
16       Q    So, you paid him back his 20,000, and you were square
17   with him; right?
18       A    He would have liked the additional 30,000 as well.
19       Q    Well, we -- fair enough.
20       But, you said before, in meetings with prosecutors, that
21   that ended that dispute, that ended that issue with him; right?
22       A    Between us, yes.
23       Q    Well, who else would it have been between?
24       A    Mr. Trump and Red Finch.
25       Q    So did -- are you aware of Mr. Trump and Red Finch

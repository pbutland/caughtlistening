M. Cohen - Recross/Blanche
4201
1                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
2       Q    So, of all the time, the 11 years that you worked for
3   President Trump, do you recall him -- except for the payment
4   that we're talking about now, the 420,000 -- do you recall him
5   ever just willingly overpaying for something?
6                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
7                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
8                 You can answer.
9       A    No.  That's the first time that I recall Mr. Trump
10   paying for any NDA.
11       Q    That's when he repaid you or reimbursed you, according
12   to your testimony, the $130,000; correct?
13       A    Along with the other items, yes.
14       Q    Along with the other 20,000 for Red Finch; correct?
15       A    Well, it's not 20, but --  yes.
16       Q    It was 20. You charged him 50.
17                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
18                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
19                 MR. BLANCHE:  I have no more questions, Judge.
20                 THE COURT:  Anything else?
21                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Nothing, Judge.
22                 THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.
23                 You can step down.
24                 THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
25                 (Whereupon, the witness is excused.)

1       Q    Who is that an email from and to, and who is copied on
2   that?
3       A    That was from Jeffrey Citron to -- it's blocked out.
4   But this should have been Jeffrey Citron to Michael Cohen.
5       Q    And are you copied on that email, sir?
6       A    I'm sorry?
7       Q    Are you also copied on that email?
8       A    (Witness reading.)
9       Q    I know there are certain redactions, but does it
10   appear --
11       A    What's confusing to see is that this is sayings it's
12   from Michael Cohen to Jeffrey Citron, but I guess this is a
13   string.
14       Q    It's a string, so look at the bottom.
15       A    So I'm having trouble seeing the string, yes.
16       Q    So you were on those emails?
17       A    Yes, I was.
18                MS. HOFFINGER:  I offer those in evidence.
19                MR. BOVE:  No objection.
20                THE COURT:  Accepted into evidence.
21                (So marked in evidence.)
22                *********
23       Q    So, now you see an email that Mr. Citron sent and
24   copied you on.
25       Are you aware of that now?  Do you see that email exchange,

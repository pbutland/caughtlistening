M. Cohen — Redirect/Hoffinger
4148
1 paid off Stormy Daniels?
2 MR. BLANCHE: Objection.
3 May we approach.
4 (Whereupon, the following occurred sidebarz)
5 MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, they can't pick and
6 choose which portion of the allocution to read, at 3801 and
7 3802 ——
8 THE COURT: Go through the sections that he
9 pointed out.
10 MS. HOFFINGER: He specifically read to the
11 witness his allocution of August 21, 2018, and had him say
12 yes, that was what he allocuted to with respect to the
13 counts of tax evasion and the count of false statements to
14 the bank. But he did not read the allocution with respect
15 to the payoff to Stormy Daniels and the payoff to Karen
16 McDougal as being illegal campaign contributions.
17 He read that allocution. I think at this point
18 we're entitled to read the allocutions.
19 MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely not. The reason why
20 those were read is because he later said that he was lying
21 under oath when he had made those statements. That's why
22 we elicited that statement. That is perfectly legal and
23 proper to elicit specific incidents where the individual
24 has lied under oath.
25 The only reason why I elicited those statements

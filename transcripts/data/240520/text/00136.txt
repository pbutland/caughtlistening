Colloquy
4127
1                 Thank you, your Honor.
2                 May we approach for a moment, your Honor?
3                 THE COURT:  Yes.
4                      (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
5                 record.)
6                 MR. STEINGLASS:  So, your Honor has made it clear
7       many times that your rules and Motions in Limine are
8       subject to the door being opened.  And I think that Mr.
9       Blanche opened the door wide enough to drive a truck
10       through it on this Red Finch thing.
11                 Now --
12                 MR. BLANCHE:  What did you say?
13                 MR. STEINGLASS:  The Red Finch issue, the money.
14                 As you know from your decision, I have a copy of
15       the decision --
16                 THE COURT:  I am aware of it.
17                 MR. STEINGLASS:  -- he elicited questions about
18       there being cash in a paper bag and implied that there was
19       something untoward going on, which, of course, was going
20       on, but it was a payment for rigging the polls.
21                 I think that we are entitled to go into that.
22       They are not allowed to use the ruling as a sword and
23       that's exactly what they are doing.
24                 MR. BLANCHE:  Judge, absolutely not.
25                 I didn't ask questions about money in paper bags.

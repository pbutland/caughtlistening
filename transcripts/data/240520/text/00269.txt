1   extolling your experiences, your famous clients, and what you
2   wanted?
3       A    Except you misstated it before, you stated I was Chief
4   of the Criminal Division, it's Deputy Chief.
5       Q    I apologize for that.  Deputy Chief of the Criminal
6   Division.
7       Is that otherwise accurate, the question I asked you?
8       A    It is, yeah.
9       Q    And you were hoping that Michael Cohen would hire you
10   as his lawyer; correct?
11       A    I wasn't hoping anything.  It wasn't my email.
12       Q    I'm sorry, had you heard about the case in the news,
13   sir, that Michael Cohen had had search warrants in early April
14   of 2018, as the Personal Attorney to President Trump?
15       Had you heard about it in the news?
16       A    I probably did, yeah.
17       Q    It was big news; right?
18       A    If I heard about it, I guess it was.
19       Q    And you and your partner thought this would be a good
20   opportunity to see if you could get Michael Cohen as your
21   client; isn't that correct?
22       A    No.  This was Jeffrey Citron's relationship with
23   Michael Cohen.
24       He knew him for ten years.
25       I didn't know Michael Cohen from a hole in the wall.

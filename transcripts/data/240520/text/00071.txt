M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4062
1                 MR. BLANCHE:  Can we look at the first two lines
2        of the actual text of that email?
3                 (Displayed.)
4       Q    Can you go ahead and read that out to the jury, please?
5       A    "Thank you.  You never stopped in for a bro hug.
6   Anyway, please prepare the Agreement we discussed so we can pay
7   you monthly."
8                MR. BLANCHE:  You can take that down.
9       Q    Why would you have had to prepare an Agreement so that
10   you could get paid monthly if, as you said last week, you -- and
11   again a few minutes ago, there was never an expectation that you
12   were going to have an Agreement?
13       A    It was in order to get the reimbursement of the $35,000
14   per month back.
15       Q    Oh, I understand that.
16       But you just testified four minutes ago, and then you
17   testified last Tuesday, that you and Mr. Weisselberg had a deal
18   that there would never be an Agreement because it was all a
19   coverup; right?
20       That was your testimony last week, and that was your
21   testimony a few minutes ago; yes?
22       A    Yes, sir.
23       Q    All right.
24                MR. BLANCHE:  So, can we put up People's Exhibit 1,
25       please.

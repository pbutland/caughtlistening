1        in a trial.  I don't contest that.
2                 Here we are now where, literally, the People are
3        going to rest, and now they want more time to try to get a
4        witness here tomorrow about something that was had on
5        cross.
6                 That's not the way the trial is supposed to work,
7        Judge.
8                 THE COURT:  People, I would like you to take a
9        minute and see if she can be here 9:30 tomorrow.
10                 MR. STEINGLASS:  We reached out and we're waiting
11        to confirm.
12                 THE COURT:  Let's recess and get back to me in a
13        few minutes.
14                 (Recess.)
15                 ***
16                 THE COURT:  People, what did you find out?
17                 MS. MANGOLD:  Your Honor, we were able to reach
18        C-Span.  They are booking travel right now in order to be
19        available at 9:30 tomorrow morning.  They stress the
20        travel is not booked yet.  But they are preparing to do
21        that.
22                 THE COURT:  Anything else, Mr. Blanche?
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  No.  Just our continued objection.
24                 This will be fifth or sixth time we're going to
25        apparently run out of witnesses for the day.

M. Cohen — Redirect/Hoffinger

l summation.
2 We're entitled to establish —— I realize this is
3 not wholly responsive to what happened to their arguments,
4 what happened in the phone cal, it's certainly partially
5 responsive for us to be able to prove that the defendant
6 and Mr. Schiller were together at the time of this phone
7 call. And I think that relevancy is a low threshold.
8 So I think there is some probative value to that. There is
9 no prejudice. We can lay the proper foundation. That's
10 all we have to do.
11 MR. BLANCHE: I was not making this argument. I
12 was responding to the People's suggestion when we asked Mr.
13 Cohen we implied that he wasn't with Mr. Schiller. There
14 is no evidence of that. I have significant evidence that
15 he lied under oath when he said he had a conversation with
16 Mr. Trump that night. And that is what I crossed him on.
17 That's the issue.
18 Now, it's not a relevance argument. It's an
19 absolutely inadmissible hearsay argument.
20 If your Honor looks at the testimony from the
21 C—Span witness, including through Page 1668 and 69, there
22 was multiple questions to this witness about how careful
23 the process is to authenticate something that they record.
24 That's for good reason. The rules require it. It's not
25 they require it for one rally video. It doesn't count for

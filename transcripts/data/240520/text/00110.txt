M. Cohen - Cross/Blanche
4101
1   testimony from last week, those nine hours of calls that you
2   had, how many times did you meet with him personally?
3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection, your Honor.
4                 THE COURT:  Overruled.
5       Q    How many times, if you can recall, did you meet with
6   Mr. Costello in person?
7       A    I believe it was once or twice.
8       Q    So, the two times you met with him, and all of the
9   phone calls you had with him, you understood at the time that
10   those were privileged communications, right?
11       A    Yes, sir.
12       Q    Because you hadn't signed an Engagement Letter, right?
13       A    No, sir.
14       Q    But that doesn't mean that a conversation isn't
15   privileged?
16       A    Anticipation of potential representation.
17       Q    So, the signing of -- the fact that you had not signed
18   an Engagement Letter with Mr. Costello didn't mean that those
19   phone calls weren't privileged and didn't mean that those
20   meetings weren't privileged, right?
21       A    Correct.
22       Q    Now, I am going to show you another email.
23                 MR. BLANCHE:  Which we can show the witness,
24       parties and the Court, B-1003.
25                      (Displayed.)

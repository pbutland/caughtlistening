3 Q. Do you recall, Mr. Cohen, that defense counsel asked
4 you some additional questions about this document?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Is this a statement regarding the FEC matter that you
7 released to the press?
8 A. Yes.
9 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you about one line in this
10 letter, "Just because something isn't true doesn't mean it can't
11 cause you damage; I will always protect Mr. Trump."
12 Do you remember that question about that line?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Do you remember your answer of why you included that
15 line, you said you wanted reporters to believe that it was true?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Now, in general, was the statement that you issued to
18 the press overall, was it false or misleading?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Why was it so?
21 A. Again, it goes back to the part about neither The Trump
22 Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the
23 transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed me for the
24 payment either directly or indirectly.
25 Q. So what was missing?

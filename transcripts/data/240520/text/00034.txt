1 A Correct.
2 Q So, my question is different than the way you’re
3 answering.
4 When they asked you questions last Monday and Tuesday,
5 okay, when Ms. Hoffinger asked you questions, you had heard
6 those questions from her before, during prep; correct?
7 A Some of them. Not all of them.
8 Q What's a question you were asked last week that you
9 were hearing for the first time?
10 A (Shakes head). I can’t tell you. There were many
11 questions that I have not heard before.
12 Q So, you heard many questions last Monday or Tuesday
13 that you were hearing for the very first time?
14 A Yes, sir.
15 Q How about documents?
16 The documents that you were shown by the People last Monday
17 and Tuesday and the emails and text messages and the records
18 and the invoices, you had reviewed those in prep with the
19 People; right?
20 A That's correct.
21 Q And there were some emails and documents, I assume,
22 that you were shown in prep that you were not shown last week;
23 meaning you went over them in prep, but they, ultimately,
24 weren't shown to you by the People last week; right?
25 A Correct.

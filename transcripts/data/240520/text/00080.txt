4071
1       Q    For example, there were issues at the time with
2   reporters potentially making defamatory statements against
3   President Trump; right?
4       A    Yes, sir.
5       Q    And you helped -- that was part of your job, right, to
6   help with that?
7       A    Yes, sir.
8       Q    And you have met regularly with counsel, including
9   Mr. Kasowitz, in February as well, on not only the case you were
10   lead counsel on, but some other matters as well; right?
11       A    Yes, sir.
12       Q    And there was -- I mean, just so the jury understands,
13   and to help us understand, that was a case that actually had
14   legal filings that had to be made; right?
15       A    Yes.
16       Q    So it wasn't just, like a threat of litigation, there
17   was ongoing litigation with legal filings; right?
18       A    Yes, sir.
19       Q    And you were part of that?
20       A    Yes.
21       Q    Your role changed, is that fair; is that what you
22   said?
23       A    Yes.
24       Q    Okay.  So, certainly, talking about January and
25   February, you were actively a part of that; correct?

1   filings, researching stuff, editing motions.
2       Q    This past Friday, so three days ago, after trial ended
3   on Thursday, were you asked to do anything?
4       A    Yes. I was asked to create a Summary Chart of phone
5   calls.
6       Q    What did you do to accomplish that task?
7       A    So, I looked in the People's Exhibit 400 for the phone
8   logs for Mr. Cohen's phone number ending 0114. I looked for
9   contacts or -- contact between that phone number and three
10   phone numbers associated with Robert Costello.
11       So, anyone that may have appeared in that phone log, I
12   would copy and paste certain information, like the time the
13   phone call was made, how long the phone call lasted, the date,
14   into an Excel spreadsheet.
15       Q    So, you created an Excel spreadsheet?
16       A    Yes.
17       Q    I'm going to show you, the Court, and the parties what
18   I marked for identification as B101A.
19                 (Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of
20        the witness and the parties.)
21       Q    Is this the Excel spreadsheet you created?
22       A    Yes.
23       Q    Does it accurately reflect, with the exception of
24   redactions, the information that you reviewed from the phone
25   records you just described?

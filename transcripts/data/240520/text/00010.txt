Proceedings

1 The second term is the, "Irrespective Rule."
2 Here, the Defendant would like to elicit, among
3 other things, testimony regarding the Federal Register
4 Provision that discusses the PEG.
5 They would also like to rely upon agency advisory
6 opinions and agency adjudications.
7 I won't go into the "Press Exemption" here
8 because you both submitted your exceptions as to that.
9 Ordinarily, expert testimony is permissible to
10 assist the jury in understanding topics that are beyond
11 the ken of the average juror. For example, DNA evidence,
12 blood splatter evidence, and countless other fields.
13 But, an expert is not permitted to present or
14 interpret the law.
15 However, it seems to this Court that it will be
16 impossible for Mr. Smith to testify about these three
17 subjects without invoking, discussing and interpreting the
18 application of Federal Law in the form of legal precedent,
19 advisory opinions, agency adjudications, and even the
20 purpose and intent behind the creation of some of these
21 rules.
22 In his argument on Thursday, Mr. Bove offered
23 that Mr. Smith would only testify as to very basic matters
24 and, at a bare minimum.
25 See Thursday's transcript on Page 238.

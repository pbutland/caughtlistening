l A Yes, sir.
2 Q During the testimony you gave in February of 2019,
3 that's one of the times when you lied; right?
4 A Yes, sir.
5 Q Now, I’m gonna start, briefly, with the time in
6 October of 2016; okay.
7 So, we’re going back to the few weeks leading up to when
8 you put money in and then paid the NDA with Ms. Daniels; okay.
9 So, early October until October 26th; okay.
10 You said last week, correct me if I’m wrong, that there was
ll significant urgency to the Daniels situation at that time;
12 right?
13 A Correct.
14 Q And that issue, the Ms. Daniels issue was taking a lot
15 of your time; right?
16 A Yes, sir.
17 Q And when you spoke with President Trump during that
18 time, you testified last week that many of the times you spoke
19 with him, it was about that issue; right?
20 A Yes, sir.
21 Q Whether it was on the phone or in person; right?
22 A Correct.
23 Q But, you'll agree with me, right, that you had a lot
24 going on, both in your personal life and with President Trump,
25 in those first few weeks of October; right?

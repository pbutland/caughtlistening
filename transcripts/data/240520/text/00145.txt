1 some period?
2 A. For some period.
3 Q. Now, Mr. Blanche did ask you also about that extra
4 $30,000 that you got from The Trump Organization for Red Finch,
5 you paid your friend 20 but you took the 30. Why did you take
6 that extra 30? Why didn't you just put 20 down on the list
7 instead of 50?
8 A. For a long time I had been telling them about the
9 $50,000, so I could have collected it for the President of Red
10 Finch.
11 I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus so
12 I just felt it was almost like self—help. You know, I wasn‘t
13 going to let him have the benefit this way as well. I wasn't
14 going to correct the conversation I was having with Allen about
15 it. I had not only protected him to the best that I could, but
16 I had also laid out money to Red Finch like a year and a half
17 earlier.
18 And, again, $130,000, to have my bonus cut by
19 two—thirds was very upsetting, to say the least.
20 Q. But you admitted on cross—examination that it was
21 wrongful?
22 A. It was.
23 Q. Now, defense counsel asked you last week some questions
24 about the letter that your attorney Steven Ryan wrote for you in
25 February of 2018 and submitted to the FEC in response to that

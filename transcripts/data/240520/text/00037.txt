1 A Yes, sir.
2 Q Do you recall dealing with a meaningful issue with
3 respect to your taxi medallion business and whether you should
4 invest or restructure loans? Do you remember doing that at the
5 time?
6 A Yes, sir.
7 Q You were doing that with Mr. Freidman? He was,
8 possibly, part of that deal?
9 A No, sir. That’s incorrect.
10 Q We’ll come back to that.
11 You were also dealing with a loan —— I think it was a
12 loan —— correct me if I’m wrong —— on one of your investment
13 properties that you have with your brother; is that right?
14 A I had an investment property with my brother, but
15 there was no loan.
16 I believe it was a sale.
17 Q Well, do you recall in the October timeframe working
18 on —— working with a lawyer to close a deal that generated
19 $7 million, that ultimately closed at the end of October of
20 2016?
21 A Yes, sir.
22 As I said, it was a sale.
23 Q And that was with your brother?
24 A Yes, sir.
25 Q Now, you also were working —— you testified last week

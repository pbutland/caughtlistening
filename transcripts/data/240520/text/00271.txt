1       Q    And it would get you public exposure; wouldn't it?
2       A    Yes, it would.
3       Q    And you would be in the news as his attorney; right?
4       A    I guess that's true, yes.
5       Q    And this is what you would call a high profile case for
6   you; right?
7       A    Probably, yes.
8       Q    And it would connect you with the President of the
9   United States, right, because he was his former -- his Personal
10   Attorney; right?
11       A    No, it would not.
12       Q    It wouldn't connect you with the President of the
13   United States and those who were close him, like Rudy Giuliani?
14       A    No.  Rudy Giuliani wasn't involved in representing
15   President Trump at that point in time.  He wasn't in the picture
16   at all.
17       Q    But just a few days later he was representing President
18   Trump; right?
19       A    Two days later is not the date that we met, yes.
20       Q    So, is it your testimony that this wouldn't push you
21   into the arena with Rudy Giuliani and President Trump by
22   representing Michael Cohen?
23       A    I don't understand that question.
24       What do you mean it would "push me into the arena?"
25       Q    Well, I will withdraw the question.

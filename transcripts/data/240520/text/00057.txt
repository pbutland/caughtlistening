1   of and that's what I had been working on.
2       Q    Do you recall ever speaking with President Trump about
3   the fact that he was opening a hotel in the old Post Office in
4   Washington, D.C.?
5       A    Yes, we've had conversations about that.
6       Q    Even before it was opened; right?
7       A    Yes, sir.
8       Q    But you wouldn't have talked to him about that on that
9   day?
10       A    No, sir.
11       Q    Just about the Daniels situation?
12       A    As I recall, yes.
13       Q    Now, I want to talk for a few minutes now about
14   the Retainer Agreement -- the meeting that you had with
15   Mr. Weisselberg in January 2017 and you talked about -- you met
16   with him, you brought the statement that showed that you had
17   transferred $131,000, and then there is writing from you and
18   there is writing from Mr. Weisselberg; correct?
19       Do you know what I'm talking about?
20       A    Yes, sir.
21       Q    And I believe your testimony is that the way that the
22   $35,000 a month -- the way that that number was kind of
23   developed was $130,000 for the payment to Ms. Daniels; right?
24       A    Correct.
25       Q    $50,000 from the Red Finch polling situation?

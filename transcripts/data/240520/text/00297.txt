Proceedings

1 another crime, your Honor, there were weeks and weeks of
2 testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony
3 was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous
4 phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a
5 conspiracy that was entered into in Trump Tower in August
6 of 2015, that was then effectuated through unlawful means.
7 The "unlawful means" include an illegal corporate
8 contribution to Karen McDougal, the illegal —— the
9 excessive individual campaign contribution to Stormy
10 Daniels.
11 And then, of course, your Honor, there's
12 extensive evidence of other false business records being
13 created in the course of carrying out that conspiracy,
14 including the false invoice from Investor Advisory
15 Services to conceal the intended transaction between AMI
16 and Mr. Trump, as well as all of the false documents that
17 Mr. Cohen submitted to his bank in order to open both of
18 the shell companies he intended to use to tender the
19 transfer.
20 There's a lot more. We don't need to give a full
21 summation in order to rebut the information Mr. Blanche
22 gave.
23 The trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each
24 of the element of the offense, and the trial Order of
25 dismissal is not warranted.

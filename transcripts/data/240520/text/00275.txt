1 this email.
2 And this is his response to it.
3 Q Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about meeting at
4 the Regency on April 16th, 2016.
5 Now, Mr. Cohen agreed to meet with you and Mr. Citron;
6 correct?
7 A Yes. On April 17th.
8 Mr. Cohen requested to meet with us. He asked us to come to
9 the Regency Hotel.
10 Q Sure.
11 After your partner —— as we saw in the email —— reached out
12 to him and asked if he would like to meet with you; isn't that
13 right?
14 A No. That's not what he said. He said to Michael
15 Cohen, I have a partner who used to be the Deputy Chief of the
16 Criminal Division of the US Attorney's Office. If you want to
17 pick his brain, let me know.
18 And Michael Cohen responded immediately, yes, I want to meet
19 him.
20 Q So, Mr. Citron reached out to see if Michael Cohen
21 would want to speak to you and you had a meeting with him; is
22 that right?
23 A Yes. Yes, that's what the email said.
24 Q Okay. So let's talk about the meeting on April 17th?
25 A Sure.

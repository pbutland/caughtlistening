10                  THE CLERK:  Remain seated.
12
11                  Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.
13
12                  THE COURT:  Going back to my request that you
14
13         submit the proposals, what I would like is for one side or
15
14         the other to draft a proposal as to each one of these
16
15         theories, give it to the other side. Then I can get
17
16         redline version of it and see where you differ.
18
17                  Because, the safer course may be, at the end of
19
18         the day, to keep things as simple as possible for the
20
19         jury.
21
20                  And, if the two sides can agree on the
22
21         definitions of these terms, that's all the better.
23
22                  You decide who wants to draft it and who wants to
24
23         do the redline. You can send it to me.
25   24                  MR. BOVE:  Yes, Judge.
26   25                  THE COURT:  Let's get the witness, please.

10 THE CLERK: Remain seated.
11 Come to order. Part 59 is back in session.
12 THE COURT: Going back to my request that you
13 submit the proposals, what I would like is for one side or
14 the other to draft a proposal as to each one of these
15 theories, give it to the other side. Then I can get
16 redline version of it and see where you differ.
17 Because, the safer course may be, at the end of
18 the day, to keep things as simple as possible for the
19 jury.
20 And, if the two sides can agree on the
21 definitions of these terms, that's all the better.
22 You decide who wants to draft it and who wants to
23 do the redline. You can send it to me.
24 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.
25 THE COURT: Let's get the witness, please.

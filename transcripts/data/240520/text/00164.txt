M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4155
1            Number two:  I was previously represented by the law
2   firm of McDermott Will & Emery in connection with the
3   investigation that preceded this case, the SDNY investigation,
4   as well as in connection with investigations into alleged
5   Russian influence in the 2016 Presidential Election.
6            During the period in which I was represented by MWE, I
7   was approached by Robert Costello, Esquire, of the law firm of
8   Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLC.
9            Costello sought to represent me in connection with the
10   SDNY investigation and presented me with a Retainer Agreement.
11            I declined to sign the Retainer Agreement and informed
12   him I was already represented.
13            Although, I subsequently had several other
14   conversations and communications with Costello, at no time did I
15   sign a retainer or otherwise agree to retain Costello, nor did I
16   ever consider Costello or any lawyer at DHC to be my attorney.
17            Although, I do not believe that any of my
18   communications with Costello or other lawyers at DHC are subject
19   to attorney-client privilege, I hereby waive whatever
20   attorney-client or other privilege that might be argued.  I have
21   attached such communications."
22       Q.   You can take that down.
23            There was a last line there.  I apologize.
24       A.   "I have discussed the foregoing with my current counsel
25   and am making this waiver knowingly and voluntarily."

1 and the instructions that you gave Michael Cohen.
2 A Okay.
3 I explained to Michael Cohen that this entire legal problem
4 that he was facing would be resolved by the end of the week if
5 he had truthful information on Donald Trump and cooperated with
6 the Southern District of New York.
7 Q And what, if anything, did Michael Cohen say about
8 President Trump at that point in the meeting?
9 A He made the same statement that he made about 10 or 12
10 times that day; quote: "I swear to God, Bob. I don’t have
11 anything on Donald Trump."
12 Q Did the topic of Stormy Daniels come up?
13 A It did.
14 Q What, if anything, did Cohen say about Stormy Daniels
15 during the meeting?
16 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.
17 THE COURT: Overruled.
18 You can answer.
19 A He began by saying: "I don't understand why they’re
20 trying to put me in jail for some F’ing NDAs," which is a
21 Non—Disclosure Agreement.
22 He then said, "I did an NDA with Stormy Daniels."
23 So, I asked him to tell me about what the circumstances
24 were, how was he involved.
25 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

1            MR. BLANCHE:  Impeachment evidence, you're
2   allowed to impeach with hearsay evidence. There's nothing
3   wrong with that.
4            THE COURT:  Not for the truth. Not for the truth.
5            MR. BLANCHE:  Well, I'm not offering this email
6   for the truth of the matter asserted.
7            I'm offering it because there, presumably, will
8   be testimony -- unless he says something different
9   today -- that what happened at the meeting is different
10   than what this email suggests.
11            So, if he testifies something different happened
12   than what this email suggests -- it's not to say this
13   email is right.
14            THE COURT:  Which meeting are you referring to,
15   specifically?
16            MR. BLANCHE:  This is the initial meeting, when
17   they first met.
18            There was a couple of phone calls, your Honor,
19   and they met at a hotel with Mr. Cohen, and then there was
20   a follow-up phone call.
21            And so, what this -- what this email is about,
22   apparently, is Mr. Citron's communication with his
23   partner, Mr. Costello, about their views of how the
24   meeting went with Mr. Cohen, which is, potentially,
25   different than what -- not "potentially" -- that's

M. Cohen — Redirect/Hoffinger
4162
1 7:57 p.m., which shows that they're together.
2 That is in response to any potential defense
3 suggestion that maybe the call that took place on the
4 night of October 24th between Mr. Cohen and Keith
5 Schiller —— that the defense, should not be able to argue
6 that Mr. Trump was not there and did not participate in the
7 conversation or subsequent conversation during the same
8 call.
9 So I believe that it takes three things to get
10 this photo in.
11 One is that, the witness has to identify the
12 parties, which the witness has done.
13 Two, we have to be able to establish how this was
14 pulled from C—Span's archives, from their website, which we
15 have a paralegal lined up to do.
16 The third piece comes from C—Span themselves, when
17 they testified earlier in this trial, the way they archive
18 and produce case materials, which is enough to lay the
19 proper foundation to admit the photos which proves that the
20 defendant and Mr. Schiller were together at the time of
21 that call on October 24th.
22 THE COURT: So you're offering it to establish the
23 date and the time?
24 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.
25 THE COURT: Do you have a copy?

Proceedings
4004
1            I believe you both already submitted proposals
2   for the "Press Exemption".
3            Having said that, that does not, necessarily,
4   mean I will use either one or the other. I may not
5   instruct the jury on either one of those rules.
6            As far as what the expert can testify to, I
7   direct you back to Page 3 of my decision.
8            He can testify as to what the FEC is, its
9   purpose, background as to who makes up the FEC, what laws,
10   if any, the FEC are responsible for enforcing, and general
11   definitions and terms related directly to this case, such
12   as "contribution", "expenditure", and "independent
13   expenditure".
14            By "general definitions", I mean just that.
15   Where the FEC has defined a general term, the expert can
16   refer to that definition, but he cannot interpret it.
17            I also do not want the expert to delve into
18   defining words or phrases contained within a word or
19   phrase he is already defining. In other words, no
20   sub-phrases or sub-definitions.
21            I invite both sides to come to the charge
22   conference prepared to argue these issues, and I also
23   invite you to submit written proposals in advance of the
24   charge conference.
25            Any questions about that?

Proceedings
4285
1   for the motion the Defense just made requires assessing
2   the evidence in the light most favorable to the
3   Prosecution, assuming that the jury credits the People's
4   witnesses and giving the Prosecution's evidence the full
5   weight it might reasonably be accorded.
6            So, against that backdrop, there's just no
7   argument that the evidence falls short of the standard the
8   People need to show to defeat this motion.
9            Let me address -- I think Mr. Blanche made three
10   key arguments:
11            First is that there's no evidence of falsity
12   because Mr. Cohen performed or provided legal services in
13   2017.
14            The trial record overwhelmingly rebuts the
15   argument "there's no evidence of falsity."
16            Among other things, Mr. Cohen performed similar
17   legal services in 2018 and was not paid.
18            Then, of course, you have People's Exhibits 35
19   and 36, accompanied by the testimony of Jeff McConney
20   explaining those documents, which memorialize and track
21   the conversion of the $130,000 wire transfer to Keith
22   Davidson into the exact $420,000 reimbursement that
23   Mr. Cohen ultimately received.
24            On top of that, you have the admission in at
25   least three other pieces of evidence we introduced.

M. Cohen â€” Redirect/Hoffinger
4181
1 We have witnesses here, ready to go, and we think
2 the decision that your Honor made, that a witness has to
3 come and testify about this shouldn't then be immediately
4 compromised by giving the People more time to get the
5 witness.
6 MR. STEINGLASS: That is wrong. We haven't broken
7 early five or six days early. I can remember we broke one
8 day early for a private medical matter that we shared with
9 the Court. That is just wrong.
10 The testimony of this witness is so narrow that
11 none of the proffered defense witnesses spoke to it. There
12 is no particular reason why we couldn't keep going on.
13 If Mr. Blanche wishes to do that or if your Honor
14 has indicated a willingness to adjourn the case until
15 tomorrow and let Mr. Blanche put on his case tomorrow, that
16 is also fine. Essentially, the ball is in Mr. Blanche's
17 court.
18 THE COURT: I remember stopping early one time for
19 medical reasons.
20 Look, if scheduling were an issue, if time were of
21 the essence, I would agree with you, Mr. Blanche. We
22 agreed this morning that we are basically going to have a
23 week down. We're sending the jury home for a week to do
24 nothing. So, there is no prejudice to anyone that I can
25 see whatsoever.

9 there is a whole lot of detail about how the camera
10 operator reports the events in realtime. And the camera
11 operator has a business duty to do so accurately. They
12 try to record the entire event. They watch it from end to
13 end to make sure there is no interruptions when it airs.

16 the foundation requirements.
17 It seems like Mr. Blanche is also making a kind of
18 a relevance argument and saying that it's irrelevant to
19 their arguments that Mr. Trump was together with Mr.
20 Schiller at that time, and not just together, but that the
21 speech ended at 7:57, that the defendant was giving that
22 night. They walked off the stage together at 7:57.

24 an implication that was raised by defense's questions.
25 Who knows what they're going to say in their

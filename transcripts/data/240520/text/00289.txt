1 MR. BLANCHE: By the way, there was no discussion
2 at this October 2015 meeting about catch and kill. Nobody
3 said that.
4 There was no discussion about any financial
5 payments that would potentially be made with respect to
6 any stories.
7 So, you don't have evidence of any criminal
8 intent or criminal conduct at this supposed first meeting
9 where the conspiracy is born and then played out over the
10 next year plus.
11 Then, when you look at actually how the
12 conspiracy played out, Karen McDougal, if the evidence is
13 to be credited, she never even wanted her story out. She
14 was looking to start her career anew, jumpstart her
15 career. She wanted an arrangement with AMI so that she
16 could be on the covers of magazines, write a column; not
17 catch and kill a story.
18 While that's the words used by Mr. Cohen and in
19 opening statements, that's not the evidence that came out
20 at trial.
21 That was a demonstrably false story. Everybody
22 agrees.
23 So, again, if there's some conspiracy to
24 influence an election or some conspiracy to illegally
25 influence an election, how on Earth is keeping a false

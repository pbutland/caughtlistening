1                  MR. BLANCHE:  By the way, there was no discussion
3
2         at this October 2015 meeting about catch and kill. Nobody
4
3         said that.
5
4                  There was no discussion about any financial
6
5         payments that would potentially be made with respect to
7
6         any stories.
8
7                  So, you don't have evidence of any criminal
9
8         intent or criminal conduct at this supposed first meeting
10
9         where the conspiracy is born and then played out over the
11
10         next year plus.
12
11                  Then, when you look at actually how the

16         could be on the covers of magazines, write a column; not
18
17         catch and kill a story.

20
19         opening statements, that's not the evidence that came out
21
20         at trial.
22
21                  That was a demonstrably false story. Everybody
23
22         agrees.
24
23                  So, again, if there's some conspiracy to
25   24         influence an election or some conspiracy to illegally

1 you are in a 50 percent tax bracket, right?
2 A Correct.
3 Q But you didn't claim that $35,000 a month on your
4 taxes?
5 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
6 THE COURT: Sustained.
7 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, may we approach?
8 THE COURT: Yes.
9 (Discussion is held at sidebar, on the
10 record.)
11 MS. HOFFINGER: This has bean precluded by your
12 decision very clearly. Whatever he did or did not do does
13 not go to the defendant’s intent.
14 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, it is an additional
15 $150,000 he stole from The Trump Organization. If you
16 accept his testimony, he was entitled to a reimbursement.
17 THE COURT: You can say he stole money. You can
18 talk about stealing money all you want.
19 Once you start talking about filing taxes, you
20 get into my ruling, and I already precluded that.
21 MR. BLANCHE: Okay.
22 So I can ask him about whether he actually stole
23 more money from the Trump Organization?
24 THE COURT: Okay.
25 MS. HOFFINGER: That has been asked and answered.

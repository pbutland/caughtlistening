Proceedings

1 respectfully, learn about that when the People submitted
2 their instructions. So, it was recent, in fairness to us.
3 THE COURT: Again, it's just a proposed
4 instruction. That's all it is.
5 MR. BOVE: I can't imagine your Honor is going to
6 put to the jury a theory that's different than the one the
7 People are explaining of the case.
8 That's all I mean.
9 THE COURT: I can tell you that I'm going to be
10 consistent with my earlier rulings.
11 If you recall, the People initially had four
12 theories. I ruled that they could not use one of those
13 four theories, and there were three theories left.
14 To the extent it's your opinion —— and I think
15 there's some merit to your argument —— that it appears
16 there might not be one theory and that the others are
17 being kind of inserted to that one theory, I can tell you,
18 the Court has taken note of that.
19 MR. BOVE: So, the only point I'm making —— this
20 is a very long windup. I'm sorry.
21 We appreciate you being here.
22 THE COURT: It's all right.
23 MR. BOVE: From our perspective, the way ——
24 however your Honor is going to treat the Government's
25 proposal, the way the Government's proposal is structured

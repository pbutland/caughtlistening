1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You can take that down.
2       Q    And you were Personal Attorney to President Trump at

8       Do you remember those questions?
9       A    I do.
10       Q    Putting aside financial matters, putting that to

18                 MS. HOFFINGER:  One moment, please.

21   result?

23       Q    Personal attacks?
24       A    Yes, ma'am.

1 get you paid; right?
2 A Correct.
3 Q We will send it monthly?
4 A Yes, sir.
5 Q But, your testimony, I think —— correct me if I'm
6 wrong —— is that there was never an expectation that there would
7 be a Retainer Agreement; right?
8 A Correct.
9 Q And, by the way, you had never had a Retainer Agreement
10 when you worked for Trump Org; right?
11 A That's correct.
12 Q We went over this last week.
13 But, you never had one with the personal work you were doing
14 for President Trump; right?
15 A Correct.
16 Q You never had one for any of the work that you were
17 doing for any of his children; right?
18 A Correct.
19 Q And the clear deal between you and Mr. Weisselberg was
20 that you weren't going to have one going forward; right?
21 A This was for reimbursement; correct.
22 Q Right. Correct.
23 Because if you weren't going to be paid for being his
24 lawyer, this was just some big coverup, some big reimbursement
25 for the $130,000; right?

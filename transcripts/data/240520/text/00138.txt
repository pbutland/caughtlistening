3   REDIRECT EXAMINATION
4   BY MS. HOFFINGER:
5       Q    Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.
6       A    Good afternoon.
7       Q    I just want to ask you some follow-up questions based
8   on defense counsel's questions.
9            Now, defense counsel asked you a question, and it was
10   rather fast, but I want to ask it a little bit more slowly.
11            He asked whether you testified falsely in Congress in
12   2019.
13            Did you testify truthfully in Congress in 2019?
14       A    Yes, ma'am.
15       Q    Was it in Congress in 2017 that you testified falsely?
16       A    Yes, ma'am.  That's what I thought he said.
17       Q    Was it just a mistake then when you said yes, when he
18   asked you about 2019?
19       A    Yes, ma'am.
20       Q    Now, defense counsel asked you if you may have
21   discussed other matters on the telephone calls in the morning
22   of October 26th of 2016, with President Trump, meaning other
23   matters, besides the Stormy Daniels matter.
24            Do you remember that question?
25       A    I do.

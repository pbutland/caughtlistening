D. Sitko — Direct/Blanche
4205
1 A Yes.
2 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we offer BlOlA, a
3 Summary Chart.
4 MS. HOFFINGER: No objection.
5 THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.
6 (Whereupon, Defense Exhibit BlOlA is received in
7 evidence.)
8 MR. BLANCHE: If we can put that on the screen.
9 (Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens.)
10 Q Looking at the top of the first page, can you just
11 explain the Call Summary and walk through the headers,
12 Mr. Sitko?
13 A Sure.
14 So, at the top, it was the two participants that we —— that
15 I culled the calls for, one being Mr. Cohen and the second
16 being Mr. Costello.
17 Right below his name on the right side of the page is a
18 number that appeared in Mr. Costello’s email signature on
19 People's Exhibit —— I think it was, um, 206 and 204. I might
20 have the numbers a little wrong. But, associated with his law
21 firm.
22 The first column on the left is "Call Number". That just is
23 a way to keep track of which call in the chart we're referring
24 to.
25 Second is "Date".

1       A    No, sir.
2       Q    Did he happily write checks to lawyers, for example?
3       A    No, sir.
4       Q    One of the first things that you said you had to do
5   when you started working at The Trump Organization was to bring
6   a lot of bills down, and I think you said 20 percent is what
7   folks got paid; right?
8       A    No.
9       What you're referring to was for Trump University where
10   people accepted 20 percent.
11       It's different than for the legal fees.
12       Q    Oh. Understood.
13       Sorry. Legal fees is one thing.
14       This is different vendors that were owed money for Trump
15   University; correct?
16       A    Correct.
17       Q    And you made phone calls; and every time you got one
18   of them to pay just 20 percent, you said you had marched into
19   President Trump's office and you told him, you reported --
20                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.
21                 THE COURT:  Sustained.
22       Q    My question is -- and you understand that in 2016,
23   when he was running for election, he spent somewhere around
24   70 million of his own money on the campaign; correct?
25                 MS. HOFFINGER:  Objection.

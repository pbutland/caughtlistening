1 So, Exhibit 1014, and go to the second page at
2 the top.
3 (Displayed.)
4 Q You were also talking to him about who was going to
5 pay for Mr. Costello, correct?
6 And the reason why I ask that question, Mr. Cohen, is
7 because it looks like the earlier email that we just showed
8 you, you write to Mr. Costello, not sure what concerns, meaning
9 what concerns you have, sir, other than nonpayment that you
10 expressed that you told Mr. Costello about, and that was your
11 lawyers had stopped getting paid, correct?
12 A And McDermott Will and Emery.
13 Q So, in the time that you started speaking with Mr.
14 Costello in April, and now there had been a change in whether
15 The Trump Organization was paying the lawyers, right?
16 A Correct.
17 Q And as far as you knew at the time, they had stopped?
18 A No, sir.
19 Q So, what had happened that caused you to write to Mr.
20 Costello, nonpayment I expressed to you?
21 A There was significant invoices that were being sent by
22 McDermott Will and Emery to The Trump Organization for the
23 payment, and the payment was not being made in accordance with
24 the invoices.
25 Q And you wanted Mr. Costello to talk to Mr. Giuliani

1        rally video, is a business record, doesn't mean that
2        whatever else that company produced or whatever else we
3        pull off the internet we can go and borrow those
4        foundational questions.  I would say that probably applies
5        to the video as well.  It's not the way the rules of
6        evidence work.
7                 By the way, I am sure that the People knew about
8        this issue, we certainly did, before today.  And so, they
9        should have brought the witness back.
10                 I mean, it cannot be that there is a hearsay
11        exception that applies that can easily be cured and that
12        the People will say we tried once, we're not going to try
13        it this time.
14                 THE COURT:  What are the pages of Mr. Browning's
15        testimony?
16                 MR. STEINGLASS:  It's Dr. Browning.
17                 THE COURT:  Dr. Browning.  I am sorry.
18                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I am not sure the pagination on
19        the small version is exactly as your Honor.  It's
20        approximately Page 1665.  All of his testimony starts on
21        1660 and goes to 1670.
22                 THE COURT:  I am not concerned.  I think it's
23        relevant.  I want to look into the hearsay issue.  We will
24        discuss it after lunch.
25                 Enjoy your lunch.

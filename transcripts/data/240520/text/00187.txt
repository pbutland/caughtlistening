M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4178
1                 I think it certainly was our position that the
2        foundation that was set forth by Dr. Browning was
3        sufficient to do this through this witness, through not
4        only through the three pieces that I articulated before
5        lunch.
6                 I don't want to characterize your Honor's ruling.
7        I understand it.  I will certainly follow it.
8                 I think we have more than a good faith basis to
9        believe it was going to come in.
10                 It doesn't seem like Mr. Blanche is going to
11        contest the fact they were together.
12                 I am not sure why we're jumping through all the
13        hoops.  I understand the rules of evidence apply.  They
14        have the right to put us through our burden.
15                 They don't have to stipulate, for example, that
16        Mr. Schiller was together with Mr. Trump on that date and
17        time.  Although, it does not sound like they're contesting
18        that.
19                 That being said, we're doing the best we can to
20        get this witness here as quickly as possible.  Hopefully,
21        that will be tomorrow morning.
22                 THE COURT:  All right.
23                 Are you objecting to letting the People finish out
24        this witness and put on your case and then we adjourn to
25        tomorrow morning and call this witness?

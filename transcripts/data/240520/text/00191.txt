M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4182
1                 Clearly, it's up to you.  You can present your
2        case out of order or once we finish with Mr. Cohen we can
3        adjourn to tomorrow morning.
4                 The witness has to be here at 9:30.  The witness
5        has to take the stand at 9:30.  If that doesn't happen,
6        we're going to proceed.
7                 And after the People rest and you put on your
8        case, we're going to have our charge conference, what we
9        discussed this morning.  The plan that we came up with this
10        morning and agreed to remains the same.
11                 After tomorrow, after the charge conference, you
12        will get the proposed jury charges I believe Thursday,
13        hopefully.  We'll be adjourned to Tuesday next week for
14        summations.  There is no prejudice to anyone.
15                 MR. BLANCHE:  May I have two minutes to talk to my
16        team and my client?
17                 THE COURT:  Sure.
18                 (Brief pause.)
19                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think we may be able to move
20        this process along.
21                 THE COURT:  Tell me.
22                 MR. STEINGLASS:  I think, if I understand what we
23        agreed about, the exhibit will come in through Mr. Cohen.
24        We will not call a paralegal, and we'll agree to the
25        following stipulation:

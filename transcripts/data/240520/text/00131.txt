13       Q    So, while you were employed at The Trump Organization
14   for the past five years or so, you were paid, including bonus,
15   just over 500,000 a year?
16       A    Correct.
17       Q    And the money that you have made since 2000, okay --
18   so the money you have made since 2000 is a lot more than
19   500,000 a year?
20       A    Correct.
21       Q    And the money that you made in 2017 when you were
22   President Trump's personal attorney greatly exceeded the
23   500,000 that you were paid every year by President Trump,
24   correct?
25       A    Correct.

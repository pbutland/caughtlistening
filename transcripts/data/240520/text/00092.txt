1       Q    What about Novartis?
2       Did you have a relationship with Novartis?
3       A    I did.
4       Q    They hired you in March of 2017; correct?
5       A    Correct.
6       Q    And they paid you $100,000 a month; correct?
7       A    Correct.
8       Q    And that was a one-year deal?
9       A    Correct.

16       Q    Well, if it was more than six, but not significant,

18       A    It could be six.
19       Q    So that would mean that you were paid $1.2 million for
20   six communications, that's $200,000 a communication; correct?
21       A    Correct.
22       Q    And that's the deal they entered into; right?
23       A    It is.
24       Q    And what I mean by that is when you hire -- when you

R. Costello - Cross/Hoffinger
4261
1       Q    So, you weren't interested in having him as your
2   client?
3       A    No, I wasn't.
4       Q    And so, you met with him, but you weren't interested in
5   retaining him; is that right?
6       A    I met with him because Jeff Citron made an arrangement
7   with Michael Cohen.
8       And he asked me to come along, because Jeff Citron is a real
9   estate attorney and this was, obviously, a criminal matter.
10       Q    So, you were just accompanying him to this meeting?
11       A    Well, I wouldn't say I was just accompanying him, it
12   was Jeff Citron's client, not mine.
13       Q    But I thought you said they knew each other, he wasn't
14   his client, I thought you said they knew each other?
15       A    Yes, Jeff Citron knew Michael Cohen for at least ten
16   years.
17       Q    So you knew at the time, based on the news, that
18   Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney;
19   correct?
20       A    I think I knew that before we entered the Regency
21   Hotel, yes.
22       Q    And if you could land him as a client, Personal
23   Attorney to the President, that would be a big case for your
24   firm; wouldn't it?
25       A    I suppose so.

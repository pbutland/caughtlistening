M. Cohen - Redirect/Hoffinger
4140
1                 MS. HOFFINGER:  You just said:  Correct?
2                 MR. BLANCHE:  3963.
3                 MS. HOFFINGER:  I have it right here.
4                 THE COURT:  Show it to me.
5                 MS. HOFFINGER:  It's a small version.  It's a
6        little hard to read without my glasses.  If you read that
7        line:  Is that correct?
8                 MR. BLANCHE:  I wasn't asking if it was truthful.
9        I was asking if the letter said it.
10                 MS. HOFFINGER:  That's why -- then he said a few
11        seconds later, "Is everything that you said in the letter
12        true?"  It left a misimpression.
13                 THE COURT:  3963.
14                 "But that is a true statement; right?
15                 "ANSWER:  That is a true statement.
16                 "QUESTION:  Meaning, you used your own funds to
17        make the payments to Ms. Daniels?
18                 "ANSWER:  Correct.
19                 "QUESTION:  And neither The Trump Organization nor
20        the campaign paid you back; right?
21                 "ANSWER:  It was a party to the transaction or
22        not."
23                 I am looking for the part where he asked whether
24        it was a campaign contribution.
25                 Do you have that?

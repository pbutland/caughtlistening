1   he said he talked to him about it more than 20 times --
2   that's, obviously, a key part of their story.
3            He confidently said that on October 24th, when he
4   had that call just after eight o'clock at night, the
5   purpose of the call was to call Keith Schiller, have
6   Mr. Schiller give the phone to President Trump and then --
7            THE COURT:  So you're asking me to find Mr. Cohen
8   not credible as a matter of law?
9            MR. BLANCHE:  Yes. Absolutely.
10            Because it wasn't just that lie, your Honor.
11            He also lied to this Court repeatedly, for
12   example, about his testimony in front of Congress and
13   whether he said that he never asked for a pardon.
14            It shouldn't move the Court that he continues to
15   lie about that?
16            I mean, the Court has the transcript. The Court
17   has the evidence, the testimony that he put in in front of
18   Congress where he says something that we know from the
19   testimony at this trial was not true.
20            And he still doubles down.
21            THE COURT:  So you want me to take it out of the
22   jury's hands and decide before it even gets to the jury
23   that, as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of
24   belief that it shouldn't be considered by the jury?
25   That's what you're asking?

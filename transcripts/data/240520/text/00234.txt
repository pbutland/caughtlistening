4            (Whereupon, the Court resumes the bench and the
5   proceedings continue.)
6            THE COURT:  So, Mr. Bove, you can definitely
7   cross-examine as to the two prior inconsistent statements,
8   obviously.
9            And I will give you some latitude to explore the
10   pressure campaign so that you can elicit some
11   inconsistencies, so you can offer some rebuttal of
12   Mr. Cohen's testimony.
13            But I'm not going to allow this to become a trial
14   within a trial as to whether or not there was, in fact, this
15   pressure campaign and how it affected Cohen.
16            That's not the purpose of this trial, and I don't
17   want it to become that.
18            As far as the retainer issue, that's collateral.
19   We don't need to go into that at all.
20            Okay.  All right.  Let's get the jury, please.
21            MR. BOVE:  Should we get the witness first, Judge?
22            THE COURT:  No.  The witness has not yet been sworn
23   in.
24            THE COURT OFFICER:  All rise.  Jury entering.
25            (Jury enters.)

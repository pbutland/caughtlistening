1                Step out, please.
2                Step out.
3                (The courtroom is cleared of people in the audience
4       by the court officers at this time.)
5                ******
6                THE COURT:  All right.
7                Let the record reflect that it's now five after
8       four.
9                Let the record also reflect that the court officers
10       had great difficulty clearing the courtroom, because the
11       courtroom is made up, primarily, of the press.
12                And I can appreciate that the press wants to be
13       present for every part of these proceedings.  Therefore,
14       this record is not sealed.  The press will have access to
15       this record.
16                The fact that I had to clear the courtroom and that
17       the court officers, including the Captain, had great
18       difficulty clearing the courtroom, and that there was
19       argument back and forth between the press and including
20       counsel for the press, goes to why I had to clear the
21       courtroom in the first place:
22                And that is, sir, your conduct is contemptuous
23       right now.
24                I'm putting you on notice that your conduct is
25       contemptuous.

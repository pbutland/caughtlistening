Colloquy

1 Those were his answers.
2 I asked him if he paid for it. That doesn't open
3 a door.
4 MS. HOFFINGER: You asked, all of that cash.
5 MR. BLANCHE: He said —— I said, how did you pay
6 him?
7 He said, I walked across the street to my bank,
8 and I took out cash.
9 THE COURT: I remember the testimony.
10 MR. BLANCHE: I didn’t ask that. It came out.
11 THE COURT: Sure. I will let you finish.
12 Go ahead.
13 MR. BLANCHE: No, Judge, it can’t be that I ask a
14 question that just has him saying I paid $20,000, and the
15 witness launches into a story about getting cash over three
16 or four days and putting it in a bag.
17 THE COURT: Mr. Steinglass brought the issue up.
18 I was expecting it.
19 I was expecting it because you asked many
20 questions about his $50,000, and the $20,000, and the
21 $30,000, and you —— you did.
22 You opened the door wide open.
23 I am going to allow it.

25 following occurred in open court.)

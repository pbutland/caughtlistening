1            But, this is hearsay, and we object.
2            THE COURT:  Give me one second to read it.
3            (Whereupon, the Court reviews the exhibit.)
4            MR. BLANCHE:  1005 is an email from
5   Mr. Costello's partner to Mr. Cohen following their
6   initial communications.
7            What Mr. Citron says to Mr. Cohen about what he
8   had talked to Mr. Costello about is they were very pleased
9   with the discussion, I know you have my cell, and that
10   you're involved on multiple fronts, I'm glad we can help
11   bring you some peace.
12            That is direct impeachment against what Mr. Cohen
13   testified to, both on direct and on cross, on Tuesday and
14   Thursday.
15            He testified that he didn't feel like he clicked
16   with Mr. Costello, they had given him an Engagement
17   Letter, and they were still working things out.
18            We are not offering this for the truth, but it's
19   certainly impeachment we can offer and cross him on it.
20            THE COURT:  It would be the truth of the
21   statement you're impeaching him with; right?
22            MR. BLANCHE:  Well, it depends how he answers it.
23            THE COURT:  Well, how he answers it, at that
24   point the cat is out of the bag, the jury heard it.
25            So, how do you get past the hearsay argument?

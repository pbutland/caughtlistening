1 So, your Honor said that that evidence would not
2 be permitted for consciousness of guilt for Mr. Trump.
3 What we're talking about here is Mr. Cohen’s

5 that purpose.
6 MR. BOVE: Our position —— and we’re seeking to
7 bring this out through the testimony of Mr. Costello —— is
8 that Mr. Cohen lied about his interactions with Bob
9 Costello, and he lied about his state of mind in this
10 timeframe, and that he very much wanted to be in touch
11 with Rudy Giuliani, to put questions to the President, to
12 try to extract information about the investigation.
13 This is very much a rebuttal of what the
14 Government believed, before they opened, was an important
15 part of their case.
16 And it also goes to the credibility of the star
17 witness.
18 And it’s admissible for all these reasons.
19 I understand, I would expect with any witness we
20 take it question by question to some extent.
21 Generally speaking, our theory of admissibility
22 is to rebut this pressure campaign concept and to put
23 into evidence that whatever is being said today about
24 Mr. Cohen's state of mind, what he said was his state of
25 mind in 2018 was false, because Mr. Costello will say it's

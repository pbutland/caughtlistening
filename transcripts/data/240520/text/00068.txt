M. Cohen — Cross/Blanche

1 The Trust; it would be with you and President Trump; right?
2 A Yes, but The Trust controlled his cash flow, so I would
3 suspect that somewhere along the line, maybe that's where the
4 funds would come from, I didn't know the answer.
5 Q I'm sorry,.
6 I didn't ask you where the funds would come from,.
7 I'm saying your attorney—client relationship, your Retainer
8 Agreement, that would have just been between you and President
9 Trump?
10 A Yes, sir.
11 Q That was my only question.
12 A Understood.
13 Q The payment could have come from, as it often does,
14 from other sources?
15 A Correct.
16 Q But, the attorney—client relationship and the Retainer
17 Agreement is between you and President Trump; right?
18 A Yes, sir.
19 Q But, that's not what happened here, right, because you
20 and Mr. Weisselberg decided that there would be no Retainer
21 Agreement; right?
22 A Hmmm. Can you rephrase the question?
23 Q I will withdraw the question.
24 I'm going to show you what has been marked as Defense
25 Exhibit D260 just for you, the parties and the Court.

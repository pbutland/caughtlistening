3                And Mr. Cohen testified that he was rendering
4       services for President Trump during that time, as his

9                Second, there is no evidence that there is any
10       intent to defraud by President Trump in connection with
11       these filings.

23       intent to defraud by President Trump when the invoices are
24       going to The Trump Organization, a check is being generated
25       for him to sign in the White House, for the President to

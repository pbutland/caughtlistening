1            MR. BLANCHE:  That his entire testimony should
2   not be considered by the jury. Absolutely. That's exactly
3   what we're asking the Court to do.
4            Again, we didn't just catch him in a lie, your
5   Honor. He came in here with a history of lying under oath.
6            Again, as your Honor ruled before this trial
7   started with respect to that issue, your Honor said,
8   correctly, that he hadn't appeared in front of you, so it
9   wouldn't be appropriate just based on past allegations of
10   lying under oath, it wouldn't be appropriate to just say
11   he can't testify.
12            He testified. And he lied under oath. In this
13   courtroom.
14            And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by
15   the jury, is that -- is a conviction, potentially.
16            And so, imagine the --
17            THE COURT:  You said his lies are "irrefutable;"
18   that you think he's going to fool 12 New Yorkers into
19   believing this lie?
20            MR. BLANCHE:  Well, Judge --
21            THE COURT:  It's an "irrefutable" lie?
22            MR. BLANCHE:  I certainly hope he doesn't
23   convince 12 jurors.
24            THE COURT:  I would like to hear from the People.
25            MR. COLANGELO:  The standard, as the Court knows,

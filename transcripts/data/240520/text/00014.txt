Proceedings
4005
1 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.
2 Thank you. And we appreciate the guidance.
3 1 think the challenge for us is, is that the
4 phrases that your Honor referred to, "For the purpose of
5 influencing an election" and the regulatory phrase that we
6 all described as the "Irrespective Rule", those are just
7 absolutely critical to the jury understanding the
8 Government's allegations in this case.
9 And so, coming into the trial, our plan and our
10 hope, based on your Honor's ruling, was that we would give
11 the jury guidance on those issues through Mr. Smith, on
12 the understanding —— on the understanding, your Honor,
13 that in The Trump Organization trial you had not
14 instructed the jury down to the level of a 175.10
15 predicate and, also, on the understanding that in pretrial
16 motion practice, I think under People v. Mackey, if 1
17 remember correctly, the Government had taken the same
18 position.
19 So, that was our strategy coming into the trial,
20 understanding that there is some tension in that strategy,
21 with us needing the jury to understand what those terms
22 mean, but also the traditional role of the Court in
23 telling the jury what legal terms mean.
24 I do think things changed a little bit when both
25 sides proposed additional instructions on FECA.

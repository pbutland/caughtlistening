THE CLERK: Calling People of the State of New York versus Donald J. Trump, Indictment Number 71543 of 2023. Appearances. Starting with the People.

MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, Assistant District Attorneys Joshua Steinglass, Susan Hoffinger, Matthew Colangelo, Becky Mangold, Christopher Conroy and Katherine Ellis. Good morning, everyone.

THE COURT: Good morning, People.

MR. BLANCHE: Good morning, your Honor. Todd Blanche for President Trump, who is seated to my left. I'm joined by Emil Bove, Kendra Wharton and Susan Necheles.

THE COURT: All right. Good morning, counsel. Good morning, Mr. Trump. Is there anything that we need to go over before we call a witness?

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes, please. May we approach?

THE COURT: Sure.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: At Sidebar.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: A couple of things, Judge. First of all, we had indicated that, potentially, that we would call another witness, that was going to be another book publisher, but we’ve decided that we really don’t need to do that. So, Mr. Cohen will be the last witness. Related to that, I don’t know how long Mr. Blanche’s cross—examination will be, but I think that it's highly likely that we will get to the defense case, such as it is, on Thursday. And we don’t know who the defense witnesses are, except for an expert witness and potentially Mr. Trump. They've indicated that the only other witnesses that they intend to call are impeachment witnesses. Under 245.20 (4)(b), we are entitled to know that at the end of whatever witness’ testimony they are seeking to impeach. So I understand that we haven’t gotten there yet with Michael Cohen, but if there are any other impeachment witnesses that they intend to call to impeach one or other of our witnesses, we would like to know who those witnesses are. I think we’re entitled to know who they are. Also, for planning purposes, we are entitled to have our potential rebuttal expert present for any expert testimony that they may proffer on their case. And so, we would like to know when the expert will testify so that we can make —— our expert is not local, so we can make travel arrangements, so that we don't have to have an unnecessary delay.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLANCHE: All fair. We do not have any rebuttal witnesses as of now.

THE COURT: You don't have any?

MR. BLANCHE: We do not have any rebuttal witnesses as of now, pending the testimony of Mr. Cohen. I believe the cross will continue until the end of the day Thursday. If it even finishes, it will be very near the end of the day and presumably there will be redirect. As for our expert, we have communicated with him and expect him to be here over the weekend. But whether we call him depends, in part, on the charge —— we submitted the charge, just this morning, so I know you haven't read it yet. And so, what we would hope to be able to do is to at least have some discussion about that before we begin our case, presumably, on Monday. Because, depending on the ruling, we may not call him.

THE COURT: That's a little tricky. I have to go back and read the CPL, I believe the pre—charge conference, while it comes before summation ——

MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

THE COURT: —— I think normally it comes at the end of the case. So you are kind of basing your evidence on what I decide as far as charges, and we may not know a final decision until we have the pre—charge conference.

MR. BLANCHE: Well, maybe I should rephrase. We —— if we can have an opportunity to argue or discuss what we anticipate our expert will testify to, get a ruling from the Court, your Honor already ruled, but there was some —— we believe, given where we are now, we at least need to address it again. So maybe it's not a charge conference.

THE COURT: Fine. We can do that.

MR. BLANCHE: My point is, I think they're travelling over the weekend. And as far as their expert, I don't believe that we would have him take the stand before Monday.

THE COURT: And do you have any indication whether your client is going to testify?

MR. BLANCHE: No.

THE COURT: No determination yet?

MR. BLANCHE: No.

MS. HOFFINGER: And you also gave us notice of Alan Garten.

MR. BLANCHE: No, we don't anticipate the calling of Alan Garten.

THE COURT: So, if I understand you correctly, your only witness on defense, that you know of right now, is the expert possibly?

MR. BLANCHE: Correct.

THE COURT: And maybe not.

MR. BLANCHE: And maybe not. Honestly, Judge, depending on how that conversation goes, because of the limited nature of his testimony, we may not call him.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLANCHE: And we will, obviously, let them know to save the flight of their expert.

THE COURT: Well, we can certainly have that conversation to assist you in making your decision.

MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely, sure.

MS. HOFFINGER: One other quick issue. We gave notice to defense counsel on Sunday of incidents that we intended to seek to admit with Mr. Cohen. There were —— defense counsel has not objected to any of them, but with respect to two, indicated that they would be seeking a limiting instruction. Those are two exhibits, one which is Mr. Cohen’s attorney’s letter in response to an FEC complaint and Mr. Cohen's public statement in response to an FEC complaint. And they’ve asked for a limiting instruction, I guess, along the lines of the prior instruction that your Honor gave. We do have a draft of that instruction. It’s not going to come up just yet, but a little bit later today, but we thought it made sense to perhaps go over it now.

THE COURT: Have you had a chance to review it?

MS. HOFFINGER: No. I just gave it to defense.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLANCHE: I need to do look it.

THE COURT: Once you look at it, and if you agree, to please let me know and also let me know when you want me to give it.

MR. BLANCHE: Also, your Honor, assuming that Mr. Cohen testifies this morning around his guilty plea for FECA, we would ask your Honor to give that limiting instruction. And I think we have a copy of it.

THE COURT: No, I have a copy of it.

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Sidebar concluded.

THE COURT: All right. May we get the witness, please.

THE COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The witness, Michael D. Cohen, enters the courtroom and resumed the witness stand.

THE COURT: Good morning. Mr. Cohen. I remind you that you are still under oath.

THE WITNESS: Yes, Sir.

THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Get the jury, please.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, that proposed charge is okay.

THE COURT: Okay. So I leave it to you to let me know when you would like me to give it.

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right.

THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. Jury entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury enters.

THE COURT: You may be seated.

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

MR. BLANCHE: Yes.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

THE COURT: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. People.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Good morning, Mr. Cohen.

A Good morning.

Q When we left off yesterday, we were talking about your meetings with Mr. Trump and Mr. Weisselberg concerning the plan for the reimbursements. Do you remember that?

A I do.

MS. HOFFINGER: I would like to please put up People’s 39 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize that email, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q Would you read it for the jury, please?

A It’s an email from Jeff McConney to me saying: "Mike" —— I’m sorry, on February 6th of 2017: "Mike, just a reminder to get me the invoice you spoke to Allen about. Thanks, Jeff."

Q And just as a reminder, what was Jeffrey McConney's job at the time?

A Controller.

Q And who did you report to?

A Allen Weisselberg.

Q And I think you mentioned yesterday that Mr. Weisselberg had discussed with you the invoices that you should send for the reimbursement payments?

A Yes.

Q And, at the point when you received this email, did you send the invoices right away or a little bit later?

A A little bit later.

Q Let me direct your attention now to a few days later, February 8th.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. You can take that down.

Q February 8th of 2017. Did you visit the White House on that day?

A I did.

Q And why —— while you were visiting the White House, did you have a private conversation with then President Trump?

A I did.

Q First, where did the conversation take place?

A In the Oval Office.

Q Did you discuss in the Oval Office the reimbursement payments that were going to be made to you?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Can you tell the jury a bit about that conversation?

A So I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was okay. He asked me if I needed money, and I said, no, all good. He said, because I can get a check. And I said, no. I said, I'm okay. He said, ummm, all right, just make sure you deal with Allen.

Q Did he say anything about anything that would be forthcoming?

A Excuse me?

Q Did he say anything about what would be forthcoming to you?

A Yes. It would be a check for January and February.

Q And so, at that point in time, you had not yet been reimbursed for the payments that you made to Stormy Daniels?

A No, ma'am.

Q And did you take any photos commemorating your visit to the White House?

A I did.

Q Why did you do that?

A Visiting the White House.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's 253 in evidence, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize that photo, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q And can you tell the jurors when you took that photo and where you were?

A On the same day, and that's in the briefing room right outside of the Oval Office.

Q And did you take that photo before you met with President Trump or after you met with him?

A No, ma'am, after.

Q Now, did you also put a page in your electronic calendar indicating that you had a meeting with the President of the United States on that day?

A I did.

Q And do you always put meetings and appointments in your electronic calendar?

A No, ma'am.

Q Why did you put one in that day?

A So if —— to commemorate seeing President Trump at the White House.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up now, please, People's 254 in evidence.

Q What does POTUS stand for?

A President of the United States.

Q And is that an exact copy of your electronic calendar, that appointment?

A Yes, ma'am, it is.

MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down.

Q Now, about a week after your meeting with President Trump at the White House, did Mr. McConney send you another email reminding you about the invoices?

A He did.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's 37A in evidence, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And can we go to Page 3 of the email from ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Can you make that a little bit bigger.

Q Now, can you —— is this a response that you see on your screen to the prior email that we saw from Mr. McConney reminding you to send the invoices that you had spoken to Allen about?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And would you read that for the jury and just the date and who it's from and to?

A So this is from me to Jeff McConney, on February 14th, of 2017, regarding two dollar signs. "Jeff, sorry for the delay, and thank you for the reminder. Please have the monthly checks for January and February made payable to Michael D. Cohen, Esquire and sent to..... hope you are well and see you soon."

Q And you didn't reference invoices here, just that they should send you the checks?

A Correct.

Q Why is that?

A Because there was no need. There was no invoice.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we scroll up now to Mr. McConney's response to Mr. Cohen's email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you want to read that?

A That's from Jeff McConney to me on February 14th of 2017. "Mike, please send me invoices so I can have the checks cut. Thanks, Jeff."

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we now put up Mr. Cohen's response to that email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A From me to Jeff. Again, Tuesday, February 14th, regarding the two dollar signs. "Jeff, please remind me of the monthly amount?"

Q At that point, had you —— did you not have —— why were you asking for the monthly amount?

A I actually didn't remember it. I didn't have a copy of the document that I had worked on with Allen Weisselberg and then presented to Mr. Trump.

Q If you had a Retainer Agreement, would it have had a monthly amount in it?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q But there was no Retainer Agreement?

A No, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Mr. Cohen's response to invoice.

Q And can you describe for the jury, what’s on the screen?

A This is my email to McConney —— Jeff, on the same day, February 14th of 2017. I created an invoice, put Michael D. Cohen Esquire. There was an address, dated February 14th. And I called the document invoice. I sent it to Allen Weisselberg, care of —— and I sent it by email, care of Donald J. Trump, 725 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, 10022. Stating: "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the months of January and February, 2017." Then I indicate for January, 2017, $35,000 fee. And for February, 2017, the same $35,000 amount. "Thank you. Michael Cohen."

Q And, thereafter, did you send monthly invoices, essentially similar, to this invoice?

A Yes, I copied and pasted.

Q And was this invoice consistent with the directions that you had been given by Allen Weisselberg?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Now, the invoice here says "For services rendered." The date here is —— what is the date on this invoice?"

A February 14th of 2017.

Q And does the invoice say that it's for not only services rendered in the month of January, but also services rendered for the month of February of 2017?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And, in truth, was this invoice for any services that you had rendered for those two months as indicated pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A No, ma'am.

Q And the description of "pursuant to a Retainer Agreement," was that a truthful statement?

A No, ma'am.

Q And for "services rendered," was that a truthful statement?

A No, ma'am.

Q What was the true purpose of this invoice and the subsequent invoices that you sent?

A The reimbursement to me of the hush money fee along with the Red Finch and the bonus.

Q Was this invoice a false record?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And did you continue to submit similar false invoices through the month —— monthly, through the month of December of 2017 so that you would receive those checks?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And did each of those monthly invoices that you submitted make the same false representation that it was rendered —— it was for services rendered for the month in question pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And on each of the occasions that you sent those invoices, who were they directed to?

A Allen Weisselberg.

Q And how did you submit them to Mr. Weisselberg?

A Via email.

Q And who were the emails to?

A Allen Weisselberg.

Q Were they emailed to anyone else other than Mr. Weisselberg?

A Maybe also to Jeff McConney on occasion.

Q And have you had an opportunity to review each of the 11 invoices and the accompanying emails that you submitted to Allen Weisselberg, and on some occasions also to Jeff McConney, that are contained in People’s Exhibits 37 A through K?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And, in truth, were any of those invoices that you submitted based on services performed for the months indicated pursuant to a Retainer Agreement?

A No, ma’am. They were for reimbursement.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look, please —— actually, withdrawn.

Q In response to those 11 false invoices, similar to this one that you sent, did you receive seven checks in the year 2017 totaling $420,000?

A I'm sorry, how many checks?

Q Eleven. A total of 11 checks in the year 2017 totaling $420,000?

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: And can we now put up People's Exhibit 4 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you tell the jury what this is, referring to Exhibit 4?

A This is a check that was sent to me for $70,000, which was for the month of January of 2017 and for the month of February 2017, along with the stub that came with it.

Q So when you received this check, it had a stub attached to it?

A One of the stubs.

Q And this was in response to the invoice that you sent that we just looked at, People's 37A?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And I want to direct your attention to the check stub.

MS. HOFFINGER: If you could blow up one of the check stubs.

Q It says "Retainer for January 1, 2017 through January 30th, 2017, and retainer for February 1, 2017 through February 28th, 2017." Again, was there a retainer —— was this a retainer for those months?

A No, ma'am.

Q And was the check —— were the descriptions here on this check stub false?

A Yes.

Q And, again, there was no Retainer Agreement; is that right?

A That's correct.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at the signature on the check now. Blow that up.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize the signatures on the check?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Whose do you recognize them to be?

A The one on the top, I believe, is Eric Trump's, and the one on the bottom is Allen Weisselberg.

Q And who is the check from? In other words, what account is it drawn on?

A The check is drawn from Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust account.

Q And at the time, did you know who the beneficial owner was of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Who was that?

A Donald J. Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. You can take that down. Can we now take a look at People's Exhibit 37B in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. HOFFINGER: And if we could blow up the top of that. Thank you.

Q Can you tell us the date of that invoice?

A February 16th of 2017.

Q Take a look at the body of the invoice, and could you just let us know if that date at the top, February 16th, was a typo?

A Yes, it is.

Q What was it meant to be?

A March.

Q And could you —— can you please just read what's in the invoice?

A Yes. I probably should have copied and pasted better. This is an email from me to Jeff McConney and CC'd —— well, I should say as well as to Allen Weisselberg. And the body states: "Invoice." To Allen Weisselberg, care of Donald J. Trump, again at 725 Fifth Avenue. New York, New York 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of March, 2017." Then again stating: "March, 2017 $35,000. Thank you. Yours."

Q And, in fact, was this payment for services rendered for the month of March pursuant to the Retainer Agreement?

A No, ma'am.

Q Was that invoice false?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Thank you.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's Exhibit 7, please.

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Do you recognize the signatures ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. Can you blow up the check.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize the signatures on this check?

A I do.

Q Whose signatures are they?

A I believe the top one is Don Junior's —— Donald J. Trump, Jr. And the bottom is, again, Allen Weisselberg.

Q Thank you.

MS. HOFFINGER: We can take that down. Can we now put up People's 37C in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. HOFFINGER: Maybe blow it up a little bit.

Q And, Mr. Cohen, can you read it. The year and date?

A The date is April 13th of 2017. It’s to Allen Weisselberg. Care of Donald J. Trump, 725 Fifth Avenue. New York, New York 10022. "Dear Allen, pursuant to the Retainer Agreement, kindly remit payment for services rendered for the month of April, 2017." Again, it’s showing: "April, 2017 $35,000. Thank you."

Q Does this invoice falsely state that it’s payment for services rendered during the month of April pursuant to the Retainer Agreement?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Is that a false record?

A Yes, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please take that down and put up People’s Exhibit 10.

MS. HOFFINGER: And can we just blow up the stub.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And can you read what the description says?

A The description states retainer 4/1 through 4/30 of 2017.

Q In truth, was that check paid to you as a retainer for that month of April 2017?

A No, ma'am. Again, reimbursement.

Q And so, was the description on the check stub false?

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we look at the signature on the check, please.

A Yes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize that signature?

A I do.

Q Whose signature is it?

A Donald J. Trump.

Q And were you able to recognize it based on your experience working for him all those years?

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: We can take that down. Thank you.

Q Now, did you receive a total of eight more monthly checks for $35,000, each signed by Mr. Trump, corresponding to the monthly false invoices that you sent contained in People's 37D through K?

A I did.

Q And those eight monthly checks that you received, were they all accompanied by check stubs that falsely stated they were retainers for the months in question?

A Yes.

Q And were any of those checks, in fact, for work during the months described in those check stubs?

A No, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look, please, at 37D.

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 13.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Did you receive that check for $35,000 in response to the false invoice that we just saw for People's 37D?

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we pull up one of the check stubs, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Does that check stub say Retainer, May 1st —— does it say "May, 2017?"

A Yes, ma'am.

Q I apologize, it's hard for me to read it from here. And, again, was this check paid to you as a retainer for that month?

A No, ma'am.

Q Was the description on this check stub false?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Can you just take a look at the signature on the check, please.

It listed, again, "May, 2017 $35,000" and "June of 2017, $35,000. Thank you."

Q Now, you listed two months in that. Is that because you had not yet received the check for May?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Thank you.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please pull up People's Exhibit 34 now.

A Yes.

A Again, it was because the full reimbursement of the $420,000 had been paid.

Q Thank you.

MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. Can we now pull up People's Exhibit 42 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we scroll down just a little bit so that Mr. Cohen can recognize this exhibit.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Mr. Cohen, have you had a chance to review the 11 checks that are contained in here, in this exhibit totaling $420,000?

A I have.

Q Were all 11 checks received by you and deposited and the amounts reflected in the checks paid out to you?

A Yes, ma'am.

MS. HOFFINGER: We can take that down. Thank you very much.

Q Now, after the last check was sent to you in December of 2017, I think you mentioned, you never received any other checks from Mr. Trump or from his Trust; is that right?

A That's correct.

Q Or from The Trump Organization?

A Also correct.

Q I want to talk to you a little bit about the work that you did in 2017, any work that you did with respect to your role as Personal Attorney and Personal Counsel to President Trump. Did you do, in the year 2017, any work for Mr. Trump or for his wife Melania Trump?

A Minimal.

Q And can you just give us some examples of the minimal work that you did in 2017 for them?

A There was a matter that dealt with an individual by the name of Summer Zervos. I was working with Marc Kasowitz on that, and so I had spoken with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and provided him some documents that Mr. Kasowitz had given to me to pass along. As far as Melania, I think it had to do with some trademarks or maybe even a Madame Tussauds Agreement.

Q So, let's break both of those down. In terms of the work that you did for Mrs. Trump related to Madame Tussauds or the trademark, what was the —— can you characterize the extent of that work for Mrs. Trump?

A I reviewed an Agreement that Madame Tussauds sent to her that was to create her likeness and image for their museum.

Q Was it a substantial amount of time that you spent on that?

A No, ma'am.

Q And did you send a bill or an invoice to Mr. Trump or to The Trump Organization for that work?

A No, ma'am.

Q Why not?

A Well, one, I —— I didn't expect to be paid on it. But, it wasn't enough work to have me send an invoice.

Q And you mentioned Summer Zervos. Who was handling that matter, substantially, for Mr. Trump?

A Marc Kasowitz.

Q So that was an outside attorney, not yourself?

A Correct.

Q How would you characterize the amount of work that you did generally on that matter, if any?

A Very minimal.

Q Did you ever bill Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization for that minimal work that you said that you did on that?

A No, ma'am.

Q Why not?

A Again, it wasn't any substantial work. Mr. Kasowitz was actually doing the work on that. Plus I didn't expect to be paid.

Q Now, from time to time, did —— withdrawn. From time to time, did you receive some emails from Alan Garten, who was the General Counsel of The Trump Organization, about particular matters here and there that he might want you to look into?

A Yes.

Q And did you consider that work that he sent you legal work?

A No.

Q And regardless of what type of work it was, in terms of things that he sent you, what was the extent of any work that you did on those matters?

A Also minimal.

Q And did you send a bill or an invoice either to Mr. Trump or to The Trump Organization for that work?

A No, ma'am.

Q And why not?

A Because, the same reasons as stated, I didn't expect to be paid and it was very minimal work.

Q If you had to characterize or estimate the number of hours that you spent in the year 2017 doing any sort of work, legal or these quasi—legal matters, what would be the total number of hours that you would estimate?

A Less than ten.

Q Now, did you bill for any of those matters?

A No, ma'am.

Q Was the $420,000 that you received from Mr. Trump and from the Revocable Trust, did that have anything to do with the minimal amount of work that you did for Mr. Trump in 2017?

A No, ma'am.

Q Now, did you continue —— for a period of months in 2018, did you continue to hold the title of Personal Attorney or Personal Counsel to President Trump?

A I did.

Q And did you do any legal work for Mr. Trump in 2018?

A Yes.

Q Can you describe, generally, for the jury, the type of work that you did in 2018?

A As a result of the Stormy Daniels matter and her electing to go public, Mr. Trump wanted an action to be filed in —— an arbitration action to be filed against her for the breach of the Non—Disclosure Agreement. And so I was contacted by Eric Trump, as well as I spoke to Mr. Trump regarding how to go forward with this arbitration proceeding.

Q Were you directed to work with outside counsel on that issue?

A Yes.

Q Who was that?

A That would be Larry Rosen.

Q And did you work on that matter with Larry Rosen in the year 2018?

A Yes.

Q Comparatively, did you do more work in 2018, more legal work in 2018 for Mr. Trump, or more in 2017?

A It would be more in 2018.

Q Did you get paid anything in 2018 from Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization?

A No, ma'am.

Q And did you bill for any of the work that you did for Mr. Trump in 2018?

A No, ma'am.

Q Now, I wanted to go back to something that you said, that you testified about yesterday, and that was monetizing the title of Personal Attorney or Personal Counsel to the President. In 2017 and 2018, did that title assist you in getting other clients?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And was that your plan all along for seeking that title, and that was, to be able to attract clients based on your role?

A Yes.

Q In 2017 and 2018, approximately how many clients did you have, doing work for them?

A Five.

Q And what kind of work, generally, did you do for those clients?

A Consulting, advisory.

Q Was there any legal work involved in any of those clients during the year 2018?

A No, ma'am.

Q Now, over the course of 2017 and 2018, approximately how much money in total did you earn from those clients that you worked for?

A Approximately $4 million.

Q Did you also, as a result, have an agreement with a law firm here in New York named Squire Patton Boggs?

A I did.

Q Can you explain a little bit about that?

A Well, I was contacted by one of the managing partners of the firm and they were interested in having me on their letterhead because of the title, "Personal Attorney to the President," as well as being able to levy my contacts to help them to generate business. And I created a working relationship with them, an of counsel relationship with them.

Q And approximately how much did Squire Patton Boggs pay you?

A It was bifurcated, the Agreement. It was half a million dollars, and the first half a million dollars of income that was generated would come to me, everything thereafter until they received their 1 million back would go to them.

Q And did you also have an office there at Squire Patton Boggs?

A Two offices. I had one here in Manhattan and one in Washington, D.C.

Q Now, approximately, how long did you hold the title of Personal Counsel or Personal Attorney to the President?

A Approximately 15 months.

Q And during the time when you were Personal Counsel to the President, did you continue to try to protect him?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And during the time that you served as Personal Counsel to the President, did you continue to lie for him?

A Yes.

Q Why did you do that?

A Out of loyalty and in order to protect him.

Q And at the time he was President; is that right?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q And had he already announced that he was going to be running again for President in 2020?

A He had stated so.

Q Now, I want to direct your attention to the Fall of 20 —— actually, the Spring and Fall 2017. During the time when you were still personal counsel to President Trump, around that time, did the House and Senate Intelligence Committees request that you provide them with information and appear before them and testify in connection with the Russia investigation?

A They did.

Q And were you subpoenaed to provide testimony?

A Yes.

Q Describe, just briefly, what you understood those inquiries to be about?

A It was about the Trump Tower Moscow deal and Russia connections to the campaign.

Q What, if any, pressure did you feel at the time that you were under in connection with that?

A A tremendous amount of pressure. It was the first time I had ever been subpoenaed by Congress to come in to testify.

Q Did you have an attorney representing you at the time in connection with your statements and your testimony to Congress?

A I did.

Q And who was paying for that attorney?

A The Trump Organization.

Q Was that important to you at the time that The Trump Organization was paying for your attorney?

A Very much so.

Q Was your attorney also part of something called a Joint Defense Agreement?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Can you explain a little bit to the jury what that is?

A So the Joint Defense Agreement is when there is several different lawyers representing, obviously, different people and they are all working together for a common goal.

Q At the time, what, if anything, did you feel about wanting the power of the President to protect you in this matter?

A I felt I needed it. It was extremely important to me.

Q Did you make false statements to Congress in 2017 in connection with the written statement that you submitted and your testimony?

A I did.

Q Generally, what did those false statements relate to?

A They dealt with The Trump Tower Moscow real estate project, specifically the number of times that I claimed to have spoken to Mr. Trump about the project, as well as the time period for those conversations.

Q What, essentially, did you communicate to Congress in terms of the time period?

A I told them that it was a truncated time period and that I had only spoken to Mr. Trump about this project three times.

Q And, in truth, how many times had you?

A Ten times.

Q And did you also communicate to them that it was —— that those communications stopped at an earlier date than they actually did?

A Yes.

Q Why did you make those false statements to Congress?

A Because I was staying on Mr. Trump's message that there was no Russia—Russia—Russia and, again, in coordination with the Joint Defense Team, that's what was preferred.

Q Now, let me direct your attention to the early months of 2018. Did you continue to lie about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

A Yes.

Q And did you continue to pressure other people, for example, like Keith Davidson, to lie about the payoffs to Karen McDougal and to Stormy Daniels?

A Yes.

Q Why did you do that?

A In order to protect Mr. Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 181 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Now, in early —— do you see in front of you an article from the Wall Street Journal regarding the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

A Yes.

Q Just prior to this article coming out, did you learn from reporters for the Wall Street Journal that they were going to be running or publishing a story about the Stormy Daniels payoff?

A Yes.

Q When the story came out, did you —— or was coming out, did you comment publicly regarding these allegations?

A I did.

Q Did you comment to reporters?

A I did.

Q And to others?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q At the time, in early 2018, did you tell the truth about Mr. Trump's role in the payoff?

A No, ma'am.

Q And did you tell the truth about his involvement in the payoff and the fact that he had repaid you for the payments you made to Stormy Daniels?

A No.

Q Now, did you continue to be in touch with President Trump during this time in early 2018?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q How, generally, did you reach him in early 2018?

A I would reach him, generally, by contacting Madeleine Westerhout and expressed to Westerhout —— and expressed to her that I would like to speak to Mr. President or I would call him on his cell phone.

Q Who was Madeleine Westerhout at the time?

A She was a White House Secretary for —— that basically sat outside Mr. Trump’s —— outside the Oval Office.

Q Now, during this time period, did you discuss with President Trump the statements that you were going to be releasing publicly in early 2018, meaning, statements that he did not know or was not involved in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

A Yes.

Q In substance, what did you tell him about the statements that you were going to be releasing or issuing about the Stormy Daniels matter?

A That I had paid the money on his behalf without his knowledge because —— just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t hurt you, and that I did it.

Q And you did it without his knowledge, did you say?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q What, generally, did he —— how, generally, did he respond to you letting him know that?

A Well, That's good. Good.

Q Now, in January of 2018, were you in contact with Keith Davidson about this article that was going to be coming out in the Wall Street Journal?

A Yes.

Q What did you discuss with him?

A How this statement —— how the story had gotten out. I was angered and I was concerned.

Q And what did you ask him to do in response?

A Obtain a denial from Ms. Daniels.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 255 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize these text exchanges, Mr. Cohen, and who they are with?

A I do.

Q Who were they with?

A Let me see. Keith Davidson.

MS. HOFFINGER: And can we take a look at the texts on January 10th of 2018.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And perhaps you can read those for the jury.

A It's from Keith Davidson to me. It's dated January 10th of 2018. "Wall Street Journal called Stormy. She didn't answer. They say they are running a story and have a deadline of tonight for her to comment."

Q And can you read your response, please, to the jury?

A I apologize. It's October 20th of 2018. My response to ——

Q Actually, just to correct ——

A January 10th of 2018.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce—Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Continued from the previous page.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Did you pressure Keith Davidson to have Stormy Daniels sign a denial?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Why did you do that?

A To protect Mr. Trump.

Q And did Keith Davidson end up providing you with such a statement by Ms. Daniels?

A He did.

Q Before we look at that, I want to follow up on one question I asked you about the Joint Defense Agreement. Was Mr. Trump and his lawyer also part of that Joint Defense Agreement?

A Yes, ma’am. They were.

Q And who was benefiting from the Joint Defense Agreement?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, the objection is because it calls for a legal conclusion.

A Joint Defense Agreement is a formal agreement amongst lawyers. And so, asking who benefits from it, assuming he is going to say President Trump, that’s just not consistent with what the Joint Defense Agreement is. Every Defendant in it ——

MS. HOFFINGER: I can ask a better question, which is: What was his understanding?

THE COURT: Okay.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

Q Mr. Cohen, what was your understanding about who benefited from the Joint Defense Agreement?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A I believe several people would benefit, but certainly President Trump.

Q And did you understand that you also benefited?

A Yes, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Now, can we please put up People’s 277 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q We were discussing that you pressured Keith Davidson to have Ms. Daniels issue a statement. Do you remember that testimony?

A I do.

Q And do you recognize this document?

A I do.

Q What do you recognize it to be?

A This is the statement that Keith Davidson had sent to me in regards to the denial that I requested him to send.

Q And when he —— after you received this from Mr. Davidson, who did you send it to?

A I sent it to Hope Hicks, I believe.

Q Do you know when you sent it?

A I am sorry. I sent it to The Wall Street Journal. I sent it to several people, but yes.

Q Did you know that this statement from Stormy Daniels was false?

A Yes.

Q Now, did you tell Mr. Trump that you were going to be getting or had gotten such a denial statement from Ms. Daniels?

A Yes.

Q Why did you tell him that?

A Well, one, to get credit for expressing that I was continuing to ensure that he was protected, stay loyal and the other so that I —— we can have this matter taken care of.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up now People's 255 in evidence? And can we blow up the texts from January 17th of 2018?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Now, Mr. Cohen, did you ask Mr. Daniels —— withdrawn. Did you ask Mr. Davidson to have Ms. Daniels appear on the Hannity Show, the Sean Hannity Show on Fox during this time?

A I did.

Q Why did you do that?

A Because I wanted to continue to promote the statement that there was no relationship and that Trump had no involvement.

MS. HOFFINGER: And can we scroll down to a few more of these text exchanges? You can stop there.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q After your text, can you read Keith Davidson’s response?

A Yes. His response to me is: She cannot. Don’t today. She is flying to L.A. tomorrow. I’m trying to get her to commit for tomorrow.

Q And your response?

A It’s really important. Why?

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we scroll down to the next one?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A I didn’t get a response, or the response I was looking for. So, I asked him to please call me: Can you call me, please? I still didn’t hear from him so, I respond again: Please call me.

Q Then?

A Then followed by: Anything? With a question mark. And his response finally to me: Was still trying.

Q And the next text.

A And I then followed up and said: This is no good. We need her as —— by doing tomorrow. You just create another news circle instead of putting an end to this one. And then, again, I am asking him to please call me. And persistence: Come on. I still hadn’t heard from him. I then respond: Let’s forget tonight. They would rather tomorrow so they can promote the heck out of the show. Followed by me writing to Keith: Keith, the wise men all believe the story is dying and don’t think it’s smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone. His response to me: 100 percent. I respond: Thanks Pal. As well as: Just no interviews or statements unless through you. He replies: Got it.

Q Did Ms. Daniels end up going on the Sean Hannity Show?

A No, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we now put up People’s 278 in evidence, please?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Now, later in the month of January, January 30th of 2018, did you make more efforts to get Keith Davidson to have Stormy Daniels issue another denial statement?

A Yes.

Q Why did you do that?

A Because despite what we thought was dying, the story dying, there were still persistent reporters that were looking into this. And I felt an official statement from her, another one, would be helpful to putting an end to it.

Q Do you also recall that around that same time there was some news that she might go on the Jimmy Kimmel Show?

A Yes.

Q And so, did you pressure Keith Davidson to have her sign this statement?

A I did.

Q In fact, did he provide that statement to you from Stormy Daniels?

A He did.

Q Did you know at the time that this statement was false?

A Yes.

Q How did you know?

A Because I helped him craft it.

Q In addition, does the statement say that she was not paid any hush money?

A Yes.

Q How do you know that she had been paid that money?

A Because I am the one who paid it.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. You can take that down.

Q Now, at some point again in 2018, early 2018, did you receive a letter, a complaint letter, from the Federal Election Commission regarding your payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels?

A I did.

Q And did you have an attorney prepare a letter on your behalf in response to that complaint?

A I did.

Q And what law firm and what lawyer?

A That was from McDermott, Will and Emery. The attorney was Stephen Ryan.

Q And who was paying for McDermott, Will and Emery’s work and for Stephen Ryan’s time at the time?

A The Trump Organization.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show just to the witness, please, and to counsel and to the Court, People’s Exhibit 201 for identification?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q What do you recognize it to be?

A This is the letter that was drafted by counsel, myself to the Federal Election Commission in response to what's identified as MUR7313. That’s the Complaint Number.

Q And is that an exact copy of the letter that your attorney submitted on your behalf to the FEC?

A It is.

Q And did you authorize him to submit that letter?

A I did.

MS. HOFFINGER: The People offer, your Honor, People’s Exhibit 201 in evidence.

MR. BLANCHE: No objection.

THE COURT: Accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Document so received in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you read, please, the second paragraph of that letter for the jury?

A In a private transaction in 2016 before the United States Presidential Election, Mr. Cohen used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford. Neither The Trump Organization, nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment directly or indirectly.

Q Was that statement false or misleading?

A Misleading.

Q And can you explain to the jury why it is misleading?

A So, while crafting the statement, we elected to state neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction. That is a true statement, but it’s deceptive. It’s misleading.

Q Can you explain why it’s misleading?

A Well, because it was neither The Trump Org., or the Trump campaign. It was the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust or Mr. Trump himself.

Q And you omitted that in the letter?

A I omitted it.

Q And did you intend for it to be misleading?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Why?

A In order to protect Mr. Trump. To stay on message. To demonstrate my continued loyalty.

Q And did you speak to Mr. Trump about the FEC Complaint when you received it in February of 2018?

A I did.

Q And did he approve, in substance, with your statement which would omit his involvement in the matter?

A He did.

Q And did he approve your sending out such a response to the press as well?

A Yes, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look at People’s Exhibit 260 in evidence?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize what’s contained in this exhibit, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q What is it?

A These are text messages between myself and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times?

Q And when you say of The New York Times, who is Maggie Haberman?

A She is a reporter for The New York Times.

Q And did you have her telephone numbers and emails in your phone contacts?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Except for the redactions here, is this an exact copy of some of the text communications you had with her on February 6th of 2018?

A It is.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the text on February 6th of 2018?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And, Mr. Cohen, can you read them?

A So, this is from February 6th of 2018, from me to Maggie Haberman, stating: Big Boss just approved me responding to complaint and statement. Please start writing and I will call you soon.

Q Who is the, Big Boss, that you were referring to in that text with Maggie Haberman?

A President Donald Trump.

Q What did you mean by this text?

A That he approved the statement and that —— and my response to the complaint and asking her to start writing a story in regard to the denial.

Q And were you intending to provide her with the statement about the matter?

A Yes. I was going to give it to her first so she had the scoop.

Q And did you then also prepare a written statement for the press to be released in connection with that FEC Complaint?

A Yes.

MS. HOFFINGER: And can we now please show just to the witness, counsel and to the Court, People’s Exhibit 202 for identification.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this document, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q What is it?

A This is the statement that I was releasing to the press.

Q And is this an exact copy of the statement that you released publicly to the press around February 13th of 2018?

A Yes, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: I offer People’s Exhibit 202 in evidence, your Honor.

MR. BLANCHE: No objection, Judge. We respectfully request the instruction with respect to the letter and the statement.

THE COURT: Why don’t we introduce it into evidence? It is accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Document so received in evidence.

MS. HOFFINGER: And should we have him read it first and then the instruction?

THE COURT: Yes. Yes.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Could you please read the first —— actually, the first line in the second paragraph?

A I am Mr. Trump’s long—time special counsel, and I have proudly served in that role for more than a decade.

Q Why did you write that line?

A To validate the statement that I was going to be sending out that I wanted them to run with and because it was Mr. Trump.

Q And could you please read the paragraph that starts: In a private transaction?

A In a private transaction in 2016, I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford. Neither The Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly. The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.

Q Now, was that statement false?

THE COURT: Ms. Hoffinger. Mr. Blanche, is this the point you ——

MR. BLANCHE: Oh, yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Jurors, you have just heard testimony that the Federal Election Commission, the FEC, conducted an investigation into the payment to Stormy Daniels and the responses thereto submitted by Michael Cohen and his attorney. This evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Michael Cohen’s credibility and to help provide context of some of the surrounding events. You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Neither the fact of the FEC investigation nor the responses thereto constitute evidence of the Defendant's guilt, and you may not consider them in determining whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: You are welcome.

BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Was the statement that you just read false or misleading?

A Yes.

Q And for the same reasons that you described concerning your lawyer’s response to the FEC Complaint?

A Yes.

Q And there is an additional line here that you read that says ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Can you blow that up one more time?

Q There is an additional line at the bottom that says: The payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution or campaign expenditure by anyone. Was that a false statement?

A It was my drawing a legal conclusion, which is inaccurate.

Q Now, can you read the second to last line in —— thank you —— in the next paragraph. Can you read that to us, please?

A I do not plan to provide any further comment on the PEG matter or regarding Ms. Clifford.

Q And why did you write that?

A Because I realized that once you send this to the press, that they are smarter than just to notice The Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. That they would ask additional questions such as: Well, did it come from Mr. Trump? Did it come from somebody else? And I wanted to just preface it to them: This is the statement you are going to get from me to run with and that I have no intentions to continue to comment on the matter.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we also just blow up the last line in the letter.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And would you read that to the jury?

A Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump.

Q And why did you write that?

A Because it was a statement that validated what was in the second paragraph about me providing my own personal funds to facilitate the payment. And the last line: I will always protect Mr. Trump, was to validate that specific line.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. You can take that down.

Q Now, around that same time that you released that statement —— that you were going to be releasing that statement to the press publicly, did you also provide that statement to someone named Jay Sekulow?

A I did.

Q Who was Jay Sekulow at the time?

A He was representing Mr. Trump.

Q And is he an attorney?

A He is.

Q And explain why you sent that public statement that you were going to send out to Mr. Sekulow?

A I was referred to Mr. Sekulow, actually, by Sean Hannity to speak about this FEC Complaint. And I was instructed to by Mr. Trump, to keep in touch with Jay Sekulow because he was in contact with Mr. Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look now, just for the witness, the Court and defense counsel, please, People’s Exhibit 217 for identification?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize that document, Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q What is it?

A This is a communication between myself and Jay Sekulow.

Q And does the communication reflect the use of an encrypted app called Signal?

A It is.

Q And are these screenshots of Signal communications with Mr. Sekulow?

A Yes.

Q And is this an exact screenshot or photo —— exact copies of communications you had with Mr. Sekulow at the time reflected in this record?

A Yes, ma’am.

MS. HOFFINGER: At this time, I offer People's Exhibit 217 in evidence.

MR. BLANCHE: No objection.

THE COURT: 217 is accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Document is so received in evidence.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put that on the screen for everyone and blow up the communication on February 19th of 2018?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you read that communication? Who was that communication from?

A This is from me to Jay Sekulow. I apologize, from Jay Sekulow to me.

Q Was this after you sent him the public statement that you were going to be making about the FEC Complaints?

A Yes. Yes.

Q Can you read in what Mr. Sekulow wrote to you?

A He says: Client says thanks for what you do.

Q And what is your understanding about who he was referring to when he was referring to, client?

A Client here is referred as President Donald Trump. And, for what you do, that dealt with the statement that I was putting out to the press on the FEC.

Q You’re denying his involvement?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Now, also in February of '18, 2018, did you —— withdrawn. Around the same time in February of 2018, did The Wall Street Journal reach out to you about an article they were going to write concerning AMI's payoff of Karen McDougal?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And, actually, specifically, did they reach out to you about a FEC Complaint about AMI’s payoff of Karen McDougal?

A Yes.

Q And do you recall what The Wall Street Journal was asking you about in connection with that?

A AMI’s participation in the payoff.

Q And were they asking you also about anybody else's involvement in that payoff, other than AMI?

A David Pecker.

Q Were they asking at all about your involvement or Mr. Trump's involvement?

A Yes.

Q Did you speak to Mr. Pecker around that time about the PEG Complaint that AMI had received?

A Yes.

Q Can you tell the jury about, generally, what was discussed between yourself and Mr. Pecker?

A So, David was very concerned because it was going to affect AMI. It was going to affect him. And so, I had told him that I would assist with this matter. And I, ultimately, told him that after conversations with the President, do not worry. We have this thing under control. It’s going to be taken care of.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, may I speak to counsel for one minute?

THE COURT: Sure.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Ms. Hoffinger and Mr. Blanche confer.

MR. BLANCHE: May we briefly approach, your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.

MR. BLANCHE: I am not trying to disrupt the flow. I would ask for a limiting instruction about what we just heard about the AMI conversations. I wouldn’t ask you to restate the full instruction, just that the same instruction applies to the testimony regarding Mr. Pecker getting a Notice from the PEG.

MS. HOFFINGER: I think we already addressed that.

THE COURT: I did give an instruction.

MR. BLANCHE: I am not asking for the full instruction, just a reminder.

MS. HOFFINGER: I think you gave a full instruction when Mr. Pecker testified, but it’s up to the Court.

THE COURT: What would you like me to say?

MR. BLANCHE: Remind them, if you could, that you previously instructed them upon why the AMI evidence came in and that instruction still applies.

THE COURT: Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.

THE COURT: So, Jurors, you may recall that I previously gave you an instruction regarding AMI. The testimony that you just heard now is consistent with my previous instructions that that evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing David Pecker’s credibility and to help provide context for some other surrounding events. You may consider that testimony and what you just heard for those purposes only. Mr. Blanche, is that satisfactory?

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Mr. Cohen, just getting back to where we left off in my questions. In terms of the substance of your conversation with David Pecker about his receipt of the Complaint from the FEC, did you tell him that someone in particular in the administration would be able to assist in that manner?

A Yes.

Q What did you tell him?

A I told him that the matter is going to be taken care of and the person, of course, who is going to be able to do it is Jeff Sessions.

Q Who was Jeff Sessions at the time?

A The Attorney General.

Q Why did you tell him that?

A Because that was post my conversation with the President.

Q And when you say, post, had you previously been told that by President Trump?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Now, I know you mentioned previously the work that you did on the Temporary Restraining Order related to Stormy Daniels. Do you remember that testimony?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Did there come a time when, as a result of some of the public statements you were making about your being the only one involved in the payment, and the fact that —— withdrawn. That is a long sentence —— a long question. Did there come a time around this time period that you made certain statements to news reporting, indicating that only you had made the payment and that, in fact, no sexual encounter had occurred?

A Yes.

Q And did you learn, as a result of that, that Ms. Daniels was going to go out publicly and speak about the matter to some news outlets like 60 Minutes and Fox News?

A Yes.

Q And, as a result of that, was that why, in part, you attempted, along with Larry Rosen, to get a Temporary Restraining Order for her?

A Yes.

Q And was that at Mr. Trump’s direction to work with Larry Rosen to get a Temporary Restraining Order?

A Yes. As well as with Eric Trump.

Q Now, did you, in fact —— did you, in fact, get an arbitration court Temporary Restraining Order?

A We did. We filed the arbitration proceeding in California through an in—house attorney with the Trump Organization named Jill Martin, because Larry —— neither Larry Rosen or I are California Bar admitted, so she filed the arbitration.

Q And did you provide that Temporary Restraining Order to Keith Davidson, Ms. Daniels’ attorney?

A I tried.

Q Explain that.

A After obtaining the arbitration proceeding decision, we were granted a Temporary Restraining Order. You are required to serve it upon the individual, and I didn’t, of course, have her address. So I tried to serve it upon Keith Davidson. And when I say, I, I am talking about the —— I'm talking about the group, Larry Rosen, Jill Martin, et cetera. And at some point ——

Q I am sorry.

A —— we weren't able to do that. And then Keith Davidson responded to me that he is no longer representing her. And he gave me the name of another lawyer that he said was representing her. After speaking to that lawyer, he also stated that he wasn’t representing her. And, again, still unable to get her address to serve it. Ultimately, it was provided to me that Michael Avenatti was going to be representing her going forward.

Q And at some point after that, did Mr. Avenatti file a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, yourself and Essential Consultants to try to get freed from the Non—Disclosure Agreement?

A Yes.

Q And, eventually, in September of 2018, did Mr. Trump and yourself agree not to enforce the NBA?

A Yes.

Q And do you recall when Mr. Trump agreed through his lawyers not to enforce the NDA? At what point in the proceedings did that occur?

A I don’t recall.

Q Was that a civil case?

A It is, yes.

Q Was he going to be required to sit for a deposition in that case?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Can you explain that a little bit to the jury?

A So, the action was filed, and what proceeded was, from the civil action, was Mr. Trump would be required —— President Trump would be required to sit for a deposition. And prior to that date where he would be required to sit, the decision was made that he would not sit and, therefore, the matter was agreed to and the Non—Disclosure Agreement was terminated.

MR. BLANCHE: Objection, your Honor. And I ask that that be stricken.

THE COURT: Please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion is held at sidebar, on the record.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I don't know what foundation was laid that he had or didn’t have to give that answer. I don’t believe there was any foundation for him knowing the answer that he just gave about why the decision was made. I mean, this happened, I believe, in September of 2018.

THE COURT: So your objection is there is not a foundation?

MR. BLANCHE: Along with several ——

MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, if President Trump took the Fifth Amendment, and they are trying to give an inference that he would do that, that he didn't testify because he might have incriminated himself, that might —— I am sorry —— this is so improper. That he would have taken the Fifth; he didn’t want to testify. This is so improper.

MS. HOFFINGER: I didn't elicit that.

MS. NECHELES: That was totally the inference. The inference is that ——

THE COURT: You have two different objections?

MS. NECHELES: I think both objections. That it all be stricken and that the jury be instructed that that should all be disregarded.

MS. HOFFINGER: I can certainly lay more of a foundation.

THE COURT: I think you are going far afield.

MS. HOFFINGER: Okay. I will stop at this point. Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Discussion at sidebar concluded, and the following occurred in open court.

THE COURT: The objection is sustained. The answer is stricken from the record, and the jury is directed not to consider that response.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q Through much of 2018, while you were acting as Mr. Trump —— then President Trump's personal attorney, did you continue to lie about his role in the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q I want to direct your attention now to April 9th of 2018. What happened to you on that day?

A I was raided by the FBI.

Q Can you tell the jury a little bit about that?

A So, at the time I was residing at the Lowes Regency because my apartment had been flooded by the apartment above. We had moved into the Regency while the construction was taking place in the apartment. At seven o’clock in the morning, there was a knock on the door. And I looked through the peephole, and I saw a ton of people out in the hallway. And so, I saw a badge. So, I opened the door. They identified themselves as the FBI, asked me to step into the hallway, which I did. I found out that simultaneously they had also, the FBI, raided my apartment that was under construction, my law office and TD Bank, which had a safety deposit box that I had just opened in order to put valuables in because I didn’t want to keep them in the hotel or, obviously, in the apartment. It was under repair.

Q And did the FBI search those locations for items of yours?

A They did.

Q And what kind of things did they seize from you when they executed that search warrant at your hotel room?

A The search warrant gave them the right to take my two cell phones, to take any and all electronic devices, as well as records. They took my two cell phones and a series of my tax books, as well as other documents. I, ultimately, found out that they also, basically, packed up much of the documentation that was in my law office and took that as well.

Q Now, you mentioned two cell phones that they took. Were those the two cell phones associated with the numbers ending 0114 containing the phone, the audio recording with Donald Trump that we heard previously, which is People’s Exhibit 246?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q So that was one of the phones that they seized, is that right?

A Yes.

Q And they seized another cell phone as well in addition, is that right?

A Correct.

Q Now, the cell phone that they took containing the audio recording of yourself and Mr. Trump, did you know that the FBI was going to show up and take your phones?

A No, ma'am.

Q Had you, prior to them showing up and taking those phones from you, altered that recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump on September 6th of 2016?

A No, ma'am.

Q How did you feel at the time about the FBI searching your hotel room, your home, your law offices? How were you feeling at the time?

A How do you describe your life being turned upside down? Concerned. Despondent. Angry.

Q Were you frightened?

A Yes, ma'am.

Q Did you come to understand, as a result of these search warrants that were executed, that you were under investigation by Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York?

A Yes.

Q Did you speak with President Trump shortly after these search warrants were executed?

A I did.

Q Can you explain the conversation? Can you describe the conversation you had with then President Trump?

A I received a phone call from President Trump in response to me leaving a message for him to call me. I wanted, obviously, him to know what was taking place. And he said to me: Don’t worry. I am the President of the United States. There is no —— there is nothing here. Everything is going to be okay. Stay tough. You are going to be okay.

Q Have you spoken directly with Mr. Trump since that time?

A No, ma’am.

Q Was your call from President Trump at that time important to you?

A Extremely important.

Q Why was it important?

A Because I wanted —— first of all, I was scared. This was the first time in my life anything like this happened, and I wanted some reassurance that Mr. Trump had my back. Especially as —— especially his help with issues that related to him.

Q How, if at all, did that call affect you in terms of how you acted going forward?

A Well, when he expressed to me, don’t worry, everything is going to be fine, I am the President of the United States, I felt reassured because I had the President of the United States protecting me, his Justice Department. This should go nowhere. And so, I felt reassured, and I remained in the camp.

Q What do you mean by, in the camp?

A In the fold. In the, um, in the Trump camp.

Q Does that mean that you stayed loyal to him?

A Yes.

Q And continued to lie about his involvement?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And did other people reach out to you around this time and express President Trump’s support for you?

A Yes.

Q In general, what did others tell you?

A You are loved. Don’t worry. He’s got your back. Most powerful guy in the country, if not the world. You are going to be okay.

Q Now, after the FBI executed those search warrants and you received that call from President Trump and messages from others, did you initially maintain ties with President Trump?

A Only through other people.

Q And did you believe that was important to do?

A Extremely.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we show People’s Exhibit 407—F, please, in evidence? Can we blow up the top tweet?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And I am going to ask Mr. Cohen to read them. First of all, were you aware of these three tweets made by President Trump at that time on April 21st of 2018.

A Yes.

Q And can you read those, please, to the jury?

A This is from Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed. The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crocked H flunkey, who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. They use nonexistent sources and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account slash lawyer who I have always liked and respected. Most people will flip if the Government let’s them out of trouble. Even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't know —— I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media.

Q Who did you understand, at the time, that Mr. Trump was communicating with or releasing these public statements?

A To me.

Q And what did you understand him to be communicating to you?

A Stay in the fold. Stay loyal. I have you. You are a fine person. Don’t flip.

Q And what did these public statements —— what, if anything, did these public statements have on you in terms of an effect on your conduct at the time?

A It reinforced my loyalty and my intention to stay in the fold.

Q Was President Trump or his company, The Trump Organization, still paying your lawyer’s legal fees at the time?

A They were.

Q And did you understand that that was part of his support for you?

A Yes.

Q And during this time were you still a part of the Joint Defense Agreement with President Trump and some others?

A I was.

MS. HOFFINGER: We can take that down. Thank you. I have one further question. Can you put that up?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Most people will flip if the Government let’s them get out of trouble.

MS. HOFFINGER: If you can put that up one more time.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Based on that line, most people will flip if the Government let’s them out of trouble, based on that public communication, what did you understand Mr. Trump wanted in terms of whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Did you have any understanding at the time from that public statement about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained as to the form. Please rephrase.

Q What, if any, understanding did you have about that public statement?

A That Mr. Trump did not want me to cooperate with Government and certainly not to provide information or flip.

Q And if you had cooperated with law enforcement at that time and told them the truth, what would you have told them about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the Stormy Daniels payoff?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, would you like to take a —— let me know if this is a good time for a break.

THE COURT: Yes. Let’s take your morning recess. Please remember all of my admonitions. See you in 15 minutes.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. HOFFINGER:

Q. Mr. Cohen, are you familiar with an attorney by the name of Robert Costello?

A. I am.

Q. How do you know him?

A. I was introduced to Robert Costello by another lawyer named Jeff Citron.

Q. And how did Mr. Citron first put you in touch with Mr. Costello?

A. Mr. Citron and I were both on the Advisory Board for Sterling National Bank. And after the raid, he obviously heard about it and saw it, he connected myself and Robert Costello together for the possibility of representing me in this matter.

Q. Did Mr. Citron tell you anything about Mr. Costello's background?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he tell you, in substance?

A. He told me he was a criminal defense attorney and that he was incredibly close to Rudy Giuliani.

Q. Now, did there come a time in April of 2018, after the search warrants, that you met with Mr. Costello?

A. Yes, ma’am.

Q. Where did you meet with him?

A. I met with him in the conference room at the Regency Hotel where I was staying.

Q. And, in general, what was your emotional state like at the time you met with him?

A. Distraught, nervous, concerned.

Q. And can you tell the jury about your conversation at the Regency Hotel with Mr. Costello?

A. So, it was Mr. Citron, myself and Robert Costello. They asked me to show them copies of the warrants, to describe what had happened. Which I did, at length. Basically, it was many hours, that many agents came, they took a series of books, documents, and I gave them the receipt of what was taken. With that, they turned around and they said, there are certain things you need to know. First is, that you have to, obviously, try to remember what might be in any of those boxes, what they might be looking for. He walked me through the process. First time in my life. I never practiced criminal law. And then they asked me to consider Robert Costello for my representation.

Q. Did Mr. Costello at that meeting tell you anything about his ties to Mr. Giuliani?

A. Yes.

Q. In substance, what did he tell you?

A. He said he had been at the Southern District of New York. That he is incredibly close to Rudy Giuliani. And what I mean by close, he means as close as you can imagine. And that would be a relationship that would be very beneficial to you going forward with this matter.

Q. Can you explain why that would be a beneficial relationship for you?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say?

A. Because Mr. Giuliani at the time had a very close relationship and was spending a tremendous amount of time with President Trump.

Q. And did he speak to you about a back channel of communications?

A. He also stated to me that this would be a great way to have a back channel communication to the President in order to ensure that you're still good and that you're still secure.

Q. During that meeting, did you tell Mr. Costello the truth about what Mr. Trump's role was in the payoff to Stormy Daniels?

A. No.

Q. Why not?

A. First, I wasn't sure that I was going to hire him. There was something really sketchy and wrong about him. He came with a Retainer Agreement, and I said, "I'm not going to pay that right now. I am still speaking to other lawyers." So I certainly wasn't going to expose anything to, one, someone I didn't know, and two, I was having trouble connecting with.

Q. Did you understand that if you provided that information to him about Mr. Trump's involvement in the Stormy Daniels matter, that that information might go somewhere else?

A. I was also concerned, again, when he started talking about his incredibly close relationship to Rudy, that anything I said to him was going to be spoken and told to Rudy Giuliani. And, of course, because Rudy Giuliani at the time was so proximate to Mr. Trump, President Trump, that anything that I said would get back to him.

Q. Did Mr. Costello mention anything to you about whether —— withdrawn. After the meeting with Mr. Costello, did you also have some phone calls with him?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also exchange some emails or text messages with him?

A. Yes.

Q. In some phone calls, did he ever mention to you that it would not be a good idea for you to speak with President Trump directly?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he suggest some other method of communication?

A. Again, back channel from Robert Costello to Rudy.

Q. Now, you mentioned that you exchanged emails with Mr. Costello?

A. Yes.

Q. And on the thumb drive that you previously reviewed, did you also have an opportunity to review emails with Mr. Costello marked as People's Exhibit 203 to 205 for identification?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. Did you exchange those emails from your email account to Mr. Costello's email account?

A. Yes.

Q. And other than some redactions, are those emails exact copies of email communications you exchanged with Mr. Costello on the dates and times reflected in those emails?

A. They are.

MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, I offer People's Exhibit 203 through —— I apologize, 208 in evidence.

MR. BLANCHE: No objection.

THE COURT: People's 203 through 208 are accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibits 203 through 208 were received and marked into evidence.

MS. HOFFINGER: Now, can we please put up People's Exhibit 203.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Can you tell the jury what this is, and walk us through it?

A. This is an email that I received from Robert Costello on Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 6:45 p.m. It is cc'd to Jeffrey Citron as a followup: "I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which can be very, very useful for you. Bob Costello."

Q. What did you understand this email to be about?

A. To validate the relationship with Rudy that he expressed to me. And, again, to re—enforce the whole concept of the back channel.

A. It is from Robert Costello. Again, to me. Dated Saturday, April 21, 2018, at 12:02 a.m. Subject is: Giuliani. He writes: Privileged and confidential. "Michael, I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team. Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you. He asked me if it was okay to call the President and Jay Sekulow. And I said, fine." "We discussed the facts, Jay Goldberg's stupid remarks, et cetera." He said: "I can't tell you how pleased I am that I could work with someone I know and trust. He asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on you and your family and he will make sure —— to make sure to tell the President." He said: "Thank you for opening this back channel of communication and asked me to keep in touch." "I told him I would after speaking to you further." "Bob."

Q. And, again, who is Jay Sekulow referenced in here as well?

A. Attorney for the President.

Q. Who did you understand, based on this email and your communications with Mr. Costello, that that back channel communication would be with?

A. The back channel was Bob Costello to Rudy to President Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Please put up People's Exhibit 205.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Mr. Cohen, if you would explain who those emails are to and from and read the email to the jury?

A. It's from Robert Costello. It was sent on Saturday, April 21, 2018, at 8:57 p.m. to me. Subject: Again, Giuliani. It is stating: Attorney—client communication, privileged. "I spoke with Rudy. Very, very positive. You are loved. If you want to call me, I will give you the details. I told him everything you asked me to and he said they knew that. There was never a doubt, and they are in our corner. Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained. He called it crucial and noted how reassured they were that they had someone like me who Rudy has known for so many years in this role. Sleep well tonight. You have friends in high places." "P.S.: Some very positive comments about you from the White House. Rudy noted how that followed my chat with him last night."

Q. What did you understand Mr. Costello to mean by "you are loved," by whom?

A. By President Trump.

Q. What did you understand him to be referring to when he said "they are in our corner?"

A. Meaning the President and Rudy.

Q. And what did you understand him to be referring to as "friends in high places?"

A. Friends in high places was President Trump.

Q. And the P.S., where he says, "Some very positive comments about you from the White House —— "

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People's 407F that we just saw a little while ago.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. What is the date, what is the date of these public Truth —— tweets that we saw President Trump issuing about you?

A. April 21, 2018.

Q. Is that the same date as the email that Mr. Costello sent you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you understand Mr. Costello in his email to be responding to these public tweets that President Trump made about you?

A. Yes.

Q. What, if any, effect did these emails from Mr. Costello, together with President Trump's support tweets for you on April 21st, what, if any, effect did they have on you?

A. It let me know that I was still important to the team and stay the course, that the President had my back.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we take a look now at People's Exhibit 206 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Is this email some months later, now in June of 2018?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you read this email for the jury, please, and the to and from and the dates?

A. It's from Robert Costello. Dated June 7, 2018, at 3:16 p.m. to me. Marked: Attorney—Client Privilege Communication. "Michael, to prove to you that Rudy Giuliani called me and I did not call him, I photographed the pages from my iPhone, which I am attaching. They show that you called me at 11:30 a.m. today on my cell and that the next call I had was two incoming calls from Rudy Giuliani at 1:08 p.m., and then at 1:15 p.m., because the first cell call transmission was lost. Calling from Israel." "And Guilani called me back at 1:15." "After you called me back at 2:43 p.m. and we spoke, I called and left a message for Rudy at 2:55 New York time. I will let you know when I hear back from him."

Q. What do you understand Mr. Costello communicating here and what was going on at the time?

A. He is demonstrating his close proximate relationship to Rudy Giuliani. Again, at this point in time I had not retained Costello or advised him that I was going to be retaining him. In order to stay in the fold, he was expressing to me his obvious relationship to Rudy Giuliani who was proximate to President Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: If you can take that down. Please put up People's 207 in evidence. Thank you. Can we blow that up, the first paragraph. Is there a way to blow up first the first paragraph? Can we see the date at the top of the email. Can we blow up the top of the e—mail for Mr. Cohen.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Can you explain who it is from and who it is to and the date?

A. Again, from Robert Costello. It's dated June 13 of 2018 at 3:21 p.m. Subject: Forward update draft. Again, it's sent to me.

Q. Can you read that first paragraph?

A. "Michael, since you jumped off the phone rather abruptly, I did not get a chance to tell you that my friend has communicated to me that he is meeting with his client this evening." And he added, "if there was anything you wanted to convey, you should tell me and my friend will bring it up for discussion this evening."

Q. Who did you understand his reference to be "my friend;" in other words, who was "my friend" that he is meeting with, his client this evening? Who did you understand that to be a reference to?

A. Rudy Giuliani.

Q. Who would Mr. Gulani's client be?

A. Donald J. Trump, President Trump.

Q. Did you have some understanding about why he didn't just say outright Rudy Giuliani and President Trump?

A. Sort of to be covert. It's all back channel sort of spy—ish. Didn't want to put anybody's name. Why on this one as opposed to this one? But, clearly, never mentioning President Trump, using code words.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the second paragraph in the email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Read that, Mr. Cohen?

A. "I would suggest that you give this invitation some real thought. Today's newspaper story should not rattle you. The event announced today we thought would be announced Friday or Monday, so it's merely a difference of timing." "MWE, McDermott Will & Emery, were brought in to a discrete task. They performed those services in an exemplary fashion. This is not a change in plan. Rather, it is exactly what was planned." "Your message, or the message of MWE, should be positive and not negative in any way. What you do next is for you to decide. But if that choice requires any discussion with my friend's client, you have the opportunity to convey that this evening, but only if you so decide."

Q. Again, what did you understand him to be saying, "If you want to convey something to my friend's client?"

A. Talking about potential pre—pardons, I believe.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we blow up the third paragraph.

Q. Who is my friend's client in that paragraph?

A. President Trump.

Q. Read the third paragraph.

A. "I must tell you, quite frankly, that I'm not used to listening to abuse like today's conversation. You have called me numerous times over the last month to discuss issues. I have already tried to be as helpful as I could." "You told me back in April that I was part of the team. I've acted accordingly on your behalf." "When I suggested that we meet and discuss a strategy following this news, you suddenly took a new approach and stated, "That's not going to happen." "Stunned by this remark, I was asking you for a clarification of our legal relationship. You indicated that you would be talking to someone in a boutique firm that was not ready to get involved. When I noted that you were willing to sit down with them but not sit down with us, you had an unfortunate outburst." "I relayed the situation to Jeff Citron, who suggested that you probably were just having a bad moment, but that it was necessary to seek clarification of our position with you in light of your remarks."

Q. What was happening at the time? What did you understand this to be about?

A. So, Mr. Costello, again, pressuring me, as he had done, with constant calls and sending me emails and so on. And he wanted to absolutely be retained to represent me in this matter. I stated to him that I was speaking with someone in a boutique firm and that we were still not yet ready for the engagement. He was angered that I was willing to sit down with that other attorney, but not sit down with them. And so I had had enough and I told him. Then it goes on to mention Jeff Citron. That is the lawyer who I had the relationship with on the Advisory Board of Sterling Bank for a couple of years. And, then, of course, expressed in the last line that it was necessary to seek clarification of the position in light of me telling them that's just not going to happen. My concern here was that all of these conversations were being relayed back to Mr. Giuliani and, of course, his client, President Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we pull up the last paragraph in the email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Can you read that, Mr. Cohen?

A. "Please remember if you want or need to communicate something, please let me know and I will see that it gets done. I hope I am wrong, but it seems to both Jeff and I, perhaps we have been played here. Let me know what you want to do."

Q. What did you understand him to be mean "that it seemed like he was being played here?"

A. I was not going to retain them. That they had, of course, expressed —— Jeff —— I should say, Bob Costello had expressed clearly to Mr. Giuliani that he was on the team and that he was going to be representing me. The concern here was that I was going to go to another lawyer and retain another lawyer to represent me in this matter.

Q. What did you understand him to mean by "If you need to communicate something, he would get it done," who did you understand he was talking about communicating with?

A. To Rudy Giuliani. Ultimately, to reach President Trump.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you. You can take that down. Please put up People's Exhibit 208. Blow up the top of the email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A. This is from Bob Costello to me on Thursday, June 14, 2018, at 9:45 a.m. Hyperlink to a YouTube video. And he writes: "Something you should see. Bob."

Q. And do you have a recollection of what that video that he was sending you, what it was about, or did he disclose it in a further part of this email?

A. I don’t.

MS. HOFFINGER: Let's take a look at the next email in the chain.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. What does the subject line of your response email to him say?

A. "Giuliani on Possibility of Cohen Cooperating: Mueller Probe."

Q. Does that refresh your recollection about what the YouTube video was about?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. What was it about, in general?

A. It was Rudy Giuliani in a TV appearance talking about my potential cooperation with the Mueller probe.

Q. And what did you respond to him?

A. Why send this to me?

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we look at the next email in the chain, where there is an answer from Mr. Costello. If you could blow up the first paragraph.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A. This is an email, again, from Robert Costello to me. The same date, June 14, 2018, at 1:12 p.m. "The answer to your question will be found in watching the video. It seems clear to me that you are under the impression that Trump and Giuliani are trying to discredit you and throw you under the bus, to use your phrase." "I think you are wrong, because you are believing the narrative promoted by the left wing media. They want you to believe what they are writing. Many of them are already writing that you are cooperating. This strategy has been consistent from the start, to put pressure on you into believing that you are alone. That everyone you knew before is distancing themselves from you and you are being 'thrown under the bus'." "The whole objective of this exercise by the SDNY is to drain you emotionally and financially until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation. I told you that the very first day I met you."

MS. HOFFINGER: Blow up the last paragraph as well in this email.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A. "You are making a very big mistake if you believe the stories these journalists are writing about you. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed." "If you really believe you are not being supported properly by your former boss, then you should make your position known." "If you really want certain things to happen, you should make that known." "If you really want other lawyers to refrain from saying this or that, you should make it known." "You have the ability to make that communication when you want to. Whether you exercise that ability is totally up to you."

Q. What did you understand Mr. Costello to be communicating to you here?

A. And this is part of the pressure campaign, that everyone is lying to you. That you are still regarded. The President still supports you. Do not speak. Do not listen to what any of the journalists or anybody are saying and stay in the fold. Don't flip. Don’t speak. Don't cooperate.

Q. Did you understand that he was —— what did you understand he was telling you about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

A. Not to.

Q. What did you understand him to be saying to you in terms of, if you really want things to happen, if you want to make things known, you should let me know; what did you understand that to be about?

A. Again, him being a back channel.

Q. Back channel to who?

A. Back channel to the President via Rudy Giuliani.

Q. Mr. Cohen, did you ever tell the truth, Mr. Cohen, about President Trump —— withdrawn. Mr. Cohen, did you ever tell the truth to Mr. Costello about Donald Trump’s involvement in AMI’s purchase of Karen McDougal’s story to prevent that coming out before the election or Donald Trump’s involvement and direction to your paying Stormy Daniels to prevent her story from coming out before the election?

A. No.

Q. Why did you not tell Mr. Costello the truth about Mr. Trump's involvement in those matters?

A. I didn't trust him. Meaning, Bob Costello. And I was still remaining loyal to Mr. Trump.

Q. Did you believe that if you told him the truth, that he would tell that to someone?

A. Yes.

Q. Who did you believe he would tell it to?

A. I believed, based upon all of our conversations, that he would immediately run back to Mr. Giuliani and that communication would be divulged to President Trump.

Q. Did you ever retain Mr. Costello to represent you?

A. No.

Q. Did you instead retain other lawyers to represent you in connection with the criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York?

A. I did.

Q. Now, in the months after those FBI raids on your home, your office, your hotel room, in addition to seeking advice from lawyers about what to do, did you have some conversations with your family about the matter?

A. Yes.

Q. And tell the jury a bit about those conversations with your family?

A. Well, at that point in time we didn’t even know what the Southern District of New York was even looking at. And the conversations with my family was what to do. We’re in this unique situation I never experienced. And my family, my wife, my daughter, my son, all said to me, why are you holding onto this loyalty? What are you doing? We're supposed to be your first loyalty?

Q. So what decision did you make?

A. That it was about time to listen to them.

Q. What did you decide about where your loyalty should be going forward?

A. To my wife, my daughter, my son, and the country.

Q. Let me direct your attention now to August 21, 2018. Did you plead guilty on that day in a court in the Southern District of New York to a number of federal crimes?

A. I did.

Q. By that time, in late August of 2018, what, if anything, had you decided about whether you would continue to lie for President Trump?

A. I made a decision based on the conversation that I had with my family, I would not lie for President Trump any longer.

Q. And on August 21, 2018, did you plead guilty to one count of making an excessive campaign contribution in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act?

A. I did.

Q. What did that charge relate to?

A. Stormy Daniels.

Q. And did it relate to, specifically, your paying $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to buy the life rights to her story so that it would not be public and that it was done on behalf of President Trump to influence the election?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you admit that you paid that money to Stormy Daniels in order to influence Mr. Trump's electoral prospects?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

Q. Now, did you also plead guilty to five counts of ——

MR. BLANCHE: We would ask for the instruction, please.

THE COURT: All right. Jurors, I'm going to give you an instruction at this time. You have just heard testimony that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating the Federal Elections Campaign Act, otherwise known as FECA. That evidence was permitted to assist you, the jury, in assessing Mr. Cohen's credibility as a witness and to help provide context for some of the events that followed. You may consider that testimony for those purposes only. Mr. Cohen's plea is not evidence of the defendant's guilt, and you may not consider it in determining whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charged crimes.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

Q. Mr. Cohen, did you also plead guilty to five counts of Evasion of Personal Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2016?

A. I did.

Q. Did you also plead guilty to one count of Making False Statements to a Financial Institution?

A. I did.

Q. Were those counts: Tax Evasion and False Statements to a Financial Institution, were those in any way related to Mr. Trump?

A. No.

Q. Mr. Cohen, what was that day like for you, pleading guilty to all those crimes?

A. Worst day of my life.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we please put up People's Exhibit 407H and 407I. If we can do them together.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Mr. Trump —— I am sorry, Mr. Cohen, are you able to read those?

A. Yes, ma’am.

Q. What date —— you plead guilty on August 21, 2018?

A. That is correct.

Q. What are the dates of these tweets by President Trump?

A. August 22 of 2018.

Q. Were these the day after you pled guilty in Federal Court?

A. Yes, ma’am.

Q. Can you please read one and then the other. First of all, were you aware of President Trump tweeting these on that day?

A. Yes. On his post he writes: "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen." Then put out another one: "I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12—year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him, and unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break, make up stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a brave man."

Q. Who did you understand these tweets by Trump to be addressed to?

A. To me.

Q. What, if any, message did you understand he was communicating to you?

A. Certainly displeasure that I no longer, I guess, was important to the fold.

Q. What, if anything, did you understand was being communicated to you about whether you should cooperate with law enforcement?

A. No, do not cooperate.

Q. What, if any, effect did it have on you at the time to have the President of the United States tweeting this about you the day after you pled guilty?

A. It caused a lot of angst, anxiety.

MS. HOFFINGER: Now, you can take those down.

Q. Now, in spite of President Trump's public tweets about you, about three months later, on November 29, 2018, did you also plead guilty to one count of Making False Statements to Congress in 2017?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And was that for making false statements to Congress in 2017, in connection with the Russia probe that you described previously to the jury?

A. Yes. A number of times and the duration, which I had stated and submitted as part of the record that I had spoken to Mr. Trump about the Trump Tower Moscow Project.

Q. And were those false statements that you made to Congress in 2017 while were you Mr. Trump's personal counsel?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. President Trump's personal counsel?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. Now, let me direct your attention to December 12, 2018. As a result of pleading guilty to the federal crimes that you've just described, your pleading guilty in August of 2018 and also November of 2018, were you sentenced by a Court in the Southern District of New York?

A. I was.

Q. And what was the sentence that you received from the court as a result of pleading guilty to those crimes?

A. 36 months incarceration followed by 36 months of supervised release.

Q. And were you also required to pay fines and some restitution?

A. Yes.

Q. Explain that to the jury, please?

A. So the restitution stemmed from the amount of tax that was not paid over the years from 2012 through 2016. And that tax bill amount was $1,394,000.

Q. And did you pay those taxes back to the IRS?

A. I did, before even sentencing, when I finally found out from the Southern District of New York what the actual amount was.

Q. After, were you also assessed some fines by the Court?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And did you, after being sentenced, did you also pay those fines?

A. I did. There were two fines. Each one for $50,000. One that dealt with Stormy Daniels and the other one that was for the campaign finance violation, I believe.

Q. Were you certain —— was one of them for the false statements to Congress?

A. Yes, that's the false statement to Congress.

Q. Now, approximately, when did you surrender to prison as a result of your sentence?

A. May 6th.

Q. Of what year?

A. Of 2019.

Q. Now, about three months after you surrendered to prison, in February of 2019, did you testify publicly before Congress?

A. I did.

Q. And how did that come about?

A. That came about by Representative Elijah Cummings, who was the Chair of the House Oversight Committee, reaching out to Lanny Davis, who is an attorney and was assisting me in legal strategy, as the case that I am talking about, the criminal case, was going on. They reached out to him and asked for me to appear.

Q. Did you provide information to both the House and Senate Intelligence Committee and also the House Oversight Committee?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you agree and actually testify publicly before surrendering to prison?

A. I did.

Q. Was your testimony before Congress televised?

A. One of them was, yes.

Q. And widely reported in the news as well?

A. It was.

Q. And did you testify about a number of issues and matters relating to President Trump and some others?

A. I did.

Q. Did you, among other things, testify about President Trump having directed you to pay off Stormy Daniels as prior to the election?

A. I did.

Q. Did you also testify about President Trump reimbursing you for those payoffs?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. What, if anything, else did you testify about concerning reimbursement?

A. That Mr. Trump had directed me, and it was for his benefit.

Q. Did you testify at all about the reimbursement of the monies to Stormy Daniels?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. What, if anything, else, did you testify about concerning the matter?

A. I testified about the reimbursement of the $130,000 with the payments made to me on the monthly basis.

Q. Did you apologize to Congress during that testimony?

A. I apologized to Congress. I apologized to the country. I apologize to my family.

Q. Did you apologize to Congress for also lying to them in 2017?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. What, if anything, did you apologize to Congress about, specifically?

A. For lying to them in the 2017 hearing that I was subpoenaed to attend.

Q. Did you also apologize to the American public?

A. I did.

Q. What did you apologize to the American public for?

A. For lying to them, for acting in a way that suppressed information that the citizenry had a right to know in order to make the determination of the individual who was seeking the highest office in the land.

Q. What was that experience like for you, to testify so publicly before Congress?

A. Horrible.

Q. Now, before you surrendered to prison in May of 2019 to serve out your sentence, did you also meet with and provide information to Prosecutors, for example, from the Special Counsel's office?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that the office that was investigating the Mueller investigation?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you meet with them on a number of times?

A. Yes.

Q. And provide information to them?

A. I did.

Q. To be clear, on your very first meeting with them in August of 2018, did you tell them the truth about your testimony before Congress in 2017?

A. I did not.

Q. Why not?

A. Because I was still holding onto the loyalty to President Trump.

Q. And after pleading guilty in August of 2018, August 21 of 2018, did you meet with the Special Counsel's Office on a number of other occasions?

A. I did.

Q. At that point, did you admit that your prior statements to Congress were false?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you provide them with other truthful testimony?

A. I did.

Q. A few months after testifying publicly to Congress in May of 2019, did you start your sentence, prison sentence?

A. I did.

Q. Where did you serve?

A. The Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville.

Q. How long did you spend in prison?

A. Thirteen months.

Q. You said your sentence was originally 36 months?

A. That's correct.

Q. Why did you serve only 13 months?

A. As a result of COVID, under the CARES Act, based upon my comorbidities, I was permitted to leave and serve the remainder of the sentence in home confinement.

Q. And were others similarly released during COVID from prison to serve out the rest of their time in home confinement?

A. Yes, ma'am.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter wa

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Continued from the previous page.

Q At some point while you were on home confinement or before —— withdrawn. At some point when you were released from prison and you were back in New York City, did you —— did you become —— at some point, were you sent back to prison?

A I was.

Q Can you describe, just very briefly for the jury, what happened?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A I was on furlough, which is the way that the institution had returned me home, and awaiting a date to meet with a company called GEO, which does residential reentry. They do the monitoring under what's called the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement. It’s an ankle bracelet. And I was finally given a date and was supposed to, the following day, head up to the Bronx to sign the paperwork and to do, um, the installation of the ankle bracelet. Instead, I received a phone call from an individual by the name of Adam Pakula over at 500 Pearl Street, which is the area of the Southern District of New York. They have their Bureau of Prisons, as well, Department of Correction. And I'm told that I need to go there instead of up to the Bronx. And it just didn’t make any sense. So I asked a friend of mine who happens to be a lawyer, Jeffrey K. Levine, to come with me because something just seems wrong. We get there, and we’re brought into an office with Adam Pakula, with his supervisor Ms. Enid Febus, and they give us a two—page document that’s supposed to represent the Federal Location Monitoring Agreement. It doesn't look like a Federal document to me or to my friend, Jeff. There’s no identifiable numbers on it, some typos and spelling mistakes. And we’re reading the first paragraph, and the first paragraph is a very broad paragraph of First Amendment violations: I'm not allowed to speak to the press ——

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Just, Mr. Cohen, I’ll ——

MS. HOFFINGER: I’ll just ask a few leading questions if I might, your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes.

Q Mr. Cohen, did the Agreement prevent you from speaking publicly and writing publicly?

A Yes.

Q Did you agree to sign that Agreement at that time?

A I asked them if we could tamp down the language, as I had been working on a book ——

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Mr. Cohen, I’m going to ask you a few direct questions.

A Sure.

Q Just to shorten it up for the jury.

A Sure.

Q When you were presented that Agreement, did you question it?

A I did.

Q As a result of questioning it, were you sent back to prison?

A Yes.

Q When you went to prison, where were you sent to?

A Back to solitary confinement.

Q And at some point, did you have a lawyer who petitioned a Court in the Southern District of New York to have you released from solitary confinement and from prison, back to home confinement?

A Yes.

Q And did the Judge in the Southern District rule ——

MS. HOFFINGER: I see that Mr. Blanche is standing.

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q As a result, were you sent back; was a decision made that you were sent back to your apartment to continue the rest of your sentence in home confinement?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Now, at various times, you mentioned that you provided information to the Special Counsel’s Office?

A (Nods yes).

Q Did you also provide information to other law enforcement officers at their request?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q For example, did you provide information to the New York Attorney General's Office?

A Yes.

Q Did you also provide information to our Office, the New York County District Attorney’s Office?

A Yes.

Q At our request, on a number of occasions?

A Yes.

Q In fact, the first time that you met with the District Attorney’s Office of New York, was that when you were still incarcerated in prison?

A Yes.

Q And you did that at our request?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And did you continue on a number of occasions to meet with our Office to provide information and to answer questions?

A Yes. On a total of three occasions.

Q On many occasions after that, did you also continue to provide information to our Office, on many occasions?

A Yes.

Q Now, in March of 2023, in connection with this case, did you testify in the grand jury?

A I did.

Q And when you testified in the grand jury pursuant to that subpoena, did you automatically receive immunity?

A I did.

Q And is it your understanding that that automatic immunity is provided to every witness who testifies in a grand jury in New York?

A That’s what my lawyer, Donny Perry, told me.

Q Now, since 2018, when you pled guilty to Federal crimes and you were sentenced for those Federal crimes, have you applied to the Court in the Southern District to receive a reduction in the sentence that you received there in that Federal Court?

A Yes.

Q Have you and your attorneys, at times, asked our Office to provide you with a letter detailing your cooperation with our Office, your providing information to us on a number of occasions at our request?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And was that to assist you for your request in seeking a reduction in your sentence for those Federal crimes?

A Yes.

Q In the year 20 —— withdrawn. In 2021, was it your understanding that our Office said we might provide you with such a letter detailing your cooperation with our Office if the Southern District of New York Prosecutors would consider it in reducing your sentence?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And was it your understanding that the Southern District Prosecutors declined to accept such a letter as a basis to reduce your sentence?

A Yes.

Q And so, as a result, did our Office ever provide you with such a letter?

A No, ma’am.

Q Despite that, have you still continued to provide our Office with information and continued to meet with us at our requests?

A I have.

Q Did your seeking a letter from our Office detailing your cooperation impact you telling the truth in meetings with our Office?

A No, ma’am.

Q Did it impact your telling the truth in your testimony before the grand jury?

A No, ma’am.

Q Did it impact your telling the truth here in court?

A No, ma’am.

Q I want to ask you some more questions about the cell phones. Remember the cell phones that the FBI seized in 2018 in connection with the search warrants?

A Yes.

Q At some point after you had returned home from prison, did those two cell phones get returned to you?

A Yes.

Q Approximately, when? Do you know?

A (No response).

Q In 2020 sometime?

A Yes.

Q And when they were returned to you, did you power them on?

A I might have.

Q For what reason might you have powered them on?

A Just to see if they were still working.

Q And in the interim between when they seized those phones and you went to prison and you came back, did you get another cell phone or other cell phones?

A I did.

Q And were you using other cell phones at the time?

A Cell phone.

Q Cell phone. One cell phone?

A (Nods yes).

Q And what did you do with those older phones that were returned to you by the FBI?

A One of them remained in one of the many boxes that were returned. And the other one was in a pouch that went into a drawer with a bunch of cell phones that were taken.

Q And that bunch of cell phones, were those —— did those belong to other family members?

A Yes. They belonged to my wife, my children. Over the years, accumulating cell phones.

Q Now, you said that the two cell phones were returned to you; one remained in a drawer, one was in a pouch. Did you use one of those phones for a particular purpose?

A I did.

Q What did you use that for?

A Myself and my friend/attorney, Jeffrey Levine, were engaging in a conversation with the Bureau of Prison regarding a FOIA request that was made; ignored. So, we were on the telephone with the individual from the BOP. And I wanted to record the conversation, because we were in litigation with them as well. So, I powered one of the cell phones up, and had my cell phone on speaker, and I recorded it.

Q So, did you use the older cell phone that you got back from the FBI to record a conversation on the new cell phone?

A Yes.

Q And at that time, were you under any legal restrictions about how to use these old cell phones that you got back from the FBI?

A No.

Q And did you know in the year 2020, when those phones were returned to you, that three years later we might ask if you would surrender those cell phones to us?

A No, I did not.

Q And when we asked you to provide those cell phones to us in January of 2023, did you do so voluntarily?

A I did.

Q Now, did you provide the two cell phones on two different dates in January of 2023?

A Yes.

Q Can you tell us why?

A Well, the cell phone that was in the pouch, I knew where it was. The one that was in the box was down in the storage area, and I needed to go find it.

Q So, did it take you a couple of days to go find it?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And did you provide those two cell phones to us powered off?

A I did.

Q And did you provide passwords to us for those phones?

A I did.

Q Based on our request?

A Based off of your request.

Q And you did so voluntarily?

A I did.

Q At any time with respect to —— withdrawn. At any time, did you alter or modify the audio recording of your conversation with Mr. Trump that was contained in People’s 246?

A No, ma’am.

Q Mr. Cohen, since you pled guilty in 2018 to those Federal crimes, have you made some public statements, in substance, that you believe you should not have been criminally prosecuted for the tax evasion and making false statements to a financial institution?

A I did.

Q And are you disputing the facts of those underlying charges, the tax evasion and the false statements to a bank?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q Are you ——

A No, I’m not. I have constantly maintained that I do not dispute the fact there was an error in the taxable amount and the tax that was due. What I did dispute, and I continue to dispute, is that for a first—time offender, who has consistently paid taxes on its due date and never having been, um, audited, that this would go immediately to a criminal charge. From the day that we found out, I was given 48 hours within which to plead guilty or the Southern District of New York was going to file an 80—page indictment that included my wife.

Q Is that because your wife had also signed those documents?

A That's correct.

Q With respect to the charge of false statements to a bank, are you disputing the underlying facts of that charge?

A No.

Q What is it that you're disputing with respect to that charge?

A That the —— that there was materiality in the, um, statement that they say was inaccurate or missing. I had the HELOC, again, which I think I explained.

Q Go on.

A The home equity line of credit. I had 80 percent equity in my home. And the same bank had the mortgage. It’s supposed to be a line of credit based off of your home's equity. There was ten times coverage. So, I didn’t believe that it should have been brought as a charge, either, based upon materiality. I’d had a HELOC on that same property for ten years, just with a different institution.

Q Are you disputing that there was an omission, however, in the HELOC application submitted to the bank?

A No, ma’am.

Q So, there was an omission?

A There was.

Q And you just don’t believe you should have been criminally prosecuted?

A Correct.

Q For that offense?

A Correct.

Q Nevertheless, did you take responsibility for those two crimes?

A I did.

Q And you paid the taxes that were owed?

A Paid the taxes, paid the fines, paid everything.

Q And you served time in prison?

A And served time in prison. In fact, I remain, even today, still on supervised release.

Q Now, Mr. Cohen, in October of 2023, did you testify at trial pursuant to a subpoena? Were you called to testify for the New York Attorney General's Office in a case, a civil case against Mr. Trump, The Trump Organization, and some other executives at the Trump Organization?

A I was.

Q And did you testify over the course of two days?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And in connection with your testimony, were you also cross—examined by Mr. Trump’s lawyers in that case?

A I was.

Q And, in particular, were you asked —— withdrawn. In particular, were you cross—examined about statements that you said you’d made publicly —— I see Mr. Blanche is rising.

MR. BLANCHE: Sorry.

MS. HOFFINGER: It’s all right. Would you like to approach?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Come up.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held at sidebarz

MR. BLANCHE: Judge, in opening statements, when I started talking about this incident, you sustained an objection because the People represented that —— because the People represented to your Honor that it was argument. And now they’re trying to elicit it from this witness on direct. I am definitely getting into it on cross. This seems appropriate for them on redirect, not on direct. I wasn't able to open on this. The objection was sustained on this.

MS. HOFFINGER: I just intend to elicit why he told the Court under cross—examination that he had lied to Judge Pauley in terms of his criminal plea. That's all. I’m not getting into anything further, but I'm going to have him explain why he told —— he testified in that case that he had lied to Judge Pauley. It’s consistent with what he testified to.

MR. BLANCHE: I'm not trying to cry over spilled milk. That was exactly what was sustained on opening, that he had lied under oath to Judge Pauley.

MS. HOFFINGER: You said "committed perjury".

THE COURT: You called him a "perjurer" when he said that. I think you did.

MR. BLANCHE: He admitted he committed perjury.

MS. HOFFINGER: He did not. He said he lied to Judge Pauley.

THE COURT: It was a fine line. It was the use of the word "perjury" or "perjurer" that I sustained.

MR. BLANCHE: Fine . I withdraw my objection. I needed to get that off my chest.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

THE COURT: The objection is withdrawn.

Q Mr. Cohen, in particular, were you cross—examined about statements that you’ve made about feeling that it was unfair for you to have been criminally prosecuted for tax evasion and a false statement to the bank?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And did Mr. Trump's lawyers ask you —— withdrawn. Did Mr. Trump’s lawyers ask you if as a result of those public statements you had made, that you had, therefore, lied in August of 2018 before the Judge who took your plea, meaning that you had lied in taking a criminal plea to tax evasion and bank fraud?

A Yes, they did ask that.

Q Did you admit under questioning that, yes, you told Judge Pauley that it was a lie when you agreed to plead guilty to those counts?

A Yes.

Q Can you explain, very briefly, what you meant when you said, yes, you lied to Judge Pauley when you took that criminal plea to those counts in 2018?

A What I was saying: I was going to take responsibility because the underlying fact I have never disputed. But, it goes back, again, to the issue that I was given 48 hours to accept their plea offer or they were going to file an 80—page indictment that included my wife. And I was going to protect my wife.

Q And, now, just to make sure that I’m clear, you’ve never said that you lied to Judge Pauley about your plea to the two campaign finance violations; is that right?

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

A That's correct.

THE COURT: Sustained as to form. The answer is stricken.

Q Did you ever lie in connection with your guilty plea or any other time about whether you were guilty of those campaign finance violations?

A No, ma’am.

Q Mr. Cohen, are you still a practicing attorney?

A No, ma’am.

Q Why not?

A I lost my law license as a direct result of this.

Q As a result of your felony pleas?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q How many years, in total, did you practice law before you were disbarred?

A Thirty.

Q Over the years while you were practicing law, you said you had some businesses; is that right?

A That's correct.

Q Do you still have the taxi medallion business that you testified about?

A No, ma’am.

Q And do you still —— just briefly, did you sell off those businesses, the taxi medallion business?

A Two separate times. 2002, I sold a management company which I had 15 percent interest to my ex partner, but I retained the medallions as an asset. As a result of the felony conviction, felons are not allowed to own New York City taxi medallions, so I had to sell those. The same holds true to the taxi medallions I owned in Chicago.

Q You mentioned you previously owned some real estate. Have you sold much of that?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Do you still retain some real estate?

A No. Only one secondary apartment.

Q As well as your own apartment?

A As well as my primary residence. All the rest I had to sell.

Q After pleading guilty to those felonies and being disbarred from practicing law, what type of work have you been able to be engaged in now?

A Predominantly, it’s media and entertainment.

Q Tell us a little bit about that. What kind of media and entertainment do you engage in?

A While I was on home confinement, I started my first podcast called Mea Culpa.

Q What does that term, "Mea Culpa", mean?

A Well, I named it Mea Culpa for two reasons. The first is, it means it's my responsibility, which I take. The second is because it’s my initials.

Q Your podcast, Mea Culpa, what do you discuss on those podcasts?

A News of the day.

Q Do you also spend a good deal of time on those podcasts discussing Mr. Trump?

A I do.

Q And your experiences with him?

A I do.

Q And do you make money as a result of that podcast?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Do you also have another podcast?

A I do.

Q And do you make money from that, as well?

A Yes.

Q Do you also on that podcast discuss —— frequently on that podcast discuss President Trump?

A That is also a news podcast. I do that with MeidasTouch and Ben Meiselas. The format is different topics. It’s for YouTube.

Q Among other topics, did you discuss Mr. Trump?

A I do.

Q Have you written two books?

A I have.

Q What was the first book you wrote?

A Disloyal, which was a memoir.

Q When did you write that?

A While in prison.

Q Why did you write that book?

A In order to pass the time. When you're in prison, time management is very important. It helps to make the time go quicker.

Q What is that book about?

A The book is about many different things. It’s about life, growing up, my wife, and experiences while working for Mr. Trump at the Trump Organization.

Q So, was a large part of that book about your experiences with Mr. Trump?

A Yes.

Q And what about the book Revenge —— and you made some money from that book, by the way, Disloyal?

A Yes.

Q What about the book Revenge; what is that about?

A Revenge is —— as I characterized it, it’s about the prosecution against me by the Southern District of New York. I refer to it as a forensic dissection of a corrupt prosecution against —— or a weaponization of the Justice Department by —— against a critic of the President's.

Q And are there portions of that book that are also related to Mr. Trump?

A There were portions, yes.

Q And have you made some money from that book, as well?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q And are these endeavors that you’ve engaged in conducted, largely, to support your family?

A Yes.

Q By the way, do you also —— in terms of your podcasts, do you make money by having advertisers; is that how you make money?

A Yes.

Q Have you also sold some merchandise?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Does that merchandise often have something to do with Mr. Trump?

A Um, there is one that is reflective of Mr. Trump. The others are just the name or a picture of myself.

Q In February of 2021, did you invite Stormy Daniels onto your podcast, Mea Culpa?

A I did.

Q And why did you do that?

A I thought it was time to speak to her. I had never spoken to her before. I never communicated with her before. And I thought it would be a good time to speak to her and mea culp, to apologize.

Q Apologize to her?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Did you do that?

A I did.

Q Was that the first time you’ve ever spoken to Stormy Daniels?

A I believe so.

Q In person?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Did you invite her once more on another podcast?

A I did.

Q Have you continued to be on the receiving end of Mr. Trump, of President Trump and his public comments about you?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Around the time that you testified in the grand jury in this case, were you aware of Mr. Trump posting negative comments about you on Truth Social?

A I was. Yeah, I was.

MS. HOFFINGER: Can we put up People’s Exhibit 408A, please, in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Can you —— do you notice the reference here to "convicted liar and felon, jailbird Michael Cohen, may have schemed up"?

A Yes, ma’am.

Q Do you understand that to be a reference to you at the time, in March of 2023?

A Yes.

Q Was that around the time that you were testifying in the grand jury in this matter?

A Yes.

Q Is that just a representative sample of some of the public statements that Mr. Trump has made about you on Truth Social and elsewhere?

A Yes.

Q Have there been many others that have been directed to you?

A Yes.

Q In April of 2023 ——

MS. HOFFINGER: You can take that down. Thank you very much.

Q On April 12th of 2023, eight days after Mr. Trump was charged here, did he file a lawsuit against you in Florida?

A He did.

Q How much did he sue you for?

A Half a billion dollars.

Q Did his complaint against you also include claims based on your testifying in the grand jury here?

A Yes.

Q And what, if any, effect did that lawsuit have on you?

A Financial, as well as emotional.

Q Ultimately, what happened with that case?

A Ultimately ——

Q Actually, I’m going to direct your attention to one question. Ultimately, did Mr. Trump —— did he —— withdrawn. Ultimately, did Mr. Trump dismiss that case against you?

A He did.

Q Without telling us why.

A (Nods yes.)

Q Mr. Cohen, do you have any regrets about your past work and your association with Donald Trump?

A I do.

Q What are they?

A I regret doing things for him that I should not have: lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal. I don’t regret working at the Trump Organization, ’cause, as I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But, to a —— to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass. And I suffered the penalty. As has my family.

MS. HOFFINGER: Nothing further, your Honor.

THE COURT: Jurors, let's go ahead and take our lunch recess at this time. I remind you of all of the admonitions, including: Do not discuss this case either among yourselves or anyone else. Continue to keep an open mind as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Do not express or form an opinion as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. I’ll see you at 2:15.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.

THE COURT: You can step down, Mr. Cohen.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness is excused.

A F T E R N O O N S E S S I O N

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The following proceedings are continued from the preceding page.

THE COURT: Good afternoon. Can we get the witness.

THE COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The witness Michael D. Cohen enters the courtroom and resumed the witness stand.

THE COURT: All right. Mr. Cohen, good afternoon. You are reminded that you are still under oath.

THE WITNESS: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right. Let’s get the jury, please.

THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. Jury entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury enters.

THE COURT: You may be seated.

THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, you may inquire.

MR. BLANCHE: May I inquire?

THE COURT: Yes.

CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q Mr. Cohen, my name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never spoken or met before; have we?

A We have not.

Q But you know who I am; don't you?

A I do.

Q As a matter of fact, on April 23rd, so after the trial started in this case, you went on TikTok and called me a "Crying Little Shit;" didn't you?

A Sounds like something I would say.

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. Sustained.

Q Do you remember on April 20th, which is again after this trial started, you commented about myself and Ms. Necheles about this case; correct?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. Please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: At Sidebar.

THE COURT: Why are you making this about yourself?

MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor ——

THE COURT REPORTER: One at a time, please. I did not hear you, your Honor.

THE COURT: I said, why are you making this about yourself?

MR. BLANCHE: I'm not making it about myself, your Honor. I have a right to show this witness's bias, and he has expressed bias about the lawyers just because of who we represent.

THE COURT: Well ——

MR. BLANCHE: I mean, Judge, it's crystal clear under Rule 613 that we are allowed to prove ——

THE COURT: I can't hear you.

MR. BLANCHE: It's clear under Rule 615 that we are allowed to prove bias in whatever form. It doesn't just matter if it's bias directed at the defendant. It can be bias about the lawyers on the case as well, of course.

MS. HOFFINGER: That's not true. It's not admissible if it's not about the defendant.

THE COURT: It doesn't matter if he has bias towards you; it doesn't matter. The issue is whether he has bias towards the defendant. Don't make it about myself.

MR. BLANCHE: I'm not trying to make it about myself, your Honor. I am just trying to show his bias toward the defendant.

THE COURT: Just don’t make it about yourself. I am going to sustain the objection and instruct the jury. Please, don’t make it about yourself.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Sidebar concluded.

MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I would ask ——

THE COURT: The objection is sustained.

MS. HOFFINGER: Judge, I would ask that the question be stricken.

THE COURT: The question is stricken from the record.

CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q Mr. Cohen, you have been following what’s happening in this trial; correct?

A To some extent, yes.

Q Well, you know, for example, details around the jury selection process; correct?

A I have made comments about the jury selection.

Q Sir, I’m not asking you if you made comments, I’m asking if you know, if you learned about certain things that happened during the jury selection process?

MS. HOFFINGER: I’m going to object, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Now, on April 23rd of this year, so after the trial started, you said that you had actually heard what a witness had testified about; correct?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.

A It's possible, yes.

Q Well, do you recall testifying —— do you recall saying on TikTok, on April 23rd, and that's when Mr. Pecker was still on the stand, that from everything that you heard from people today, David Pecker is corroborating what you have been saying for six years. Do you recall saying that?

A I do, yes.

Q And that's because you heard from people about what Mr. Pecker had testified to in this trial; correct?

A Yes, somebody had called me and told me that Mr. Pecker had corroborated what I have been saying for a long time.

Q And it's true that you also have been following what's happening in this courtroom on CNN and MSNBC; correct?

A I have seen CNN and MSNBC, but I am not following the trial.

Q Well, Mr. Cohen, you have been watching CNN and MSNBC during this trial; correct?

A I have been on CNN and —— I have watched CNN and MSNBC, but not religiously, in order to follow the full extent of the trial.

Q And you have said that you are watching on CNN and MSNBC —— maybe not all the time —— about some of the things that are happening during this trial; correct?

A I have turned it on, yes.

Q And that's because this trial is important to you; correct?

A I do it because at times there are other issues as well that I'm interested in seeing what's happening, like the protests or Israel and this issue comes up as well.

Q Well, is this trial important to you, Mr. Cohen?

A Personally, yes.

Q You also talked on social media during this trial about President Trump; have you not?

A Sounds correct, yes.

Q So, for example, on April 23rd, which is after the trial started; correct?

A Yes.

Q You referred to President Trump as a "Dictator Douche Bag;" didn't you?

A Sounds like something I said.

Q And on that same TikTok, so again on April 23rd, you referred to President Trump when he left the courtroom, you said that "he goes right into that little cage, which is where he belongs, in a fucking cage, like an animal." Do you recall saying that?

A I recall saying that.

Q And that was April 23rd, so during this trial, while the trial was already going on; correct?

A Sounds correct, yes.

Q Now, over the past several years, let's go back to —— in January 2021, okay, is it fair to say that the Government, meaning the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, have repeatedly asked you to stop talking publicly about this case?

A They might have, yes.

Q Well, I'm not asking you whether "they might have," I asked you: Is it fair to say that the Prosecutors, maybe not the Prosecutors at this table or next to me, but the Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, have repeatedly asked you to stop publicly commenting about this case; correct?

A Yes.

Q And you mentioned earlier today that you previously had an attorney named Lanny Davis?

A Yes, I had an attorney named Lanny Davis.

Q And during that time period, just let's talk now about 2021, so January forward in 2021, Mr. Davis was your lawyer; correct?

A Mr. Davis was one of my lawyers, yes.

Q Is Mr. Davis still your lawyer?

A No, sir.

Q But in 2021 he was?

A Yes.

Q When did he stop being your lawyer?

A In 2022.

Q So, do you remember in early January, January 15th of 2021, there was a leak to the Associated Press, and you and your lawyer, so you and Mr. Davis, both denied being the source of the leak and you communicated that to the District Attorney's Office; do you remember that?

A No. Can you identify something ——

Q Let me see if I have something that may refresh your recollection.

A Sure.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can show the witness, the Court and the parties B54.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.

Q Take a look at that, at that email, and let me know whether it refreshes your recollection about something your lawyer said to the District Attorney about you and him?

A I see that.

Q So does that refresh your recollection that in January 2021, your lawyer communicated to the District Attorney’s Office that neither you nor he were the source of a leak?

A That's what it says, yes.

Q Well, do you remember that happening? Do you remember a recollection of that happening, sir?

A I do not.

Q So, and do you recall Mr. Davis asking the line prosecutors to report to the top?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor. It’s hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q So let’s talk about ——

MR. BLANCHE: You can take that down. Thank you.

Q So let’s go one month later. So now we are in February, February 22nd of 2021. Do you remember your lawyer talking to you about something he had been told ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Well, do you remember at that time the District Attorney’s Office was frustrated that when they would say something to you or your lawyer about the investigation, you would talk about it on TV. Do you remember that happening?

A I do not recall that, no.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can show the witness, the Court and the parties B55.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.

Q Take a look at this email. You are not on this, Mr. Cohen, so if you could just take a look at the part that's not redacted and see if that refreshes your recollection about a conversation you had at that time?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness reading.

A Yes, I see that.

Q So, do you understand that, again, we are talking back a few years, I understand that, but February 22nd of 2021, there was concern that you were going on TV?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Can you please call up —— pull this up and make it a little larger, please.

MR. BLANCHE: Sure.

THE COURT: So I can look at it.

MR. BLANCHE: Can we blow up a portion of the email. Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Pause.

THE COURT: Can you read back the last question, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Record read by the court reporter in open court at this time.

THE COURT: Overruled. I will allow it. You can answer.

A From this document, yes.

MR. BLANCHE: We can take the document down, please.

Q With the document aside, do you remember in February 2021, you were going on TV talking about the investigation?

A I go on TV often, so I'm not sure what the topic was —— what was I responding to; I don't know.

Q Would it surprise you to learn that you were on TV talking about the investigation in February of 2021?

A No. It would not surprise me.

Q Now, do you remember making promises to your attorney that you would stop talking and stop going on TV?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can look at B56 just for the witness, the Court and the parties.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.

Q Have you had a chance to review that, Mr. Cohen?

A Do you want to tell me what you want me to review?

Q You can review just the entire text exchange on that page. And I understand that you are not on it, so just focus only on discussing you?

A It disappeared.

Q Pardon me?

A It disappeared from my screen.

Q Is it there?

A It's back.

Q Okay. Can you tell me who these communications are between? You are not on the communication, but do you see that your lawyer told ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Let me hear the question.

MS. HOFFINGER: He's reading something that's not in evidence.

Q You had told the District Attorney's office that you had promised that you were not going to talk anymore?

THE COURT: Sustained, sustained.

Q Mr. Cohen, do you remember, again, we are still talking about February 2021. Do you remember, at that time, the District Attorney's Office being frustrated with you that you would not stop talking to the press?

A Yes, sir.

Q But you continued to talk to the press, as you said a few minutes ago; correct?

A Yes. I continued to talk to the press.

Q And you continue to talk to the press to this day; correct?

A About many topics, yes.

Q Including about this case; correct, sir?

A Sounds correct, yes.

Q I don't want it to sound correct; is it correct?

A Yes, it would be correct.

Q Now, I want to talk now —— let's go fast forward two years, okay, so we were talking about February, 2021; let's move to February 2023, okay. So that was a little over a year and three months ago, about; correct? Okay?

A Yes.

Q You were, again, regularly meeting with the District Attorney's Office about this case; correct? In February of 2023?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you testified in the Grand Jury, you said earlier this morning, on March 13th, 2023; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q Now, prior to your testimony on March 13th, you testified earlier today that you gave two of your cell phones to an investigator with the District Attorney's office; correct?

A That's correct.

Q And that investigator's name was Jeremy Rosenberg; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And he came to where you live to retrieve the phone on two different days, so two phones, two different days; is that correct?

A That's correct.

Q And then just over a week later, do you recall that you went on CNN and told the news anchor named Don Lemon that you had been contacted by the District Attorney's Office and they had asked you to provide them with your cell phones and you had done so; do you remember doing that?

A Sounds correct.

Q And do you remember the District Attorney's Office being frustrated and upset that you had done that?

A No, sir.

Q You don't recall that the District Attorney's Office was frustrated that you went on TV to talk about the fact that you had turned over your phones?

A I don't recall them expressing that to me, no.

Q Do you recall —— do you recall saying that you did not tell Mr. Lemon or tell CNN that your phones had been seized, that they already had that information and you just confirmed it; correct?

A I —— I cannot agree with that, no, sir.

Q You —— so let me ask you this, are you the one that leaked to CNN that you had given your phones to the District Attorney earlier in January of 2023?

A I don't recall.

Q So you don't recall whether —— when you talked about it with Mr. Lemon, whether they already —— whether CNN already had that information or whether you gave it to them; you don't recall either way?

A I don't.

Q So take a look at B57 just again for Mr. Cohen, the Court and the parties.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.

Q And this is a text message with the District Attorney's Office and your lawyer, again, again, you are not on these text messages, sir.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness reading.

Q Does that refresh your recollection that you said that CNN already had the info on the phones and all you did was confirm?

A No, sir. I don't recall.

Q If it was leaked to CNN and not by you, who else knew that the phones had been given to the District Attorney's Office?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A Or, clearly, Lanny Davis. It could be others. I don't know.

Q Well, does Mr. Rosenberg know?

A Yes, Mr. Rosenberg would know.

Q He picked them up; correct?

A He did.

Q And other members of the District Attorney's Office necessarily knew; correct? Right?

A Correct.

Q But you don't know, as you sit here today, you're not sure whether you leaked that or somebody else leaked that?

A That's what I stated, yes.

Q And then, again, still talking about last year on March 19th, 2023 —— which, by the way, you testified in the Grand Jury on March 13th; correct?

A I believe so, yes.

Q So March 19th, six days later, you recall that once again, your —— the District Attorney's Office was frustrated and upset that you were continuing to talk on TV; correct?

A No, sir. I don't recall that either.

Q And you actually promised at that point, that you would stop going on TV, you would do no more appearances on TV until after the indictment; correct?

A Again, I don't recall that.

MR. BLANCHE: Well, can we take a look at B58. Again, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.

Q And this, again, sir, you are not on this text, this is with the District Attorney's Office and your lawyer.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness reading.

Q Does that refresh your recollection that you promised that you would make no more appearances on TV until after the indictment?

A No, sir.

Q So, just so I understand, you testified yesterday about very specific recollections that you have about telephone calls, for example, with President Trump in 2016, but you have no recollection of whether last March —— so just over a year ago, you promised the District Attorney that you would stop going on TV; that's your testimony?

A What I'm saying to you, sir, is that I don't recall even having this conversation with Lanny Davis about not going on television.

Q So you don't recall a year ago, making a promise that you would no longer go on TV until after the indictment?

A No, sir.

Q But you recall very specifically multiple telephone conversations that you had with President Trump in 2016; correct?

A I recall the conversations with President Trump at the time, yes.

Q Do you recall a telephone call last year in March before the indictment with you, your lawyer and the District Attorney's Office where they emphasized how important it was for you to stop talking to the —— to the TV and stop going on TV?

A No, sir. I do not recall that either. Because I don't recall ever agreeing not to go on television.

Q You don't recall the District Attorney telling you that you were unwittingly helping President Trump by going on TV?

A No, sir.

Q Now, you talked a little bit about Mr. Costello earlier today, the attorney that you were speaking with after you were raided by the FBI in about June of that year; correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you remember last year in March during the Grand Jury phase of this case, you were called down as a possible rebuttal witness for Mr. Costello; correct?

A I believe so, yes.

Q Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that you were called down to the District Attorney's Office on March 20th as a possible rebuttal witness?

A Yes, sir, I remember.

Q You were?

A I do, yes.

Q And do you remember going on TV that very night and saying that you didn't need to testify as a rebuttal witness because the DA determined that Costello's testimony lacked any veracity; do you remember saying that?

A I do.

Q And then after the indictment, you have been warned repeatedly by the District Attorney's Office to not talk about this case; correct?

A Yes.

Q What have they said to you?

A Please don't talk about the case.

Q That's all they said? They just call you up and say, Please don't talk about the case; that's it?

A Actually, they contacted my attorney.

Q And when you meet with them —— you met with them, putting aside the past month or two, going back to last summer, you met with them on multiple occasions; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And when they meet with you, do they tell you, not just your attorney, to not talk about the case?

A They have said it to me, yes.

Q So when they say it to you, not to your attorney, what do they say?

A Probably better off if you don't speak about it.

Q They say it's probably better off if you don't speak about it?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A That's how I recall it, yes.

Q So they don't direct you not to speak, they just say it's probably better you don't speak?

A Well, I do have the First Amendment right. I can speak.

Q I'm not asking you about your First Amendment rights, Mr. Cohen, I'm asking you what these Prosecutors say to you about not speaking to the press, and your testimony was they just say, probably better if you don't speak?

A They say it in a manner where they're asking me not to speak.

Q And on how many occasions over the past year, so since the indictment, have they said to you directly, not through your lawyer, you directly, do not speak to the press?

A I don't recall.

Q Well, I won't give you, not an exact number, do you think it's more than five?

A I don't think so, no.

Q So fewer than five times?

A Yes.

Q And on all those five times, they said something like, it's probably better you don't talk or don't talk to the press; correct?

A Correct.

Q And you have not followed their request, or whatever words you want me to use for what they're saying to you?

A That's correct. I'm responding to comments that I make and also ——

Q I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you a yes or no question. Now, is it fair to say that you've responded during the course of this case, so since the indictment, but also during the investigation —— during the investigation, you've gone on TV several dozen times; is that fair?

A I don't know about several dozen times, but I have gone on television.

Q Well, is it more than 20?

A Could be.

Q Well, do you have any doubt in your mind that it's more than 20, sir?

A No.

Q So when you say it "could be," you mean, yes, it is more than 20?

A Yes, could be.

Q And you've also recorded hundreds of episodes of the Podcast you just talked about earlier today?

A Yes, sir.

Q You do that Podcast twice a week; is that right?

A Each Podcast is done twice a week.

Q So that’s four Podcasts a week?

A Correct.

Q And is that —— I mean, is that all year long or are there breaks?

A All year long.

Q So that’s about, how many a month? About 15 to 20 a month depending? Do you always do two a week?

A Uh—huh; correct.

Q So it's fair to say that you have done hundreds of Podcast episodes during the investigation and during the charges —— since the case has been charged; correct?

A I don’t know about hundreds, but, yes, the math is the math.

Q Well, we can do the math?

A Okay.

Q I mean, if there’s 16 a month?

A Right.

Q Ten months is 160; right?

A Then it would be 160.

Q So —— and this investigation didn’t just start a year ago; did it?

A No, it did not.

Q So when I say hundreds, it’s more than 200; correct?

A Yes.

Q Now, and of those more than 200 episodes, would you agree that you have talked about President Trump every single one?

A I would say he is mentioned in every one, yes.

Q And in addition to the Podcasts, which we will talk about a little bit more in a little bit, you also are active on Twitter and on X; is that right?

A That's correct.

Q And you are also active, although maybe more recently, on TikTok; correct?

A Correct.

Q And TikTok, you do a nightly live TikTok; correct?

A Correct.

Q How long is that each night?

A More than an hour.

Q What's the goal of doing that?

A Build an audience to create a community, to really vent because I am having a difficult time sleeping so I found an outlet.

Q You are hoping also to make money off that; correct?

A It does make money, but it's not significant.

Q You don't spend a significant amount of time on your TikToks encouraging the folks listening to subscribe?

A Yes.

Q So to subscribe they have to pay a small fee; correct?

A $5.99.

Q A month?

A Yes.

Q A month? A month?

A Yes.

Q Right. So I'm not suggesting that that's the only reason you do it, and I accept that you do it as an outlet, but one of the reasons you do it is to make money; correct?

A Money is made from it, yes.

Q So that wasn't my question. One of the reasons you do it is to make money, yes or no?

A Yes.

Q And on your TikToks —— let me just start with that. When did you start that?

A Six weeks ago.

Q So for the six weeks that you have been TikToking nightly, out of seven nights a week, how many nights do you think you talk about President Trump?

A Well, I only do them six days a week.

Q Okay. Fair enough.

A I would say six days a week.

Q And on X, you regularly talk about President Trump; correct?

A I speak about Mr. Trump, yes.

Q Both in response to comments, but also when you re— tweet or when you post your own; correct?

A Yes.

Q Now, you’ve also commented on your Political Beat Down Podcast —— so you have Mea Culpa, and you have Political Beat Down; correct?

A Correct.

Q You’ve commented on March 19th, 2024, so before the case started, but about two months ago, that you were meeting with the Government in preparation for your testimony, which started yesterday; correct?

A Correct.

Q And you also, actually, displayed a binder, do you recall doing that, a binder of materials that the District Attorney had given you to study before your testimony; correct?

A I recall that binder.

Q What’s in that binder?

A Publicly—available documents that the District Attorney’s Office provided to me.

Q Which publicly—available documents?

A I believe my allocution, and other documents regarding the case. My personal case.

Q So your allocution, meaning your guilty —— you had two guilty plea allocutions; correct?

A Correct.

Q So you mean like your guilty plea allocutions, certain materials in connection with your case; is that what you're saying?

A Correct, yes.

Q And they asked you to study that; correct?

A They gave it to my attorney. I took it from my attorney to bring home to read.

Q And you read it; correct?

A It was awhile ago, yes.

Q Well, you were talking about it on your Podcasts, March 19th, so when you say awhile ago, you mean within the past couple of months?

A Correct.

Q You've also talked about, extensively, on Mea Culpa, your desire to see that President Trump gets convicted in this case; correct?

A Sounds like something I would say.

Q Well, sir, I'm not asking you if it sounds to like something you would say, I'm saying, did you —— have you regularly commented on your Podcasts that you want President Trump to be convicted in this case?

A Yes, probably.

Q Do you have any doubt?

A No.

Q So why did you just answer "yes, probably"?

A Because I don't specifically know if I used those words, but, yes, I would like to see that.

Q And so, yes, you want to see President Trump get convicted from this case; correct?

A I would like to see accountability. That's not —— it's not for me, it's for the jury and this Court.

Q I didn't ask what you wanted to see or not see about accountability; I said, do you want to see President Trump convicted in this case?

A That's what we just said. You are asking me if I want to see ——

Q I'm just asking you to say yes or no, do you want President Trump to get convicted in this case?

A Sure.

Q Now, you actually —— and the Prosecutor brought this up a little bit before lunch today —— you sell a T—shirt on your website Mea Culpa, which depicts President Trump in an orange jumpsuit behind bars; correct?

A Yes, sir.

MR. BLANCHE: Can we put up just for the witness, the Court and the parties B151.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed to the aforementioned parties only.

Q So this is a couple of pages. It's from your website. If we could scroll to the next page. The next page. The next page. I believe that's the last page; that other page. So you see that when you —— if somebody logs onto the website for your Podcast, that's what you see; correct, for the merchandise pages; correct?

A It's actually under the MeidasTouch network and, yes, if you go into the section that says "Mea Culpa, "this shirt is available for sale.

Q Fair enough. So under the company that runs your Podcast, there is a Mea Culpa —— which is your Podcast; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q —— merchandise store and that's what appears?

A That's one item.

Q That's what?

A Just, that's one item.

Q Well, if we go to the second page, if we could. And then the third page, and then the last page, those are the other items there; correct?

A Some of them, yes.

Q There are others beyond this?

A I thought there were more items.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we offer 8151.

THE COURT: Any objection?

MS. HOFFINGER: No objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right. In evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: So marked in evidence.

MR. BLANCHE: So if we can just display that to the jury, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q So this is a 32 dollar shirt on your website. And it has a picture of President Trump in an orange jumpsuit behind bars; correct?

A That's what the picture shows, yes.

MR. BLANCHE: And if we can go to the fourth page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q So you see something for sale called "Convict 45."

A I see that.

Q And that's about a reference to "45." President Trump is our 45th President; correct?

A Correct.

Q And if you see ——

MR. BLANCHE: If we can blow up the bottom.

Q —— the coffee mug as well.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q That says, "Send him to the Big House not the White House;" correct?

A That's what it says.

Q And that's also a reference to President Trump; correct?

A Correct.

Q So when you testified earlier today that you only sell one thing on your —— merchandise that has to do with Donald Trump, that's not true; correct?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q And, by the way ——

MR. BLANCHE: If you can go back to the first page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q You, actually —— if you look at that, the T—shirt, you actually wore that T—shirt last week on your TikTok, didn't you, on Wednesday night?

A I did.

Q And you were offering —— encouraging people to go buy it; correct?

A Yes. It's part of the merch store.

Q So, I want to talk for a few minutes —— you talked about this a little bit on direct —— about your views of President Trump prior to, I guess, August of 2018; is that right?

A (Witness indicating.)

Q Well, you tell me, when did you change your views about President Trump, from the views you had for your entire life to the views that you have now?

A It would be August of 2018.

Q Well, I will take back saying August. I don't want to put words in your mouth. When was it that you changed your view about President Trump from what it is now prior to what it was your entire life, which is different than it is now?

A It was the time —— at the time that I went on George Stephanopoulos.

Q And was that around the summertime, July, August of 2018?

A Correct.

Q But, prior to that —— and you said this on direct, so I'm not saying, I don't think, anything controversial, but you enjoyed working for President Trump; correct?

A Very much so.

Q And you first met President Trump and his family in 2006; is that right?

A Yes.

Q And that was during a Board dispute that was going on at one of President Trump's buildings; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you helped resolve that?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you were working with one of President Trump’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr., on that; is that right?

A Amongst other people, yes.

Q Now, there was construction going on at a —— at one of President Trump’s apartments that you had purchased; is that right?

A Yes.

Q That —— and you paid close to $5 million for that apartment; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q And that apartment was your primary residence for many years; correct?

A Yes, it is.

Q Still is?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you still live in a building with Trump’s name on it; correct?

A I do.

Q Now, you had already invested in other Trump properties; correct?

A Yes, Sir.

Q You had property in Trump World Tower?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you rented that out to somebody for $15,000 a month; correct?

A Yes, sir, to an Embassy.

Q That was back in 2006, we are talking about?

A Sure.

Q A lot of your family members also bought properties in Trump buildings; correct?

A My in—laws and my parents.

Q So your parents and your in—laws both bought Trump properties; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q Was that even earlier, or was that earlier, like 2001?

A The year 2000. We bought as a block.

Q Now, talking about the dispute that you first helped President Trump and his family resolve, the Board was trying to remove the Trump name from the building; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q There were lawyers involved, including you eventually; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q That's when you were a partner at a law firm in the City, you talked about that earlier, Phillips Nizer?

A Yes, sir.

Q Correct me if I’m wrong, your practice at the time was international banking, asset—based lending, high—net—worth client asset protection, general corporate commercial real estate and letter of credit transactions; is that right?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you were —— would you say you were more in litigation or corporate?

A More corporate.

Q But aside from your work as a practicing lawyer at Phillips Nizer, you made a lot of money in the taxi medallions business; correct?

A Correct.

Q You made millions of dollars; fair?

A Yes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Continued from the previous page.

Q And you viewed yourself at the time —— so, again, talking about the early Two Thousands —— as a bit of a dealmaker?

A Yes, sir.

Q So, you used your skills as a lawyer, dealmaker, your work in business, to help The Trump Organization before you worked with them; correct?

A I’m sorry. I don’t understand your question.

Q Well, my point is, that you had success helping The Trump Organization before you started working for them, which is, presumably, why they offered you a job; correct?

A Oh, I don’t know if that’s the reason.

Q Well, you said yesterday that you knew that from your work on that, that President Trump was happy with your work; correct?

A He was happy with the result, yes.

Q And after that first result, you started working on other —— on other legal matters for President Trump; correct?

A I was asked to intercede in other matters as well; yes.

Q And at some point, President Trump offered you a job; correct?

A Correct.

Q And he offered you a job right then and there; you accepted; you never even returned to Phillips, Nizer; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q So, you were President Trump's personal attorney when you went to work for The Trump Organization; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q You didn’t answer to the General Counsel at the time; did you?

A No, sir.

Q You never answered to anybody in the Legal Department or anybody else at the Trump Organization; you only answered to President Trump?

A Correct.

Q You —— but, your job wasn’t just representing President Trump; right? You also represented his family at times?

A I have, yes.

Q Well, I want to stay focused on the time when you started until 20 —— 2017. So, those nine—and—a—half years that you were there, you represented the family on occasion?

A Yes.

Q That includes which members of President Trump’s family?

A Melania. Don, Junior. Um. I don’t believe I ever represented Eric. And I can’t recall if I represented Ivanka.

Q Putting aside —— you would also help some of the kids with various work, maybe not legal work and filing lawsuits, but, for example, reaching out to the media on behalf of President Trump’s children; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you were paid —— just focusing now on 2011 to 2016, you made about 375,000 a year in base salary; right?

A That's correct.

Q With the exception of 2016, your bonus for those years, 2011 to 2015, was 150,000 a year; right?

A Correct.

Q That's what you would get in a check around the holiday season, around Christmastime; correct?

A Correct.

Q Now, fair to say that you admired President Trump while you were working for him?

A Yes, sir.

Q You admired his financial success, his high profile, his tenacity?

A Very much so, yes.

Q You’ve read Art of the Deal, I believe, twice; is that correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you view that as a masterpiece; correct?

A I viewed it as a excellent book, yes.

Q Well, you've actually called it a masterpiece; correct?

A Yes. Masterpiece.

Q And you saw a little bit of yourself in President Trump; correct?

A Correct.

Q Ambitious, hard—working, dealmaker, never afraid; correct?

A Innovative. Yes.

Q And you were actually obsessed with President Trump; weren't you?

A I don't know if I would characterize the word "obsessed". I admired him tremendously.

Q Well, you have characterized it as you being "obsessed"; haven't you?

A I can't recall using that word, but I wouldn‘t say that that would be wrong, but I don't recall using that word.

Q Sorry. I interrupted you. In Disloyal, you described —— you describe your feelings for President Trump as being "obsessed" with President Trump, with Donald J. Trump; correct?

A Correct.

Q And, we talked a lot about when you were working for him. But, your obsession for —— you admired him even before you started working for him; correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you spoke publicly on many occasions about your positive feelings for President Trump; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q You've said —— just for some examples, in 2015, you publicly said he was a good man?

A Yes.

Q Also in 2015, this is around the time he announced he was running for President, you said that he’s a man who cares deeply about this country; right?

A I said that.

Q That he’s a man who tells it straight?

A Yes, sir.

Q Now, you also said —— again, I’m still in 2015 —— that, in your view, President Trump speaks from the heart?

A I’ve said that.

Q And that all that he wants to do is make this country great again. You said that?

A Sounds right, yes.

Q And at the time, you weren’t lying; right?

A At that time, I was knee—deep into the cult of Donald Trump; yes.

Q So, let me ask the question again. At that time, you weren’t lying; right?

A I was not lying, no. That’s how I felt.

Q You’ve —— you’ve said about —— for example, about President Trump’s memory, that it’s fantastic and that you’ve never come into a situation where he’s said something that’s not accurate; correct?

A I recall saying that.

Q This is in 2015. Just so I understand, you’re not testifying that when you said that, you were lying; right?

A Correct.

Q So, in 2015, when you said those things that I just went through, you were telling the truth?

A That's how I felt.

Q You were telling the truth; correct?

A That’s how I felt.

Q Well ——

A I was expressing my feelings. So, yes, it would be the truth.

Q You also testified a little bit on direct —— and now we’re getting into 2016 —— that you served as a surrogate to the campaign; correct?

A Correct.

Q And one of the things that you did in September of 2016 is you delivered remarks in Cleveland, Ohio about President Trump; right?

A I did, yes.

Q Can you tell us about —— so, were you one of many speakers that day?

A I was one of several, yes.

Q Now, when you were speaking, President Trump was there?

A Yes, sir.

Q And did President Trump also speak, as well?

A I believe so, yes.

Q And you remember telling the —— how large was the crowd? What was the venue?

A The venue was the New Spirit Revival Church. It was run by my co—creator of the National Diversity Coalition, Pastor Darrell Scott, and it was a good hundred people there.

Q During your speech, you described President Trump as generous; do you remember that?

A I did.

Q Compassionate, principled, empathetic; do you remember saying all that?

A Correct.

Q Kind, humble, genuine; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q The same question I asked you before. When you said that back in September of 2016, you were telling the truth?

A Again, that’s how I felt. So, yes, it would be the truth.

Q Now, moving a little bit forward to 2017, do you recall a Vanity Fair profile that was done about you in 2017, in September?

A I’m sorry. Can you repeat that?

Q Sorry. Do you recall a Vanity Fair profile that was done in September of 2017?

A I do.

Q And do you remember saying —— and that was an article that you participated in; right?

A Written by Emily Jane Fox.

Q And you said that you were the guy that stops the leaks, talking about who you were as it relates to President Trump; correct?

A Correct.

Q And you said that you were the guy who protects the the President and the family; right?

A I believe so.

Q Excuse me?

A I believe so, yes.

Q And you also said at that point that you would take a bullet for the President?

A I did say that, yes.

Q You also talked about, at that time —— and, again, this is September 2017. You said that towards the end of the campaign, that you were offered book deals; correct?

A I was offered a book deal, yes.

Q So, you were offered —— I believe you said you were offered $10 million to write a tell—all book; is that right?

A I believe so, yes.

Q And you said that —— what you said in the article is that your counteroffer was, "How about a hundred million?"; correct?

A Correct.

Q According to the article, at the time, there was no number that worked for you; right?

A That's correct.

Q You —— you were just pushing them to see how high they would go in a book offer; right?

A No. That’s not true.

Q No? I wasn't trying to fight with you there. You were just going back at them to say there’s no number in the world that you would agree to to write a book about President Trump?

A Correct.

Q And, again, when you said that, that was true; you had no intention of writing a book?

A I had no intention of writing a book.

Q At that time, in 2017?

A At that time.

Q And you also said, not only about President Trump, but there was no money in the world that would cause you to write about his family; correct?

A Sounds correct, yes.

Q You said there’s no money in the world that could get you to disclose anything about the family; right?

A Okay.

Q You described them at the time, in 2017, talking about the family, as a surrogate family of yours; correct?

A Correct.

Q Now, we’re mid—2017 right now. So, September of 2017. And during that time —— so, that’s the first year that President Trump is in Office, when you are his Personal Counsel; correct?

A Correct.

Q You were not spending as much time with him then that you had spent with him the prior nine—and—a—half years; right?

A Correct.

Q So, you went from seeing him almost daily, except for when he was campaigning, to not seeing him nearly as much when he was in the White House; correct?

A Oh, that’s correct.

Q For example, you told Hope Hicks in June of 2017 that you missed him and that you missed being around the folks that you had worked with for years and years; correct?

A Yes, I did. I had a great relationship with my colleagues. And I did say that I missed President Trump. In fact, he said the same thing at a rally —— well, I shouldn’t say a rally. It was a fundraiser in Washington, D.C.

Q Now, you —— at some point, because of the investigation —— you talk about, on direct, there was an ongoing investigation, and there was some separation placed between you and President Trump; right?

A Yes. There was a separation.

Q And you spoke about that. You spoke about the fact that it was frustrating to you that you weren’t able to communicate as often with President Trump or with the kids; correct?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A I’m sorry. Repeat that.

Q Of course. So, now talking about 2017. You publicly spoke about the fact that it was frustrating to you or you were disappointed that you weren’t able to spend as much time with President Trump’s children or President Trump because of the investigation?

A (Pause) I’m sorry. Where was that said?

Q So, let me ask it a different way. In the Fall of 2017, okay —— so, in September of 2017, there was an ongoing investigation; and one of the consequences of that was you were told you had to stay away and you shouldn’t communicate directly with President Trump or his family; correct?

A I was advised that I could not speak to President Trump, but not to the family.

Q Well, you don’t remember saying to Emily Fox in the reporting that: That’s the part that’s most disappointing, meaning not being able to see the President, I haven’t spoken to any of the kids?

A Correct. Not that I couldn’t see the kids. We just didn’t.

Q Well, you didn’t speak with the kids?

A Correct.

Q You then testified in Congress on October 24th of that year; correct?

A Correct.

Q And this is the testimony that you talked about on direct where you lied?

A That’s the 2017?

Q Yes. Sorry. So, October 24, 2017?

A Yes, sir.

Q Did you lie —— you identified the areas that you pled guilty to lying about, right, involving the Russia Project; correct?

A Correct.

Q Did you lie in other areas of your testimony or only that area of your testimony?

A I believe that’s —— (pause) —— part?

Q So, for example, you testified in front of Congress on that day that you were very proud to have served Donald Trump for all of those years and that you would continue to support him. That wasn't a lie; that was true?

A That was true.

Q Then —— we’ll come back to this in a little bit. In 2018, in April, the FBI raided your home office, safe deposit box, and the hotel room you were staying in; correct?

A That's correct.

Q After that time, you had one conversation on the phone, shortly thereafter, with President Trump; correct?

A Yes. The day after.

Q Now, a few weeks later —— so, April 26th of that same year, of 2018, do you recall saying on the phone that you really missed The Boss? You said, "Boss, I miss you so much. I wish I was down there with you. It’s really hard for me not to be there." Do you remember that?

A I don’t recall that.

Q If we can show you and see if we can refresh your recollection.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can look at B66 just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness’ and the parties' screens.

Q It’s an article. Take a look at that, and see if it refreshes your recollection.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

Q Does that article refresh your recollection that you said that?

A No. Um, what it states is that, according to this person —— I don’t know who the person is. And I don’t recall specifically saying that.

Q Fair enough. Now, at some point —— and —— around August of that year, so August of 2018, you started —— you decided that you were going to meet with the Special Counsel’s Office and tell them what you knew; correct? Cooperate?

A I was asked to cooperate, yes.

Q Well, you were asked to cooperate, but at some point you decided that you would cooperate; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you don't remember exactly when it was that you decided to cooperate?

A I don’t remember the specific date, no.

Q Was it —— so, you first met with the Special Counsel, with Mueller's Special Counsel on August 7, 2018; correct?

A Correct.

Q Had you decided at that point you were going to cooperate?

A I don't believe so.

Q So, in your mind, when you met with them, what were you thinking?

A Still to protect Mr. Trump, to provide answers that might have been deceptive.

Q And when you met with them that first time, you had lawyers with you; right?

A I did.

Q You had three lawyers with you?

A I believe so.

Q And there were —— there was an FBI agent?

A I don’t recall who was in the room. There was a lot of people in the room.

Q Understood.

MR. BLANCHE: Let’s take a look at A65, just for the witness, the parties and the Court.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness’ and the parties' screens.

MR. BLANCHE: If we could blow up just the first paragraph.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

Q There’s some redactions there, Mr. Cohen. See if that refreshes your recollection about whether there was an FBI agent there.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A Yes.

Q And there were three lawyers from the Special Counsel’s Office there; correct?

A Correct.

Q There was an Intelligence Analyst and a Forensics Analyst there, as well; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q New, you told —— at that first meeting, you gave a reason why you were gonna meet with them; right?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A I’m certain I did.

Q Well, you said, did you not, that your life had been turned upside—down since the release of the Steele dossier; right?

A Yes.

Q And you said to them that there was no truth to the allegations in that dossier; correct?

A That is correct.

Q And that you've never been to Prague?

A I have never been to Prague.

Q That’s one of the accusations made against you. Not true?

A That's not true.

Q You told them you never paid the Russians to hack anything?

A That’s correct.

Q That's true, you never did?

A Never did.

Q You told them that by speaking with them —— so, by speaking with the Special Counsel’s Office that day in August, that was a way for your voice to be heard; right?

A Correct.

Q And you wanted your voice to be part of the report when it was ultimately issued; right?

A I wanted my voice to be reflected that the Steele dossier, according to me, as an example, was inaccurate.

Q And you —— they told you at that meeting, the first meeting, I assume: You have to tell the truth?

A They did.

Q And they told you that lying to a Federal Agent was a Federal crime?

A I’m certain they did.

Q But, you didn’t have any doubt in your mind at the time that lying to them was a crime; did you?

A Correct.

Q And they asked you about all kinds of background information about —— about President Trump, about The Trump Organization, about the campaign, about the Inaugural Ball; correct?

A They asked me a lot of information, yes.

Q Now, they also asked you about the Trump Moscow Project, and you lied to them; right?

A (Pause) Yes. The information I gave was not accurate.

Q So, is "not accurate" information a lie?

A Sure.

Q I don't ——

A It’s not —— I mean ——

Q Is it a lie?

A It was inaccurate, yes.

Q So, was it a lie?

A I don't know if I would characterize it as "a lie". It was inaccurate.

Q So, in your mind, if something is inaccurate but it’s not a lie, how are you distinguishing that in your head?

A It wasn’t truthful. Yes. You want to call it a lie, I’ll call it a lie. It’s inaccurate.

Q I’m asking you to testify ——

A I believe they’re the same thing.

Q Pardon?

A I believe they’re the same thing. I believe that the information I gave to them was inaccurate.

Q But, you're not testifying today that that information was a lie?

A (Pause) Sure. I’ll say it’s a lie.

Q Well ——

A I’ll say it's a lie.

Q I'm just asking questions, Mr. Cohen.

A No problem. And I’m trying to give you the answer.

Q Okay. Fair enough. So, when you testified inaccurately or didn’t testify truthfully or lied —— whichever word you want to use —— about the Moscow Project, okay, that was one of many things you talked about that day; right?

A I believe so, yes.

Q Do you recall lying about anything else or were you only lying about that? Or being inaccurate? Whatever word.

A I —— I don’t know. I'd have to refresh my memory to see what the document is, but I specifically recall the number of times that I claimed to have spoken to Mr. Trump, which I was doing for his benefit and, in essence, at his direction.

Q But, ultimately —— but, ultimately, what the Special Counsel made you plead guilty to from your lies to Congress, right, had to do only with the Moscow Project; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q And you never had to plead guilty to a false statements charge from when you lied in this meeting on August 7th; did you?

A No, sir.

Q Now, did they also —— you were also asked on that date, on August 7, 2018, about the Access Hollywood videotape and audiotape; weren’t you?

A I believe so.

Q And you —— you testified that you —— excuse me. You told them on August 7th that you were in London; right?

A I was.

Q You were visiting your daughter?

A Yes, sir.

Q And that you were at dinner at a place called Lulu’s?

A That's correct.

Q Then you told them, much like you testified to yesterday, that after you received the call, you made a bunch of phone calls to folks in the media; correct?

A Correct.

Q But, you told them on August 7, 2018 that you didn’t recall speaking with President Trump about the tape; correct?

A (Pause) I don't recall that.

MR. BLANCHE: Well, let's put up B65. We had that on the screen. Not for the jury.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness’ and the parties' screens.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can turn to Page 18 of that.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

Q If you can take a look at that section that talks about the Access Hollywood tape, and see if it refreshes your recollection.

A Sir, it states ——

Q Sir, you can't read from the document.

A Okay.

Q Sorry. It’s against the rules.

A Your question to me or your statement is inaccurate.

Q Why is it inaccurate? Without looking at the document, if your memory is refreshed.

A Yes, it was. "Cohen might have spoken to Trump about it." That’s what it says.

Q Well, if you look before that, right, if you look before that, it says: You don’t recall, but you might have; right?

A Yes, sir.

Q So, when you testified —— so, when you met with the Special Counsel on August 7th, 2018, you told them you didn’t recall, you might have spoken with President Trump; but, you testified yesterday, right, that you had a specific recollection of speaking with President Trump about the Access Hollywood tape; right? You testified about that yesterday?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection as to form.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q So, when you met with the Special Counsel on August 7, 2018, that was about two years after the Access Hollywood tape had been released; correct?

A Correct.

Q And when you testified yesterday —— many years later; correct?

A Correct.

Q And when you testified yesterday, you testified that you had a specific recollection about speaking with President Trump that day; right?

A Correct.

Q You said that you remember a phone call with Hope Hicks that President Trump was on?

A I said that, yes.

Q And that you remembered a separate phone call with President Trump, as well; right?

A I believe so, yes.

Q Well, do you have any doubt that you said that yesterday?

A No.

Q But, you didn't have that clear of a recollection when you met with Special Counsel August 7th; did you?

A It was being deceptive. Or, I might have. So, I left the door open because I didn’t want, again, to have his name in it because I was trying to be protective.

Q So, at that point, if you did say that, you couldn’t recall, or you might have, as opposed to remembering specifics like you did yesterday, it would have been because you were still being deceptive; is that your testimony?

A I was trying to be loyal to President Trump.

Q You were still being loyal to President Trump at the time?

A Yes, sir.

Q But, you don't remember anything else in that meeting with the Special Counsel on August 7th that wasn’t truthful, except for the Trump Moscow Project; is that correct?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q So, you —— we’ll talk a little about this a little bit more. You testified earlier today you had two separate guilty pleas in the Southern District of New York; correct?

A Correct.

Q One, August 21st of 2018?

A Yes, sir.

Q And then August 29th of 2018?

A Yes, sir.

Q November 29th was when you pled guilty to lying to Congress; is that right?

A That's right.

Q The August 21st was the guilty plea in front of Judge Pauley, with all the other conduct you talked about earlier today; correct?

A Correct.

Q After November 29, 2018, you were sentenced December 12, 2018; correct?

A That’s correct.

Q Then you testified in front of a couple of different Congressional Committees in between your sentencing and the time that you surrendered to serve your sentence; correct?

A Correct.

Q Now, by that time, by the time you testified in February of 2019, you had changed your views about President Trump; correct?

A Correct.

Q You testified on February 27th completely differently than your prior public statements about President Trump; correct?

A I’m sorry. Can you repeat that?

Q So, you had been talking for years and years about your views of President Trump. You testified in Congress that you had committed to work with him and continued to do so. But, once you testified February of 2019, you changed all that, and you now said that President Trump was a con man and that you were ashamed; correct?

A I said that, yes.

Q Now, you were initially supposed to surrender to serve your sentence March 6th of 2019; right?

A Correct.

Q And your lawyers asked the Judge for more time to surrender. So, from March 6th until May; right?

A I just had surgery, yes.

Q So, it was because you were recovering from a medical issue; right?

A Correct.

Q And because you were going to testify in front of the Committees we just talked about, as well; right?

A No, sir. It was because I had surgery.

Q It wasn’t because you were going to testify in front of the Committees, as well?

A No.

Q So ——

A I did testify before the Committee. But, that wasn’t the reason —— the reason I was given the 60 days is because I had shoulder surgery.

Q Now, you —— you —— prior to going into prison in May, you had never met with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office; right?

A That's correct.

Q The first time you met with members of the District Attorney’s Office was while you were at Otisville, in prison; right?

A Correct.

Q And you had been at Otisville since early May 2019; right?

A May 6th.

Q And just so the jury knows, Otisville, that's 90 miles away from here, give or take?

A Give or take.

Q About an hour—and—a—half from New York City?

A Approximately.

Q And you were very much looking, in the Fall of 2019, for a way to get your sentence reduced; correct?

A Yes, sir.

Q And you had visitors who came to see you?

A Yes.

Q Do you know someone named Anthony Scaramucchi?

A I do.

Q Did he come visit you in October of 2019?

A He came to visit. I don’t know exactly when.

Q And he commented and said that you were trying to figure out a way to get out of prison early; right?

A (No response).

Q You talked to him about that; right?

A Sounds correct.

Q And between August 2019 and October 2019, you met in person with Prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office on three occasions; is that right?

A In Otisville?

Q In Otisville.

A Yes, sir.

Q August 27th; sound right?

A (Nods yes).

Q September 19th?

A Sounds correct.

Q And then in October, October 30th; right?

A Also correct.

Q And prior to you meeting with them, you understood from talking to your lawyers —— I don’t want to hear what they said to you —— but, you understood that your lawyers had communications with the District Attorney’s Office?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. Is this a great time to take a break?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: All right, jurors. I’ll see you in about 15 minutes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.

THE COURT: Sir, you can step out.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness is excused.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, a recess is taken.) ~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k~k*~k*~k*~k~k~k*~k*~k*~k~k~k*~k*~k*~k~k~

THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

THE COURT: Jurors, I just want to discuss scheduling for one moment before we continue. As you know, we're not meeting tomorrow because it’s Wednesday. I also remind you, we’re not going to be meeting this Friday. The last thing is, I’m told one of your fellow jurors has a commitment Thursday afternoon, so we’re only going to work until 4 o’clock on Thursday. You may proceed.

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q So, we were talking about the first time you met with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Prosecutors was in Otisville, late August, August 27th of 2019; right?

A Correct.

Q So, you had been in —— at Otisville for a little over three months; is that correct?

A Correct.

Q Early May of 2019?

A Correct.

Q Do you recall, one of the things you wanted to talk to the Prosecutors about when you were in Otisville was what the benefit was to you for meeting with them; right?

A I did ask that.

Q And you told them that you had been screwed over by the system; correct?

A I don’t know if that's the language I used, but sounds correct.

MR. BLANCHE: Well, let’s put up, if we can, just for the witness, the Court, and the parties, B95. B, as in boy, 95.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the witness’ and the parties’ screens.

Q These are notes, not your notes, Mr. Cohen. And you can —— if you can look at just the first couple of lines about —— so, there’s two initial lines and then a blank space. You can look at the next four lines and see if you can make out what’s read there —— what’s written there, rather?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A Okay.

Q So, you wanted to know why you should meet with them; correct?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A Are you looking at the line that says: Why are you here?

Q Um —— I was actually looking two above that.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A (No response).

Q You can put that aside, Mr. Cohen. It’s fine. We’ll just ask questions.

A Okay.

Q You wanted to know what the benefit was to you for being there?

A (Nods yes).

Q Which was fair.

A Correct.

Q The reason why —— I want to make sure I have this right. You were sentenced December 12th of 2018; right?

A Correct.

Q And we’re now in August of 2019; right?

A (Nods yes).

Q That we’re talking about a meeting at the DA’s Office; right?

A Yes.

Q Are you familiar with a Rule 35 Motion in Federal Court?

A I am.

Q And you understand that a Rule 35 Motion, at times, gives the Judge who sentences you the right to give you a lower sentence if certain things happen; like, potentially, cooperation; right?

A That was something that Judge Pauley issued in his decision.

Q And Judge Pauley is the Federal Judge who sentenced you; right?

A Correct.

Q So, you understood —— well —— but, you understood, did you not, that a Rule 35 Motion has to be made within one year of sentence unless certain privileges pertain, right, or apply?

A At the time I did not know that, no.

Q At the time —— well, did you later learn that?

A I did later learn that, yes.

Q Was it later than 2019 you learned that?

A Yes.

Q During the time the motions —— when the motion was actually filed by your lawyers; correct?

A Correct.

Q So, when you were meeting with the District Attorney's Office for the first time, you asked them what’s in it for you, but you also asked them for their timeline; correct?

A I apologize. Timeline of what?

Q Well, that was going to be my question, Mr. Cohen. You asked them what their timeline was for this investigation; correct?

A I don't recall that; no, sir.

Q Did you want to understand from them how long it was going to take them to bring charges?

A I don’t recall asking that.

Q I’m not asking you whether you recall asking that or answering that. I’m asking you, at the time —— so, August of 2019, did it matter to you how long it was gonna take the District Attorney to bring charges?

A (Pause) No, sir.

Q It didn’t?

A I didn’t —— I didn’t ask that, and they didn’t discuss that with me.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari relieves Senior Court Reporter Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the proceedings were continued from the previous page:) ~k~k~

CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q. Okay. I’m not asking if you asked it or discussed it. Did it matter to you how long it would take for charges to be brought in this case?

A. I didn’t consider it at the time; no, sir.

Q. So, you didn’t say in August 2019, "What is your timeline?"

A. I don’t recall saying that; no, sir.

Q. Now, you recall that your lawyers had asked them —— Okay. I’m not asking if you asked it or discussed it. Did it matter to you how long it would take for charges to be brought in this case?

A. I didn’t consider it at the time; no, sir.

Q. So, you didn’t say in August 2019, "What is your timeline?"

A. I don’t recall saying that; no, sir.

Q. Now, you recall that your lawyers had asked them whether they would help write a Rule 35 motion with you then?

A. I am sorry. Once again.

Q. Do you recall a conversation when they were meeting with you, when the District Attorney was meeting with you in Otisville, about whether the District Attorney would be helping to write the Rule 35 motion?

A. My lawyers may have answered that. I didn't ask for it.

Q. I didn't say that you did. You were there when they were meeting with you, so while you were there with your lawyers in the District Attorney's office, do you remember a conversation where your lawyers asked the District Attorney whether they would be willing to help with the Rule 35 motion in Federal Court?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. Is it fair to say —— I know this goes back a couple of years —— but the District Attorney didn't commit to anything; right?

A. No, sir.

Q. They didn't say, yes, we'll do it, but they didn't say, no, we won't; they didn't commit; correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So, eventually, you met with the District Attorney again on September 19th for the second time in Otisville?

A. They came to Otisville.

Q. Then, again, on October 30th; correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then in December, your lawyers, in fact, did make a Rule 35 motion in the Southern District of New York; correct?

A. They did.

Q. Your lawyer at the time was somebody named Roger Adler?

A. Roger Adler.

Q. You had retained Roger Adler in August, a few months prior; is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. And Mr. Adler put a motion in to the Federal Court asking for a Rule 35 reduction in sentence; correct?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And you reviewed that paperwork before it was submitted; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So, the basis for you, through your lawyer, asking the Federal Judge to give you a lower sentence was because of your cooperation; is that right?

A. As well as the earlier cooperation, yes.

Q. So, it was the cooperation with the Special Counsel's Office; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. The cooperation with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office the three times you met with them; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And then, was it also the cooperation with the Southern District of New York Prosecutors?

A. I don't recall the Souther District.

Q. I am sorry. We're talking about a lot of lawyers. You met with the Special Counsel Mueller's team; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You met with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You also met with prosecutors with the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney's Office?

A. I mean, they were there at the meetings with the Mueller investigation.

Q. And they mention ——

A. The Southern District of New York. It was not independent, correct.

Q. And nobody had signed you up to a Cooperation Agreement; right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And, to this day, you've never signed a Cooperation Agreement?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, that motion was not granted; correct?

A. It was not.

Q. So, the Judge, the Federal Judge denied your request to have a reduction of sentence; correct?

A. Yes, it was denied.

Q. But, a little bit later —— so now, as we move forward, we're talking about May of 2020, May 21st, as you testified earlier, you were released to home confinement because of the Corona Virus?

A. Correct.

Q. And, thereafter, you started speaking to the media pretty regularly; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you started what you, I believe, called the Redemption Tour; is that fair?

A. Fair.

Q. And one of the things that you did in September of 2020 was your first book was launched called Disloyal; right?

A. Correct.

Q. That was September 8, 2020; correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, right around that time, you also launched your podcast that you talked about, Mea Culpa?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, you, on your podcast —— that started September 14th, 2020; does that sound right?

A. Sounds correct.

Q. On your first podcast, Mea Culpa, you referred to President Trump as a boorish cartoon misogynist; didn't you?

A. It sounds like something I would say.

Q. And those types of comments and names continued on, every single one, throughout 2020; correct?

A. I’m sure I said something. I can’t say that they are all ——

Q. You recall the first one in 2020 as a Cheeto—dusted cartoon villain?

A. That also sounds like something I said.

Q. Now, do you recall around that same time, October of 2020, you started talking about your hope that President Trump would be convicted of a crime; correct?

A. I don't know if those are the exact words that I said, but the sentiment is correct.

Q. You think you might have said "I truly fucking hope that this man ends up in prison;" is that exact?

A. It sounds like my language on Mea Culpa.

Q. Just so I understand, this is now October 2020. The last time you had met with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office was about a year earlier; is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. So, you met with them three times in Otisville; you applied to get a sentence reduction, which was denied; then you were released because of the Corona Virus to your home, but you were still serving a federal sentence at that time; right?

A. Correct.

Q. It’s just that instead of being in Otisville, you were in your co—op?

A. Condo.

Q. Your condominium?

A. Condo.

Q. I believe you have headphones right to your right, and I think the parties do as well. I am going to ask you to put the headphones on. I would like to play a portion of B25, which is a Mea Culpa —— a portion of the Mea Culpa podcast on October 23rd. Mr. Cohen, I would love to tell you how to use them.

A. You turn the very top up.

Q. Point it towards—— do you hear it? You heard that, Mr. Cohen?

A. I had heard that.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness, Michael Cohen, listened with headphones to above—referenced audio recording.

MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, may we approach for a moment?

THE COURT: Yes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following occurred sidebarz

MS. HOFFINGER: This tape is apparently an hour long. I could tell from the screen. I was just given the thumb drive. I haven't had a chance to review any of it. I don't have the rest of it.

THE COURT: She was just handed the thumb drive now?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes. I can just get back to this tomorrow. I am not looking to introduce a lot of things. Just two or three.

THE COURT: They haven't had chance to look at it.

MR. BLANCHE: I, literally, just gave it to them. I am happy to go on.

MS. HOFFINGER: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:

CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q. What you just heard was a portion ——

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.

THE COURT: I will allow him to clarify it.

MR. BLANCHE: Sorry for speaking.

Q. What you just heard is a portion of your podcast, Mea Culpa, from October 3, 2020; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You also said in that same podcast, did you not, that President Trump needs to wear handcuffs and to do the perp walk, people will not be satisfied until this man is sitting inside the cell; do you recall saying that?

A. I don't recall saying that, but I wouldn't put it past me.

Q. By the way, as of October 22, 2021, which is about a year after you had been —— you had started your podcast, you started in early September 2020. Now we're talking about October of 2021. Your podcast had topped ten million downloads; does that sound right?

A. I think it was more, but, yes.

Q. You said you think it was more. The average was around 300,000 a week; is that right?

A. Something like that, yes.

Q. I am sorry.

A. Something like that.

Q. And you make money off the podcast; correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then, by the way, is it fair to say that you are motivated by fame?

A. No, sir. I don't think that is fair to say.

Q. Is it fair to say you are motivated by publicity?

A. I don't know if that is fair to say. I am motivated by many things.

Q. So, do you recall saying in Disloyal, which is a book that you published the year before —— we're talking about now September of 2020. You published that book; right?

A. I did, yes.

Q. Do you recall saying that you had wealth, but that you wanted power, the good life, public acclaim, big deals, fast cars, private planes, the excesses and the glamour and zest for life; do you recall saying that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So, is that what motivates you, what I just read?

A. Yes, those are my words.

Q. You also, correct me if I am wrong, loved being on CNN, MSNBC, even Fox TV?

A. When I was speaking on behalf of Mr. Trump?

Q. Well, let's do both. Did you love it when you were speaking on behalf of President Trump?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you love it now?

A. Less, but yes, still do.

Q. So, the answer is yes, you love it, although just less now than you used to?

A. Yes.

Q. Fair to say that in the first few months after Disloyal was released, you had made about 2 million dollars off that book?

A. Sounds correct.

Q. You put that money into a Trust for your family; correct?

A. It went into a bank account.

Q. So, after meeting with the District Attorney three times in 2019, the last time being late October, you didn't meet with them again, so you didn't meet with the Manhattan prosecutors again until January 11, 2021; does that sound right?

A. They didn't ask to meet with me again until that date, yes.

Q. I didn't ask you whether they asked you to meet with them. My question was a lot more basic than that. Just, factually, between August 30, 2019 and January 11, 2020, you did not meet with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office?

A. No, sir.

Q. They didn't ask you to meet with them; correct?

A. No, sir.

Q. Is it fair to say in your first call after you had gone from October 30, 2019 to January 11, 2021, in your first call on January 11, 2021, you thanked the new DA team for continuing their investigation; didn't you?

A. Sounds correct.

Q. You told the prosecutors the very first time in January of 2021 that you had a strong desire to hold President Trump accountable; correct?

A. That sounds correct.

Q. At the time there was somebody who was working at the District Attorney's Office, who is not at this table, named Mark Pomerantz?

A. Correct.

Q. You started meeting with Mr. Pomerantz and others just after that January meeting in February of 2021; correct?

A. Sounds correct.

Q. Were those meetings —— that was during COVID, were those initial meetings on Zoom?

A. I believe one was on Zoom, yes.

Q. Do you recall that you met twice in February 2021, February 18th and February 26th, 2021?

A. Again, it sounds correct.

Q. Well, do you want to see something to refresh your recollection?

A. Sure.

MR. BLANCHE: If we can look first at B73 just for the witness the parties and the Court.

MS. HOFFINGER: Your Honor, may we approach for a minute?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, there was a sidebar discussion:

THE COURT: Yes.

MS. HOFFINGER: Mr. Blanche is now asking about another investigation, another investigation that occurred in the office related to financial conditions. If he wishes to open the door, I guess the door will be open to that. Given that it is not yet opened, I would caution that if he is asking all about those meetings, those meetings did not have to do with the case.

MR. BLANCHE: I am not asking him about the specifics of what he spoke to the District Attorney about in February. I am asking if he did meet with them.

MS. HOFFINGER: The implication is that he met with them to discuss the case.

MR. BLANCHE: If it doesn't open the door, I am happy to make it crystal clear it wasn't about this case. It was about a different investigation. I don't want to open the door.

THE COURT: You can clarify it wasn't about the case, and that won't open the door. That is fine. That will not open the door.

MR. BLANCHE: I will clean that up.

THE COURT: One person at a time. If you clarify it was not about the case, that will not open the door.

MR. BLANCHE: Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:

CONTINUED CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q. So, continuing to talk about the February 2021 timeframe. You were meeting with the District Attorney of Manhattan, but it wasn't about this case; correct?

A. Sounds correct.

Q. And you didn't —— so, you said a few minutes ago that the District Attorney hadn't asked you to come and meet with them in that timeframe; right? Meaning, between 2019 and 2021, you hadn't been asked to meet with the District Attorney; right?

A. That's correct.

Q. If they had asked, you would have cooperated and come in; correct?

A. Presumably so.

Q. And you wanted, during that time period —— and you were asked this on direct a little bit, but I want to talk about it a little bit more again. In the 2021 time period, early part, you wanted the District Attorney's Office to publicly acknowledge that you were cooperating; correct?

A. I would say so, yes.

Q. Well, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. Would you say so? Do you have any doubt that you wanted that?

A. No.

Q. And you're still serving your sentence at home; is that right?

A. I am still on supervised release.

Q. But your 2021 sentence is over?

A. November.

Q. Of 2021?

A. Of 2024.

Q. I am sorry. So, when you get home, you are still serving your sentence because of COVID. When did you go from prison to supervised release, even if it was still in your home?

A. November.

Q. Of what year?

A. 2021.

Q. So, in the beginning of 2021, we're talking about the first five months, you're still serving your sentence; correct?

A. Yes, I am still on home confinement.

Q. And the rules with home confinement meant you weren't allowed to leave your home except for certain times, for certain things; correct?

A. Yes, a certain number of hours per day that I can be outdoors.

Q. You were allowed to go places, but not anywhere you wanted; right?

A. Anywhere in Manhattan.

Q. So, what was your restrictions when you were still serving your sentence?

A. Other than those three hours, I was at home.

Q. So, three hours, seven days a week?

A. Correct.

Q. You were allowed to go anywhere in the Borough of Manhattan?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have to wear an ankle bracelet?

A. There was an ankle bracelet at first, which then became a phone.

Q. A what?

A. A telephone.

Q. So, the Bureau of Prisons tracked you on your phone, so when you were not at your home or when you went out for your three hours, that's how the Bureau of Prisons tracked you?

A. Correct.

Q. The way they knew you had your phone on you was that they would call you; right?

A. Yes.

Q. Did they randomly call you?

A. They did.

Q. So, during that time —— and, again, I don't want to get mixed up on years. Correct me if I am saying something wrong. But, during that time, the first half of 2021, you wanted the District Attorney to publicly acknowledge your cooperation; you were trying to get your sentence, even though you were just on home confinement, lowered; right?

A. I was looking for a reduction in the home confinement portion, not just from this, but also as a direct result of my work that I had done while I was at Otisville. In terms of work and program and credits, I should have been entitled to a year, but I received none of that either.

Q. Just so we understand, you're saying that you believe that there had been a calculation that was done by the Bureau of Prisons that maybe wasn't accurate, you were entitled to be released earlier; is that what you are testifying to?

A. Pursuant to the Bureau of Prisons you get what's called work credits as well as education credits, to which I took. I put in an application to the Bureau of Prisons as well, which never amounted to anything. And that would only be for the home confinement portion.

Q. But, correct me if I am wrong, one of the reasons why you wanted the District Attorney's Office to publicly announce or talk about your cooperation was to help that effort; correct?

A. I would have used that, yes.

Q. And the goal of that was to be released from prison early, even though prison was different, you weren't in Otisville, you were just at home; right?

A. I did want to be released, yes.

Q. And you talked about this on direct, but, ultimately, there was no letter or public announcement made by the District Attorney about your cooperation; correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. So, again, talking about the 2021 timeframe, you are still under the terms of imprisonment, at least until November, right, you were doing your Mea Culpa podcast from your house; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you were meeting with the District Attorney from your house, or did you also go to meet with —— did you also go down to the District Attorney's Office?

A. Possibly a combination.

Q. You were also —— you were also going on TV during that time, as we talked about an hour ago or so ago, talking about the fact that you're meeting with the District Attorney; correct?

A. Yes. But I don't believe when I was on home confinement that I was doing television. I would have to double check that.

Q. You don't remember on January —— January 17, 2021, being interviewed by MSNBC, someone named Ari Melber; you don't remember that?

A. I don't specifically remember that date, but I have been on Mr. Melber's program many times.

Q. And do you remember the next month, on February 22, 2021, going on MSNBC and being interviewed by somebody named Joy Reid?

A. Yes, I have been on Ms. Reid's program many times as well.

Q. But, just so I understand, I am talking about 2021, do you believe you were going on TV in 2021?

A. Yes.

Q. And then in November of 2021, your sentence is over and then you're on supervised release; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Can you explain what fundamentally changed when your sentence ends, given the uniqueness of the Corona Virus, when your sentence ends and you convert to supervised release?

A. With the home confinement for those appearances on television or to meet with the District Attorney's Office or anything outside of the three hours that I was provided access, you fill out a form to your probation officer, and you wait for approval. Supervised release is less stringent. Basically, you check in once a month on a form. And if you're going to leave the state or the country, you just still have to provide them with notice via an authorization form.

Q. And that the second part of what you are just talking about, that started around November of that year; right?

A. That started when I was returning home.

Q. And you're still on supervised release until November of this year; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You understood at some point during this investigative process there was a new District Attorney; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you, at times, have spoken about that District Attorney; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you have met in person with District Attorney Bragg?

A. No, sir.

Q. Then, in October 2022 —— now we have another year gone by —— you publish your second book, Revenge; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. How much money have you made from Revenge?

A. I don't know exactly, but I would say around $400,000.

Q. And knowing that in the first two months or so Disloyal made around 2 million, combining the two books, how much more did Disloyal make after the 2 million that it made in the first couple of months?

A. Maybe another million.

Q. You made —— I am not expecting you to be exact —— you made about 3.4 million dollars from those two books; is that fair?

A. Over the four—year period?

Q. Yes.

A. It is, yes, sir.

Q. So, that's over the past ——

A. I am sorry. Four years. The last four years.

Q. Yes. Thank you. So, after you publish the book Revenge —— by the way, you talk about in that book your frustration about Trump not being prosecuted; don’t you?

A. I say things like that, yes.

Q. And you say, for example, you don’t understand why nobody will hold Donald Trump responsible; right?

A. That sounds correct, yes.

Q. And you talk about in your book, about your efforts at cooperating with the Special Counsel and with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office?

A. I talk about my cooperation with them, yes.

Q. Now, in that book, you call yourself a "fixer;" right?

A. I probably referenced it, yes.

Q. But, when you think of yourself as a "fixer," are you fixing things that you broke?

A. No, sir.

Q. There came a time when you became concerned that the new District Attorney was circulating negative stories about you?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Can you repeat that?

Q. Did there come a time when you became concerned that the new District Attorney was circulating negative stories about you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you talked about that in your book; right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said that the articles were saying people familiar with Bragg's thinking were circulating stories about you?

MS. HOFFINGER: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Now, we talked a little bit earlier about that time period just over a year and three months ago, so January of 2023, that's towards the end of that month, when you turned over your phones to the District Attorney's Office; right?

A. I am sorry, I am confused by your question.

Q. We talked about earlier January 2023, so a year and three months ago, that's when you gave your phones —— consented to have the District Attorney's Office come and get your phones and take them; right?

A. Yes.

Q. You gave them your password?

A. I did.

Q. You signed a Consent Form?

A. I did.

Q. And an Investigator Rosenberg came twice, the first time and a few days later, and got both your phones?

A. Correct.

Q. It was around that time, a little before the end of January, that you started texting regularly with Investigator Rosenberg; correct?

A. No, sir, I would disagree with that characterization of "regularly."

THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, this might be a good time to stop.

MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely.

THE COURT: You are going into a new area?

MR. BLANCHE: I am.

THE COURT: Let's stop now. Jurors, I ask you, please, not to talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind.

Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return for supplying any information concerning the trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person improperly to influence you or any member of the jury.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury leaving courtroom.

THE COURT: You may be seated. Sir, you can step down.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness leaving courtroom.

THE COURT: Counsel, please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, there was an off—the—record discussion held at the bench between the Court and counsel.

THE COURT: Let's just put on the record what we were discussing at the bench. I was asking Mr. Blanche if at that point he still thought it would be possible he would be finished with the witness by Thursday afternoon. You were answering the question.

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, if I finish, it's at the end of the day, I anticipate, your Honor.

THE COURT: Again, there is no rush. Take your time. Do whatever you need to do. You are also covering a different topic?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor. As it relates to our expert witness, we put in a proposed charge today. The Government put their's in yesterday, your Honor. What we would respectfully request, that we have an opportunity to discuss the testimony to make sure that our understanding of what is admissible is consistent with the Court's motions in limine.

THE COURT: Does that sound like something we can do Thursday at 4, when we excuse the jury?

MR. BLANCHE: Absolutely.

THE COURT: Thank you. I will see you then.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the trial in this matter stood adjourned to Thursday, May 16, 2024.

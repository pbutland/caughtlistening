CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MS. NECHELES:

Q Good morning.

A Good morning.

Q We spoke a little yesterday about the travel schedule. Do you recall that —— or I’m sorry, withdrawn. We spoke a little bit yesterday about the campaign?

A Yes.

Q And you were working on the RNC Hearing; right?

A Yes.

Q What is the RNC?

A The Republican National Committee.

Q And there came a point where President Trump won the Republican nomination; right?

A Yes.

Q And after that, am I correct, that the RNC and the campaign worked extremely closely together?

A Yes.

Q Because at that point, President Trump is the presumptive Republic —— is the Republican nominee, and the RNC wants, just like the campaign wants, to get him nominated; right?

A Absolutely. Yes.

Q So you guys were basically one unit; right?

A That’s right.

Q And am I correct that everyday the RNC and the campaign would jointly create a travel schedule or document that there was a travel schedule for President Trump?

A Whenever the President—Elect was traveling, yes, uh—huh.

Q And it would —— so it included everything that he was going to be doing on that day; correct?

A Yes.

Q And I want to show you and the Prosecutors what has been marked as L —— Defendant's Exhibit L8 and L9.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.

MS. NECHELES: I apologize. I might not have set this up.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Pause.

MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, if it's okay, I will come back to it.

THE COURT: Yes, of course.

MS. NECHELES: We will come back to that.

Q So I want you to look, then, at People's Exhibit 69 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And the Prosecutor asked you about this on direct; do you recall that?

A Yes.

Q And Rhona Graff gave you this list; right?

A Yes.

Q And that was the list of contacts that Rhona Graff said that prior to the time that President Trump became President, that these were contacts he used in his business; right?

A That's right.

Q And these are people that were personal friends and also business acquaintances, you know, that he worked with; right?

A That's right.

Q And that's what Rhona Graff created for you; right?

A Yes.

Q But there were many people on that list and, to your understanding, is that these were people that President Trump spoke to a lot before he became President; right?

A Spoke to before he became President or might be interested in speaking to, to invite them to the White House or something.

Q And there were many people on that list who never called the Oval Office; right?

A Many, yes.

Q And, to the best of your knowledge, there were many people on that list that President Trump never called while he was in the Oval Office; right?

A That's correct.

Q And I want to turn to People's Exhibit 70, which is an email from you to Rhona Graff.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And that was —— you sent that to Rhona Graff; right?

A Yes.

Q And you were asking whether she could pass on a newspaper clipping; right?

A Yes.

Q And if you turn to the next page, there is that newspaper clipping; right?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A Yes.

MS. NECHELES: And if we could blow up the top part.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q It's a picture of the President the first time he boarded Air Force One; right?

A Yes.

Q Kind of an exciting thing; right?

A Yes. Exciting, yeah.

Q And he sent it to his family?

A Uh—huh.

Q Right?

A Yes.

Q Did he send that to a lot of people?

A Yeah, uh—huh.

Q He was proud?

A He was. He was proud, yeah.

Q And he would write a little note to the people on it; right?

A Uh—huh, yes.

Q And that was something that President Trump did a lot?

A Yes.

Q Sending newspaper clippings; right?

A Yes, quite often.

Q And, in fact, you probably saw him do this thousands of times; right?

A Yes.

Q He would send newspaper clippings of something that happened to people that he knew; right?

A That's right.

Q And he would write a little note on them; right?

A Yeah.

Q So, once he sent one to Allen Weisselberg; right?

A That's right.

Q Like thousands of times he sent them to other people; right?

A Yes.

Q And you were asked on many —— and so, when you were asked on direct, you were asked the question whether it was not unusual for him to have sent this newspaper clipping; do you recall that?

A Uh—huh, yes.

Q What you meant by that was, it wasn't unusual for him to send them to everybody, newspaper clippings; right?

A That's right.

Q But with respect to sending them to Allen Weisselberg, do you recall what happened other times?

A Not that I can recall, no.

Q This might have been the only time that he was President that he sent something like this to Allen Weisselberg; right?

A It could have been, yes.

Q And you were asked if Allen Weisselberg —— you spoke to Allen Weisselberg during when he was President; do you recall that, about checks?

A Yes.

Q And, am I correct, that you do not have any specific recollection of Allen Weisselberg and the President —— and President Trump speaking during the first year that President Trump was in office?

A That's correct, yes.

Q And you have a vague recollection that at some point they might have spoken about a check?

A Yes, vaguely, uh—huh.

Q But you're not even sure that that's true; right?

A No.

Q And, in fact, you really don’t recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg; right?

A No. He spoke to so many people.

Q And I want to turn back to ——

MS. NECHELES: I think we’re ready for —— to look at the L8 and L9 for the witness and the parties only.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed for the aforementioned parties only.

MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, we object to this and we ask to approach.

THE COURT: Sure.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: At Sidebar.) ~k~k~k*~k~

THE COURT: Yes? I’m happy to get to see you all so much.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Handed.

MR. STEINGLASS: We have several papers with this exhibit. I broke this again, Judge. I’m sorry. I think maybe some glue. I’m going to bring some glue.

THE COURT: Good idea.

MR. STEINGLASS: I think that there are several problems with this. First of all —— and I think that this is unlike some of the exhibits that the defense used on cross—examination because they were responsive. This is totally outside of the scope of the direct. And this is exactly the problem that we identified at the beginning of this trial, which is, that they hadn't designated any exhibits, and that your Honor had precluded any exhibits that —— directed, you know, case in chief exhibits that were not designated by the following day. They didn't designate any. So —— and we specifically raised the spectre of the defense trying to make our witnesses their own and back door that preclusion by trying to put in nonresponsive exhibits, which are really case in chief exhibits, under the guise that this is cross—examination. Now, this is fully beyond the scope of the direct examination. We didn't ask a single question about the President's travel schedule or the President—Elect's travel schedule. And to top it all off, these travel schedule exhibits are from October. She testified she wasn't even there at Trump Tower or working with the defendant until after Election Day. So, this is —— this should be precluded, this entire area.

MS. MANGOLD: I would just add to that, that she also never testified that she worked on the travel schedule. She said that she scheduled things in Trump Tower.

THE COURT: Ms. Necheles, what's the purpose of this?

MS. NECHELES: So, your Honor, we are just putting it in evidence. We are not going through them. She testified on direct about his schedule, and they have been talking about his schedule. We just are interested in what happens, actually, on one of those days, actually, October 26th. And this is a document that was created jointly by the campaign and the RNC. She was working at the RNC that day. She received these documents every day at the RNC. On those days —— she received these every day when she was working. And they were made and kept in the ordinary course of business.

THE COURT: What's the purpose of this?

MS. NECHELES: It is to show what he was doing on that one day ——

THE COURT: Why?

MS. NECHELES: —— on October 26th. Because it's an issue in this trial in terms of the People are putting in phone documents about it, about what happened, his conversations with Michael Cohen. And this explains what he was doing with Michael Cohen. It's one document, your Honor.

THE COURT: I appreciate that, but ——

MS . NECHELES: Yes .

THE COURT: Why don't you just ask her about that day?

MS. NECHELES: What's the People's objection to this document?

THE COURT: Why don't you just ask: Do you know —— do you know what Donald Trump was doing on October 26th?

MS. NECHELES: She doesn't recall.

THE COURT: She doesn't?

MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, but the business records can establish it and she can establish this as a business record.

THE COURT: She was there at the time?

MS. NECHELES: Yes, she was there at the time. She worked for the RNC.

THE COURT: Who created this?

MS. NECHELES: The RNC and the campaign jointly created it.

THE COURT: She didn't say that.

MS. NECHELES: She will. I haven't been able to ask her questions about it yet.

THE COURT: You are getting close?

MS. NECHELES: Yes, I haven't been able to ask her about this yet. We weren't able to put it up on the screen. I was about to establish a business record foundation. That's what I'm doing, what I was going to do right now.

MR. STEINGLASS: This is exactly the problem. We did not ask a single question about scheduling or the work that she did prior to the election. Ms. Necheles asked about scheduling and meetings in January. But this door is not opened. This is —— this is vintage, and an end run around your Honor's ruling, and it should not be countenanced.

MS. NECHELES: Judge, I have to say also, these documents are not like a surprise to the People. They came to us in discovery. It's not like I'm showing documents that they have never seen before.

THE COURT: But the issue is whether you intended to put them in all along.

MS. NECHELES: I actually just thought about this last night. We never intended to put it in before. I thought of this last night. I never thought of putting it in before then.

THE COURT: You need to lay a rock solid foundation. If you can even lay the foundation for this, then I will allow it. But if you are unable to, then it's not coming in.

MS. HOFFINGER: Those are ours. Thanks.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Side bar concluded.

CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MS . NECHELES:

Q Ms. Westerhout, do you recognize that document in front of you?

A I do, yes.

Q And are —— were those —— is that a travel schedule that was created by the Trump campaign and the RNC jointly?

A It appears to be, yes.

Q And were those travel schedules created every day that President Trump was traveling during the campaign?

A Yes.

Q And were they shared with the RNC and the campaign?

A I believe so, yes.

Q And you were working at the RNC at that point; am I correct?

A Yes.

Q And would you receive these travel schedules?

A I don't believe I personally received them.

Q But, would you see them?

A Probably, yes.

Q And you saw them during the course of the —— when you were working at the RNC; right?

A Yes.

Q And when you say "probably," you are not sure whether you saw these exact ones; correct?

A That's right, uh—huh.

Q But you saw the travel schedules on a regular basis; right?

A Uh—huh, yeah.

Q And you knew that they were created in the ordinary course of business of the RNC and the campaign; correct?

A Yes.

Q And you knew that they were kept in the ordinary course of business of the RNC and the campaign; right?

A That's right.

Q And it was the ordinary course of business for the RNC and the campaign jointly to create and keep these records; correct?

A Yes.

MS. NECHELES: I offer them in evidence, your Honor.

MS. MANGOLD: May I voir dire, your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MS. MANGOLD:

Q Ms. Westerhout, do you have any specific recollection of seeing these documents?

A Umm, yes.

Q These particular documents in front of you?

A Yes. My lawyer showed it to me.

Q But, in ——

A I’m sorry.

Q During —— contemporaneously with the underlying events in October of 2016, do you have an independent recollection of receiving these personally?

A No.

Q When did your lawyer have you review these? And, please, when you answer, don’t go into any discussion that you had with your lawyer.

A This morning.

MS. MANGOLD: We object.

THE COURT: Please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: At Sidebar.

THE COURT: So the People called this witness; right? I don't know how they got them this morning? How did they get them this morning?

MS. NECHELES: I sent them this morning. I called them and then I sent it this morning.

THE COURT: Because you intended to present it to the witness?

MS. NECHELES: It just happened that I thought of it last night.

MR. STEINGLASS: And we didn't even get notice of this until the witness was on the stand in the middle of questions. I mean, this is just sandbagging.

MS. NECHELES: Judge, I just sent them this morning and then maybe ten minutes before I walked in here that I was able to talk to them. She did recognize many them. She said it. This is really a very last minute thing.

THE COURT: But you were trying to lay a foundation. You already knew that she didn't see this, and you already knew her answer. And this is not even your witness.

MS. NECHELES: Your Honor, of course, I did. I, of course, I tried to present it to her.

THE COURT: This is something that the People asked for months before this trial, that you did not give notice of, what the exhibits were that you were going to use. So for two reasons I'm keeping it out: Reason number one, you should have given it to the People. You did not present it to them prior to her testifying. And, two, her answers are far from that which she can establish this as a business record. I'm not allowing it in.

MR. BOVE: Judge, may I respond on one issue? We are getting the flip side of this with exhibits that are being created and sent to us the night before. Judge, they are summarily giving us exhibits in that way ——

THE COURT: We can discuss that later.

MR. BOVE: —— so it should be reciprocal.

THE COURT: We can discuss that later.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Side bar concluded.

CONTINUED CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MS. NECHELES:

Q Okay. Thanks. So I want to ——

THE COURT: I'm sorry, your motion to introduce this into evidence is denied.

MS. NECHELES: Thank you, your Honor.

Q I want to turn your attention to the questions that you were asked about checks,

A Uh—huh.

Q All right. And you were asked a lot of questions about how checks were sent. Do you recall that?

A Yes.

Q And I want to show you what is Exhibit 66 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. NECHELES: And that can be shown to everybody.

Q So this is an email chain about how —— about addresses, about how to send stuff to the White House; right?

A Yes.

MS. NECHELES: And if we can blow up the bottom most part, the bottom entry.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. NECHELES: Thank you.

Q And there were questions being asked about how to —— oh, that was John McEntee saying, "Can you put me in touch with Rebecca because Keith is leaving and checks need to be sent to him;" right?

A Correct.

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q And that occurred at some point along the lines when you were sending —— you know, Keith Schiller was leaving the White House; right?

A Yes.

Q And I want to move a little bit back.

MS. NECHELES: And we can take that down.

Q And I want to move a little bit back to the first time when you started, when you got to the White House. And you said, yesterday, you didn't know anything when you got there; right?

A No.

Q You had been working on the transition team, but there was really no transition for you; right?

A That's right.

Q And you walked into the White House and you didn't know how President Trump would get personal items; right?

A No, I did not.

Q And you didn't know how his wife would get personal items; right?

A No.

Q And there was a lot of security about things that get sent to the White House; wasn’t there?

A Yes.

Q And that includes checking any mail or items that get received; right?

A That’s right, uh—huh.

Q So at some point you were told that there was a Post Office Box that had been set up for the President to get personal items; right?

A That’s right.

Q And that was also true for the First Lady; correct?

A Yes.

Q And then it turned out that that was a really a slow way to receive things; right?

A Yes.

Q And because of the security; correct?

A Yes, uh—huh.

Q And am I correct that it was also slow because things would get lost; right?

A Yeah, uh—huh.

Q And that some people ——sometimes you would find out that things had been sent to the White House and that President —— for President Trump personally, and he never received it; right?

A Yes, uh—huh.

Q And President Trump told you that friends of his were feeling that he was being disrespectful to them; right?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Well, he was, President Trump was upset that he was not getting personal emails or personal information —— personal documents and letters from friends of his; right?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Well, wasn't that a problem, about getting mail to President Trump through the White House?

A Yes.

Q And he, President Trump, liked to return calls promptly, you testified yesterday?

A Yes.

Q And you testified yesterday that he felt like it was disrespectful if he didn't return calls promptly; right?

A Yes.

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q And so, you all tried to figure out a way that he could get his mail promptly; right?

A That's right.

Q And the same for the First Lady, that she could get things promptly; right?

A That's right.

Q And it was the same problem for Ivanka Trump, right, that she could get personal things promptly; right?

A I don't have specific knowledge of Ms. Trump, but probably.

Q And the idea was —— had come up that things would be sent to Keith Schiller?

A Yes.

Q Right?

A Yes.

Q And that is how it came to be that Keith Schiller started to receive these checks personally; right?

A That's right, yes.

Q And when Keith Schiller —— and he received other mail that was personal for President Trump; right?

A Right.

Q And he also received things that were personal for Melania Trump; right?

A Yes.

Q Melania Trump?

A The First Lady; right.

Q Because the First Lady also had the same problem; right?

A Yes.

Q And then Keith Schiller would bring in these items and give them to you; right?

A That’s right.

Q And you would give them to President Trump; right?

A Yes.

Q And when Keith Schiller left, it was transferred to another person that the email got sent, that we just saw; right?

A Yes.

Q And then when that other person left, it became your job; right?

A That’s right.

Q And that's what this whole testimony about Fed Ex packages was about; right?

A Yes.

Q It was a way that items could be sent to you and you could get them promptly to President Trump; right?

A That's right.

Q And is it your understanding that this work—around existed in prior administrations as well?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q Well, wasn’t it a new work—around that you all came up with; was it?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MS. NECHELES: Judge, can we approach? Thank you.

Q It wasn't a new work—around that you all came up with; was it? Was it your understanding that this problem with getting items promptly to the President of the United States existed for everybody who is in that Office?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A I don't have any knowledge of what it was like in previous administrations, but I can't imagine it would have been any different.

Q Now, when you received —— you know, just focusing —— when you received whatever packages there was, you would give them to President Trump or to the First Lady; correct?

A Yes.

Q And you had nothing to do with giving documents or packages to Ms. Trump, Ivanka Trump?

A No, uh—uh.

Q And do you know how she got them?

A Ummm, I don't.

Q And you would leave whatever items came for President Trump on his desk; right?

A That's right.

Q And with respect to the checks, they came in a folder; am I correct?

A Yes.

Q And if you had —— if he had the time when you gave them to him, he would sign them?

A Yes. If he had the time and if he was in the office, yes.

Q And you said he signed a tremendous amount of items; right?

A Yes.

Q And there were proclamations that he was signing?

A Yes, commissions, proclamations, executive orders, memos, letters.

Q And that would take up many hours of his day; right?

A Yes.

Q Because he didn't not like to have that in printed form; right?

A No.

Q He felt that if someone was getting his signature, they deserved his real signature; right?

A Yes, absolutely.

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MS. MANGOLD: Move to strike.

Q And ——

MS. MANGOLD: Move to strike.

THE COURT: Stricken from the record.

Q And, were there times, you know, with all these —— would you say it was hundreds of documents that he was signing?

A Not every day. But sometimes, uh—huh.

Q And this was in between other things that he was doing; right?

A Oh, yes, uh—huh.

Q And so, would you see him signing things without reviewing them?

A Yes.

Q And would you see him signing checks without reviewing them?

A Yes.

Q And you would see him signing checks while he was on the phone; right?

A Yes.

Q Would you see him sometimes signing checks when he was meeting with people?

A Yes.

Q And there were different types of people that he was meeting with; right?

A Yes.

Q Sometimes he was meeting with the top foreign leaders in the world; right?

A Yes, uh—huh.

Q And other times he was meeting with you?

A Yeah, uh—huh.

Q And so, he wouldn't be signing the checks when he was meeting with the top people in the world?

A Yes.

Q But maybe when he was meeting with you, talking about something else, he would also be signing documents?

A Yes, talking about the schedule or anything that had been going on.

Q The Chief of Staff that he would be meeting with?

A Yes.

Q And other people, he would be doing that?

A That's right.

Q He was a person who multitasked; right?

A Definitely.

Q And now, I want to ask you about some other items that we are showing.

MS. NECHELES: If we could show Exhibit 71. And that's in evidence. People's Exhibit 71. We can show it to everybody.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q And Madeleine Westerhout sent you this, right —— oh, you sent this to her and it says: "Rhona, can you help me with this?" Right?

A Yes.

Q And if we can turn to the next page. It's an invoice; right?

A Yes.

Q And this is a personal expense of President Trump; right?

A Right.

Q And it was sent to you, and with the question from Rhona; right?

A Yes.

Q And she wanted to know what to do with this; right?

A Right.

Q And in your experience, Rhona Graff was very careful about not wanting to spend the President’s money without his approval; right?

A Yes. Uh—huh.

Q And so she wanted to check with him; right?

A Yes.

Q It’s his money; right?

A Yes.

Q And so, she would send you this kind of thing and ask him?

A Uh—huh, yes.

Q And he answered it with one word; right?

A Right.

Q Just "pay;" right?

A Right.

Q Boom! It was off his desk; right?

A Right.

Q Because he was extremely busy; right?

A Yes.

Q And I want to turn your attention now to another exhibit.

MS. NECHELES: I’m sorry, I just don't know the exhibit number.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Pause.

MS . NECHELES: People’ 5 Exhibit 75 .

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Yes. And do you recall being shown this on direct, this is a series of emails about President Trump’s —— about a frame that President Trump wanted?

A Yes.

Q And, again, Rhona Graff was asking questions about the price of the frame; right?

A Right.

Q And just to be clear, this was —— President Trump was putting in the credenza, in back of where he sat, a number of photographs; right?

A Yes.

Q And they were photographs of people who were important to him; right?

A Yes, his family.

Q He had a photograph of his father?

A Uh—huh.

Q He had a photograph of his wife and children; is that correct?

A Yes, uh—huh.

Q And he wanted a photograph of his mother?

A Yeah.

Q And so he wanted a nice frame?

A That's right.

Q And those frames —— those photographs, when he would be sitting at the Resolute Desk, they would be right behind him; right?

A That's right.

Q And often pictures that were taken would show the photographs behind him; right?

A That's right, uh—huh.

Q And so, he was looking for a very nice frame; right?

A Yes.

Q But Rhona Graff, again, was not comfortable spending the President's money; right?

A To my understanding, yes.

Q And so you said on direct you made an executive decision to just okay this; right?

A Yes. I don't remember specifically, but that could have very well been the case.

Q Because when President Trump was in the White House, you understood he was too busy to be dealing with this kind of thing; right?

A Yes.

Q His life may have been different before when he was just running a major company in the United States, but it was different when he was running the United States; right?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A That's right.

Q Now, you were asked some questions about —— or —— you were in the White House, am I correct, when there came —— there was a story about Stormy Daniels; right?

A That's right.

Q And you were working with President Trump, very closely with him at that point; right?

A Yes.

Q And did there come a time when there was a story about Stormy Daniels in the paper?

A Yes.

Q And did you have a conversation with President Trump about that?

A Yes, I did.

Q And based on that conversation, what was your understanding of his feelings about this story?

A That he was very upset by it.

Q And why?

A Ummm, my understanding is that he knew it would be hurtful to his family.

Q And that was based on what he said to you; was that your understanding?

A Ummm, I don’t believe he specifically said that, but I could just tell that the whole situation was very unpleasant.

MS. MANGOLD: Objection. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Sustained. The answer is stricken.

Q Well, when you say he didn’t specifically say that, he spoke about his family?

A Meaning, he didn’t specifically speak about his family in that conversation.

Q Okay.

MS. NECHELES: If I may have a moment.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Defense counsel confer.

MS. NECHELES: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Any redirect?

MS. MANGOLD: Yes, your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. MANGOLD:

A Yes.

Q Was the method of sending checks through Fed Ex to somebody's personal address an end run around the White House security protocols?

A Yes.

Q How do you know?

A It has my initials and the date.

Q And does that thumb drive contain a set of AT&T records that have been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 400?

A Yes.

Q Are the records contained in People's 400 for identification call detail and subscriber records?

A Yes.

Q How many different phone numbers do they relate to?

A Six numbers that belong to AT&T and eleven numbers that were just on our network for roaming or was in contact with an AT&T number.

Q Okay. So there are records —— tell me if I get this right. There are records for 17 different phone numbers?

A Yes.

Q Of which six belong to customers of AT&T?

A Yes.

Q And the other eleven are just call records that AT&T captured because it used the AT&T system?

A Correct.

Q Were those records for the non—AT&T customer records, do those call detail records only reflect calls that were transmitted through AT&T cell towers or calls made to or received from an AT&T customer?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: So marked in evidence.

MR. CONROY: And just, just for the record, this is subject to the Sealing Order that was dated April 19th.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. CONROY: Now, if we could pull up three pages from this exhibit that have been redacted. And beginning with page —— with Bates stamp DANY GJ and then 60 and the number 38.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this?

A Yes.

Q What is this?

A A subscriber report.

Q Is this a representative sample of an AT&T subscriber record?

A Yes.

Q Do the pages you are viewing on the screen contain redactions?

A Yes.

Q Did you have a chance to compare the redacted pages that we see here to the original pages that are not redacted, but that are in evidence as People’s 400?

A Yes.

Q Were the redacted and unredacted pages the same, but for the redactions?

A Yes.

Q I just want to ask you about a few of the boxes in here. What does "financially liable party" mean?

A It’s the person responsible for paying the bill.

Q What is the billing party?

A The billing party is where the bill is mailed to.

MR. CONROY: And if we could pull up the user information.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A That's the registered user for the account.

Q So is it —— could it be different —— could the billing party be different from the user information?

A Yes.

Q Why is that?

A Because the person who pays the bill is not necessarily the one using the phone number.

Q Is that something you might often see in a situation where a business gives phones to employees?

A Yes.

Q So the business might be the billing party, but the individual employee who uses the phone might be in the user information?

A Yes.

Q What is the MSISDN?

A That's the phone number on the account.

Q And what does "MSISDN Active" mean?

A The date it was active.

Q So, it's sort of a date range?

A Yes, a date range.

MR. CONROY: If we could take that down. And if we could —— I want to pull up now an example of call detail records.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do the call detail records within People's Exhibit 400 contain three different types of reports?

A Yes.

Q What are those three reports?

A Mobility, wireline, and international.

Q Starting with mobility. What is a mobility report?

A Mobility is the communication between a mobile and —— any mobile device and a mobile device, two mobile devices.

Q So a phone call from a cell phone to a cell phone?

A Yes.

Q What is "International"?

A That’s when the international network was used to make or help receive a phone call.

Q And what is wireline?

A Wireline is the use of AT&T’s wireline—side of the network to help make or receive a phone call.

Q Is that sometimes called hardline?

A I'm sorry?

Q Is that sometimes called hardline? Or is that ——

A Yes. Landline.

Q Landline, sorry. That’s what I meant, landline. Is the mobility report further subdivided into different categories of data?

A Yes.

Q And do those include invoice usage, data usage, SMS usage and SMS email usage?

A Yes.

Q Can you briefly describe what invoice usage means?

A Invoice usage shows the transactional logs between phone calls.

Q What does SMS usage mean?

A That also shows the transactional logs between text messages.

Q Does —— would that include text messages made through encrypted apps?

A No.

Q Do they include iMessages?

A No.

Q Generally speaking, for the two iPhone users that are messaging one another, would you expect to see those transactions in the call detail records?

A It would be a transaction that’s captured in a data session.

Q In a data session?

A A data session, yes.

Q And when you —— what does that mean? Can you explain what that means?

A So, on our data records, we show logs of different sessions. Just a length of the session, we are unable to determine what took place during those sessions.

Q Okay. And, actually, the next thing we are going to talk about is, what does data usage mean. What are some of the types of activity that would be captured in a data usage report?

A Streaming movies. Anything related to the internet.

Q And when you look at a data usage report, do you just see amounts of data that was used, or do you see what that data was used to do?

A Only amounts of data being used.

Q So, you have no way of understanding, you just know X amount of data was used, but you don’t know if somebody was streaming a movie or iMessaging or something else?

A Correct.

Q Can you briefly tell us what SMS email usage means?

A SMS email is just basically a text to or from an email address.

Q For all of the different types of call detail records you just described, what time zone are AT&T’s records recorded in?

A UTC.

Q And what is UTC?

A Universal Time Coordinated.

Q And is that true for all types of AT&T records?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: If we could now pull up another redacted page from this exhibit. And this page bears Bates stamp DANY GJ 00002822.

Q Mr. Dixon, is this a representative sample of an AT&T invoice usage record?

A Yes.

Q And I just want to ask you about a few of the columns. What does "CONN" stand for?

A Connection.

Q And what is Seizure Time?

A "Seizure Time" is the moment a person hits call up until the recipient answers the phone.

Q And are both Connection and Seizure Time in UTC, as we just discussed?

A Yes. The connection times is a timestamp.

Q What is "ET?"

A "ET" is the length of the connection.

Q And does "ET" stand for elapsed time?

A Elapsed time.

Q And is that in minutes and seconds?

A Yes.

Q What does originating number and terminating number mean?

A That means, originating is who made the call. Terminating is who received the call.

Q Is one single phone call sometimes reflected on more than one row in the call detail records?

A Yes.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, at this time, Principal Court Reporter Susan Pearce—Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky as the official court reporter.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Continued from the previous page.

Q Could you briefly explain why that is?

A So, these reports are used for network and billing purposes. They show the raw records, how that call flows through the network.

Q So, if it had more than one entry, would that just mean it hit different parts of the network while the call was going on?

A Correct.

MR. CONROY: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Your witness.

MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.

THE COURT: You may inquire.

MR. BOVE: Thank you.

CROSS—EXAMINATION 6 BY MR . BOVE:

Q Good morning, Mr. Dixon. My names is Emil Bove and I represent President Trump, who is over here to the left. I just want to talk in a little bit more detail about some of the records we just covered to make sure I understand them.

A Okay.

Q I would like to start with the subscriber record.

MR. BOVE: And, Mr. Bernik, if we can bring up the same page that the Government had up from Government’s Exhibit 400 with Bates ending 038. Can we ask the Government to bring up that page? If you can zoom in, please, on the box that has the MSISDN. Thank you.

Q So, Mr. Dixon, in the top left, that is MSISDN, which is the phone number you said?

A Yes.

Q To the right of that cell it says, IMSI. Do you see that?

A Yes.

Q And that stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, right?

A Yes.

Q And the IMSI is linked to an AT&T's user account, right?

A Well, it’s the serial number of a SIM card.

Q Right. So, it is a SIM card that is linked to the AT&T account that we are looking at?

A At that time, yes.

Q And a SIM card can be pulled out of one phone, one device, and put into another, correct?

A Yes.

Q And so, this IMSI is not necessarily linked to a particular physical device, right?

A Correct. It can be taken out. It’s just the serial number of a SIM card.

MR. BOVE: If we can zoom in on status changes there at the bottom, please.

Q Mr. Dixon, I wanted to ask about the cells that read XMKT Move . Do you see that?

A Yes.

Q And that means that that is a cross market move, right?

A I believe so.

Q That is a situation where the user’s account transitions from one account number to another within AT&T’s records, right?

A Usually, yes.

Q So, here this record indicates that on January 23, 2017, this was a cross market move associated with this Michael Cohen account?

A Yes.

Q And so, for the record that we are looking at, this user account, the subscriber information begins January 23, 2017?

A Can you repeat that?

Q Because of the cross market move field that we are looking at, what that suggests is that the subscriber information we are looking at begins on that period?

A We would have to look in the other boxes because this is —— the status change history only shows changes of the account. So, it could have been created before and something took place on January 23, 2017.

Q Right. The account could have been created before and then the phone number transitioned onto this account by a cross market move?

A Possibly.

Q Do you want to look at a different piece of this page to try to figure that out?

A Could you zoom back out? So, it was —— it would seem as if on January 23rd, the number left this account.

MR. BOVE: And if we can zoom back in on that box, please. Thank you.

Q Do you see that the top two rows, contract accepted and contract acceptance required?

A Yes.

Q What does that indicate?

A I am not familiar with it.

MR. BOVE: Now, we can take that down. Thank you.

Q I want to talk a little bit about the AT&T billing records. And those are, basically, records of calls involving this phone number over AT&T’s network, right?

A Yes.

Q And you can’t tell from the records themselves who actually spoke, right?

A Correct.

Q And, obviously, these records don’t reflect the contents of the calls, right?

A Correct.

Q And you are familiar with the concept of a pocket dial, right?

A Correct.

Q So, it’s possible that that could happen, somebody picks up the phone, the phone gets picked up on the other end but there is no communication, right?

A Yes.

Q In these records, there is a lot of data here, but the data also has limits, right?

A It’s showing the transactional logs.

Q Transactional logs meaning the amount of time that the one phone number was connected to the other, right?

A Yes.

Q And also that period of time where the one phone number was dialing the other?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: And if we can bring up the redacted mobility logs that we were looking at. Thank you.

Q You see on the right side there is a column, IMEI on there?

A Yes.

Q That’s International Mobile Equipment Identity, right?

A Yes.

Q And that is, actually, a number that is linked to a physical device, right?

A Yes.

Q So that IMSI, travels with a SIM card you pulled out from another phone, right?

A Yes.

Q But on this record, where is says IMEI on it, that is a specific reference to a particular phone, correct?

A A device, yes.

MR. BOVE: There is one unredacted page that I would like to show just the witness, Judge, if that is all right.

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. BOVE: So, Mr. Bernik, this is for the parties, the Court and the witness, part of Government Exhibit 400 that ends with Bates 1093, please.

Q And I just want to make sure that I understand the Feature column, and so, we are going to go through a couple of these, and I am going over to the table so I can see as well.

MR. BOVE: And so, let’s —— if we could zoom in on the Feature column for item seven and eight on this page.

Q And, Mr. Dixon, while we are doing that, are you familiar with the codes in the Feature column?

A Yes.

Q And so, do you see where it says, NIOP?

A Yes.

Q And that’s Call Number Identity Presentation, right?

A Yes.

Q Basically an incoming call?

A Correct.

Q And then do you see where it says, CFNA?

A Yes.

Q Calling Number Identity Presentation, right?

A No. CFNA is Call Forwarding No Answer.

Q And then the next one is VM, Voice—mail?

A Yes.

Q So, am I understanding this right, that when I see something like this in the Feature column, what I am looking at is a call that is dialed and then it goes to voicemail, right?

A Yes.

Q And in the AT&T records, each account has a separate phone number for voicemail, right?

A Not each account, but each voicemail magistrate. So, there is another number entailed with voicemail.

Q Was it voicemail magistrate that you said?

A Voicemail box.

Q And so, that an incoming call to the number associated with this account, again, gets forwarded to that voice—mail inbox, right?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: Now, if we can stay on these two rows, items seven and eight, and if you can zoom in on Originating Number and Terminating Number.

Q And so, you see here there is a D in parentheses?

A Yes.

Q That stands for dialed, right?

A Yes.

Q And so, there is an originating number that dialed that 0114 number, right?

A Yes.

Q And then where you see the F in parentheses ——

A Yes.

Q —— that is the number getting forwarded to the voicemail inbox, correct?

A Yes.

Q And that’s what the F means?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: I have nothing further, Judge.

THE COURT: Any redirect?

MR. CONROY: I have nothing, Judge. Thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you, sir. You can step down.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness is excused.

THE COURT: Would you like to call your next witness?

MR. CONROY: Yes, Judge. At this time the People call Jennie Tomalin.

COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness entered the courtroom.

COURT OFFICER: Good morning. Step up. Remain standing, please. Raise your right hand and face the Clerk.

Q Good morning, Ms. Tomalin. Are you employed?

A Yes, I am.

Q Where do you work?

A Verizon.

Q What kind of company is Verizon?

A We are a telecommunications company.

Q What is your job title?

A I am a Senior Analyst in Executive Relations.

Q How long have you been in that role?

A Since 2017; so, seven years.

Q And what are your duties and responsibilities in that role?

A My duties include appearing in court as a custodian of records to testify to records previously produced in response to subpoenas, court orders and search warrants.

Q What did you do at Verizon before you were in that role?

A I was a Subpoena Compliance Coordinator of the Verizon Security Assistance Team.

Q How long have you been at Verizon?

A Eighteen years.

Q And in your time at Verizon, have you become familiar with Verizon’s recordkeeping practices?

A Yes, I have.

Q And you understand that you are here today testifying as a custodian of records for Verizon?

A Yes, I do.

Q And are you here because Verizon received a subpoena asking for custodian testimony?

A Yes, I am.

Q Relating, specifically, to its phone business, does Verizon keep subscriber and call records?

A Yes, we do.

Q Generally, what are call records?

A Call records for the wireless side are billable incoming and outgoing calls. On the wired—line side, call records will be tolls or billable outbound calls.

Q And what are subscriber records?

A Records that contain the financial responsible party for the line of service or account, including any contact information, address, et cetera.

Q Does Verizon make and keep subscriber and call records in the regular course of its business?

A Yes, we do.

Q And is it the regular course of Verizon’s business to make and keep such records?

A Yes, it is.

MR. CONROY: I am going to ask that the witness be handed a thumb drive. Thank you.

Q Ms. Tomalin, if you take a look at that thumb drive, does that thumb drive contain a set of Verizon records that have been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 401?

A Yes, it does.

Q And before coming to court today, did you have a chance to review the records on that thumb drive?

A I did.

Q And is that the thumb drive you reviewed?

A Yes, it is.

Q How do you know that?

A Because I initialed and dated the thumb drive.

Q Are the records contained in People’s 401 for identification on that thumb drive call and subscriber records?

A Yes, they are.

Q How many different phone numbers do they relate to?

A Twelve.

Q Do those phone numbers all belong to Verizon customers?

A Yes.

Q Do all of the phone records, both subscriber and call records, relate to the general time period of 2015 to 2018?

A Yes.

Q Did Verizon make and keep the subscriber and call records contained in People’s Exhibit 401 for identification in the regular course of its business?

A Yes.

Q Was it the regular course of Verizon’s business to make and keep these particular records?

A Yes.

Q Are the entries made on these documents made at the time of the recorded events or transactions took place or written a reasonable time thereafter?

A Yes.

Q Is the date contained in these reports captured —— I am sorry. Is the data contained in these reports captured through an automated process and stored in the electronic database?

A Yes.

Q Does Verizon rely on the accuracy of that automated process and electronic database?

A Yes.

Q Can Verizon employees run reports that capture data from the electronic database?

A Yes.

Q Are they under a business duty to do so accurately?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: At this point I am going to offer People’s Exhibit 401 into evidence.

MR. BOVE: No objection.

THE COURT: It’s accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People’s Exhibit 401 is received into evidence.

MR. CONROY: If we can now pull up —— I think I am running a little behind here. If we can pull up a redacted page from one of the call records.

Q Displayed in front of you and for the room is a redacted page from People's 401 which bears the Bates stamp DANY GJ, triple 0, 64777. Is this a representative sample of a call record for a Verizon phone number?

A Yes, it is.

Q Does this page that we are looking at contain redactions?

A Yes, it does.

Q Did you have a chance to compare this redacted page to the original page that is part of what's in evidence as People’s 401?

A Yes, I did.

Q But for the redactions, are the pages identical?

A Yes.

Q Could you just walk us through the columns on this page and explain what each one is?

A Yes. Starting on the left, the Date column identifies the date that the call began. The Time column identifies the time the call began. The Number column will identify the telephone number that the target telephone number was communicating with. The Rate and Usage Type columns identify what portion of a customer's calling plan will be applied to these calls. The Origination column identifies the geographical area for which we are billing the target telephone number while making or receiving the telephone call. The Destination Call Logs for FM calls, identified by the home area of the telephone number being called. For Incoming Calls it will reflect incoming CL or any other code that is needed with that call. The Min column, identifies the length of the call in minutes. Air Time Charges, Long Distance/Other Charges and Total, those three columns identify any financial charges assessed to that call respectively.

Q Just a couple of quick questions. In the MIN column, is that minutes?

A Yes, it is.

Q And how does that work? Does it reflect seconds, or does Verizon round in a standard direction?

A On the bill we round up.

Q And with respect to the time shown for each of those calls, what timezone does Verizon keep its records in?

A They —— the timezone should be the timezone for the City and State reflected in the origination column.

Q So, when we look at the date and time columns, together with the origination column, that should tell us the timezone that that call is being reflected in?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: Thank you. I have no further questions.

THE COURT: You may inquire.

MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.

CROSS—EXAMINATION 4 BY MR . BOVE:

Q Good morning, Ms. Tomalin.

A Good morning.

Q My name is Emil Bove and I represent President Trump, who is over here on my left. I want to talk a little lit about the subscriber records that are part of Exhibit 401 if we could.

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: Because they are not redacted, I am just going to ask ——

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. BOVE: So, Mr. Bernik, this is just for the Court, the parties and the witness.

Q Take a look at the spreadsheet with Bates ending 64591. And Ms. Tomalin, do you see that in Column D it says, MTN?

A Yes.

Q That’s Mobile Telephone Number in Verizon records, right?

A Yes.

Q The phone number linked to the account, correct?

A Yes.

Q And so, if you look at cell D3, Column D, row three, that row relates to telephone number ending 5361?

A Yes.

Q And if you look, staying on that row, at Columns F and G, the subscriber name is Keith Davidson linked to this number?

A Yes.

Q So that when you say, subscriber name, that's information that somebody provided to Verizon saying that I am a person who is linked to this account, right?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: And Mr. Bernik, if we could scroll over to Column AA, please.

Q Do you see where it says, MTN Effective Date?

A Yes.

Q So, that's a Mobile Telephone Number Effective Date, right?

A Correct.

Q That indicates the date on which this phone number was linked to the account, right?

A That's right.

Q So, for this row, what does it say for this row? I am sorry. I can’t see.

A That was row three, correct?

Q Yes. Thank you.

A April 30, 2010.

Q So, for this record, as of April 30, 2010, going forward, this number was linked to the particular account that’s reflected in this subscriber information, right?

A Correct.

Q And for purposes of this record, prior to April of 2010, this record doesn’t have anything to say about that, correct?

A Correct.

Q And phone numbers can shift from account to account and person to person, right?

A Yes.

Q And so, you know, it's entirely possible that pre—April 2010, this number belonged to somebody else, right?

A Yes.

Q I just —— I have one question about the toll records that we looked at in Government Exhibit 401. Those sorts of looked like the phone bills that I might get for my cellphone, right?

A Yes.

Q And you said Verizon rounds up on the Duration field?

A Yes.

Q So, if there was a call that lasted 15 seconds, does that bump up to one minute?

A Yes.

Q And if a call lasted one second, it bumps up to one minute also?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. CONROY: No, Judge.

THE COURT: Thank you. You may step down.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness is excused.

THE COURT: All right, jurors. Let’s take our morning recess. Please remember my admonitions. See you in a few minutes.

COURT OFFICER: All rise.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jury exited the courtroom.

THE COURT: You may be seated. People, is there anything you want to discuss at this time?

MR. STEINGLASS: No. We have to modify the exhibit as we discussed before.

THE COURT: I believe there was also an objection from the Defense.

MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: Is this a good time to take up the objection?

MR. BOVE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: Let’s do that.

MR. BOVE: So, Government Exhibit 411, it would be 411—B is the proffered exhibit, is an excerpt of —— an excerpt of an —— excuse me, excerpt of an interview of President Trump by Larry King in 1999. And, in substance, there is a question, what are your views on campaign finance reform? And part of what President Trump said in response to that in 1999 is that he is very experienced with the campaign finance laws, and I think the clip is limited to just about that. Our position is that that is not relevant with respect to President Trump’s state of mind in 2016 and 2017 because there has been extensive revisions to the campaign finance laws in the intervening period, both statutory and in the Supreme Court. Whatever President Trump may have said in 1999 about his knowledge of the campaign finance laws is not probative of his state of mind in 2016 and 2017.

MS. MANGOLD: Your Honor, we disagree. We think that Defendant’s admission that he has extensive knowledge of campaign finance laws is obviously directly relevant to the case. We understand that there were, as Mr. Bove noted, extensive changes to campaign finance laws in 2002. We believe that’s a reference to the McCain/Feingold Act. However, the separate contribution ban, which is the one that’s relevant here, has been part of campaign finance laws since 1907, so close to 90 years before Mr. Trump made the admission in that video. And to the extent that defense counsel argues that the clip predates the relevant time period, that’s an issue that goes to weight and not admissibility.

THE COURT: Do you have any other argument?

MR. BOVE: No. That’s our position, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. I will rule after the break.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Short recess is taken.

SERGEANT: Remain seated. Come to Order. Part 59 is back in session.

THE COURT: All right. Two things regarding the People’s application, I understand what you are saying, that the laws did not change between 1999 and 2017. I still feel that that’s pretty attenuated. Plus, you are asking the jurors to draw an inference that because he knew the laws in 1999, he still knew them in 2015 and 2017. I think that's a lot of speculation. I am going to side with the Defense and preclude you from introducing that. Regarding scheduling today, we have two more witnesses, right, today?

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes.

THE COURT: And how long do you expect the witnesses to be?

MS. MANGOLD: I think we probably have an hour in total.

THE COURT: In total?

MS. MANGOLD: In total.

THE COURT: So, are we okay working until one o’clock, or maybe a little bit longer than one o’clock, so we will end in the morning and not come back in the afternoon?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

MS. MANGOLD: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: Your Honor, I have a legal matter about an exhibit that we can take up after the witnesses are done. I don’t think it will take long.

THE COURT: Let’s get the jury, please.

SERGEANT: All rise, jury entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jury entered the courtroom.

THE COURT: You may be seated.

THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. All jurors are present and properly seated.

THE COURT: Jurors, before we call the next witness, I wanted to talk about the schedule for the rest of the day. I am told that we only have two more witnesses that are relatively short. Today's plan is we are going to work until about one o'clock or whatever time we get done so you don’t have to come back in the afternoon. Let’s call the next witness, please.

MS. MANGOLD: The People recall Georgia Longstreet.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness resumed the stand.

THE COURT: Ms. Longstreet, you are still under oath. You may inquire.

MS. MANGOLD: Thank you, your Honor. GEORGIA LONGSTREET, called as a witness, being previously sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:

A Yep.

Q Are you the only paralegal who works on this matter?

A I am not.

Q Who else works on the matter with you in the paralegal capacity?

A There are two other paralegals, Nishant Bhaumik and Jaden Jarmel—Schneider.

Q In addition to your own work, are you familiar with the work done by the other paralegals on the case?

A Yes.

Q How are you familiar with that?

A I like to think we all work as one. We all kind of do the same things.

Q And do you know what work they do in addition to your own?

A Yep.

Q As part of your role on the matter involving Donald Trump, are you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel—Schneider responsible for reviewing materials produced to the DA's Office in response to subpoenas?

A Yes.

Q And does that include analyzing records of communications like text messages and phone calls?

A Yes.

A Yes.

Q And is the data provided in different timezones?

A Yes.

Q And are you, as part of your job, required to convert timezones in order to analyze the data?

A Yes.

Q In total, approximately, how many pages of text messages have you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel—Schneider reviewed in connection with the case?

A Pages, I would say, maybe like 2500.

Q How many have you personally reviewed?

A Probably around a hundred.

Q Approximately, how many pages of call records have you, Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel—Schneider reviewed in connection with the case?

A Over 10,000 pages.

A Probably around 300 to 500 pages.

A One hundred to 200.

A About 50.

Q Did you and Mr. Bhaumik and Mr. Jarmel—Schneider also review and save public court filings that could be relevant to the case?

A Yes.

Q Approximately, how many legal proceedings did you and the other paralegals review and save items from?

A Approximately, 75 different cases.

A About 500.

Q Through your work on the case, are you familiar with an important —— I am sorry —— dates of important court filings?

A Yes.

Q Before testifying today, did you have an opportunity to review files marked for identification as People’s Exhibits 407—F, 407—G, 407—H and 407—I?

A Yes.

Q Are they public posts from the Twitter handle @realDonaldTrump.

A Yes.

Q Who retrieved and saved those posts?

A I did.

Q Did you save them in a particular way?

A I did.

Q And did you save them in the same way that you saved the previous Twitter posts that we discussed last time?

A Yes.

Q Can you briefly remind the jury what that was?

A Yes. So, I just used the platform or the tool that we have to screenshot, and I then screenshot the post, save it to a folder that was relevant to the post and then hashed the post.

Q And hashing, again, is a way to uniquely identify each post?

A Yeah.

Q Are these exhibits exact copies of the public posts that you saved and hashed?

A Yes.

MS. MANGOLD: The People now offer into evidence Exhibits 407—F, G, H and I.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, the same objection as discussed last week.

THE COURT: Your objection is noted and overruled. People’s Exhibits 407—F, G, H and I are accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibits 407—F, G, H and I were received into evidence.

MS. MANGOLD: All right. Can you please display what's now in evidence as People's Exhibit 407—F? BY MS. MANGOLD:

Q Ms. Longstreet, is this a Twitter post?

A Yes.

Q And I think last time you explained some aspects of the social media platform Twitter and how it operated in 2016?

A Yep.

Q In addition to those questions, can you explain what a thread is?

A Yes. So, Twitter has a character limit which only allows you to put a certain amount of characters for one tweet. So, a way that some users are able to get around the character limit is by posting multiple tweets in the same thread so they are kind of connected to each other in a sense.

Q And is this an example of a thread?

A Yes.

Q Is the first post —— I am sorry —— is the top post shown here the first one in time?

A Yep.

Q Were all of these posts made the same day?

A Yes.

Q What Twitter handle was used to make these posts?

A @realDonaldTrump.

Q What’s the date and time shown for the top post?

A April 21st, 2018 at 9:10 am.

Q Can you please focus on just the top post? Can you read the top post to the jury?

A Yes. The New York Times and a third—rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie, who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip. They use —— dot, dot, dot.

MS. MANGOLD: Can you pull up the bottom two posts, please?

Q Can you read those?

A Non—existent sources and a drunk slash drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family, Michael is a businessman for his own account slash lawyer who I always liked and respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media.

Q What’s the date for all three of the posts?

A April 21, 2018.

MS. MANGOLD: You can take that down.

Q Did the court filings that you reviewed include a Federal criminal case for Michael Cohen?

A Yes.

Q Was one of the court filings the paralegal team saved for that case a guilty plea?

A Yes.

Q Do you know the date of that guilty plea?

A I believe it was August 21, 2018.

MS. MANGOLD: Now, can we please display what is in evidence as People’s Exhibit 407—H?

Q Can you see that, Ms. Longstreet?

A Yes.

Q Is this another Twitter post?

A Yes.

Q What Twitter handle was used to make this post?

A @realDonaldTrump.

Q And what is the date and time for this post?

A It ends August 22, 2018 at 8:44 a.m.?

Q Can you please read this to the jury?

A If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen.

Q And is there an explanation point end of that post?

A Yes. Sorry.

MS. MANGOLD: And can we take this down and display what’s in evidence as People’s Exhibit 407—I.

Q Is this another Twitter post that you pulled and saved?

A Yes.

Q What is the Twitter handle used to make this post?

A @realDonaldTrump.

Q What is the date and time shown for this post?

A August 22, 2018, at 9:21 a.m.

Q And is that the same day as the last post we just saw?

A Yes.

Q How long after the post we just saw was this one posted?

A I would have to see the timestamp.

Q It’s fine. But it was posted the same day?

A Yes.

Q Can you read this post to the jury?

A Yes. I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. Justice took a 12—year—old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break, make up stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a great man. Explanation point.

MS. MANGOLD: All right. We can take that down. Now, finally, can we display what’s in evidence as People's Exhibit 407—G, please? Can you flip through the pages of this Exhibit quickly?

Q Ms. Longstreet, is this another Twitter post that you saved?

A Yes.

Q Is this another example of a thread?

A Yes.

Q And how many parts does this thread have?

A Three.

Q What was the Twitter handle used to make these posts?

A @realDonaldTrump.

Q And what is the date and time shown for the top post?

A May 3rd, 2018 at 6:46 a.m.

Q And can you please read the post for the jury?

A Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties, known as a Non—Disclosure Agreement or NDA. These agreements are —— dot, dot, dot.

MS. MANGOLD: Then move to the second post to the thread.

A Very common amongst celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford, Daniels. The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair ——

Q And is this now the final post in the thread?

A Yes. Despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair, prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money for the campaign or campaign contributions played no role in this transaction.

MS. MANGOLD: Thank you. Can we take that down, please? Now, can we show everyone what's already in evidence as People’s Exhibit, 171 A?

Q Ms. Longstreet, do you recognize this?

A Yes.

Q And how do you recognize it?

A This was something that the paralegal team had to analyze in response to subpoena compliance.

Q So this was produced —— this is a document that was produced to the DA’s Office pursuant to a subpoena?

A Yes.

Q And you and the paralegal team analyzed the document after it was received?

A Yes.

Q Do you ——

MS. MANGOLD: Can you please blow up the two middle columns?

Q And do you see contact information in those middle columns?

A Yes.

Q Based on your work on the case, can you identify the individuals associated with the contact information provided there?

A Yes.

Q So, looking first on the left, there is something redacted, and then it says, @dylanhoward.com. Is that an email address?

A Yes.

Q Do you know who that email address is associated with?

A Yes.

Q Who is it?

A Dylan Howard.

Q And do you see just below that there is an email address that ends, @wideeyecommunications.com?

A Yes.

Q Based upon on your work on the case, can you identify the individual associated with that email address?

A Yes.

Q Who is it?

A Dylan Howard.

Q Looking now to the other column, do you see where it just has the letter G?

A Yes.

Q And there are the last four digits of the phone number shown there?

A Yeah.

Q Based on your work on the case, can you identify the individual associated with that phone number?

A Yeah.

Q Who is it?

A Gina Rodriguez.

CROSS EXAMINATION 7 BY MR . BLANCHE:

Q. Good morning again, Ms. Longstreet. How are you?

A. Good. How are you?

Q. We spoke last Friday; correct?

A. We did.

Q. So I am not going to re—ask all the questions that I asked last Friday about the work that you did. The first was talking about the tweets and the Truth’s that you reviewed. I believe you testified last week, but correct me if I am wrong, that you reviewed thousands of tweets and Truths as part of your work on this case?

A. I did.

Q. And the tweets that we saw today, again, you didn't select which ones to put up out of the thousands that you reviewed, for example; the table here and to my right selected them; right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And since you testified last Friday, have you been tasked with doing any additional social media reviews of anybody involved in this case?

A. Like additional review that wasn't already being done before?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. So you're still not reviewing Mr. Cohen's TikTok?

A. Not currently, no.

Q. You're not aware of something that he TikTok'd two nights ago, for example, on Wednesday night?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I am not.

Q. Turning to the number of text messages that you just read back and forth, you've been in court every day during this trial; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you were here when Mr. Pecker testified?

A. Yes.

Q. And you’re aware that he was shown a number of text messages that he was a participant in; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when he was shown text messages that he was a participant in, you recall questions being asked of him about what he meant by that or what his understanding was of what somebody else sent to him?

A. Yes.

Q. And you agree that the text messages that you just read, you have no personal knowledge about the reason they were sent or even whether they were accurate when they were sent by either of the folks, Ms. Rodriguez or Mr. Howard; do you?

A. No personal knowledge, no.

Q. When, for example, Ms. Rodriguez talks about offers from the Daily Mail and the timing of those offers, you have no knowledge about whether she was telling the truth; do you?

A. No.

Q. And you have no knowledge about any of the —— no knowledge about the truthfulness or the reasoning behind the text that Mr. Howard sent in response, or because of whatever Ms. Rodriguez said; correct?

A. Can you ask that again.

Q. Sure. You have no personal knowledge about either the communications that Mr. Howard initiated or that he responded to in the series of text messages that you were —— that you just read to the jury; correct?

A. Correct.

Q. It's a long way of saying, you just read what was written on the exhibit; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's different, would you agree, than when Mr. Pecker was asked about the reasoning behind text messages and what he meant by that; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And same with Ms. Hicks?

A. Yes.

MR. BLANCHE: Excuse me, your Honor.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Brief pause.

Q. Now, by the way, the same with the text messages of Mr. Cohen, correct, meaning, you didn't read any today, but you have reviewed as part of your work on this case text messages sent and received from Mr. Cohen as well; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, going back briefly to the social media that you reviewed, were you also tasked with reviewing Ms. Daniels' social media over the last couple of years?

A. Yes.

Q. And are you continuing to review it during this trial?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you review it, for example, this week or last night?

A. Not last night, but I think earlier in the week at some point, yeah.

Q. And as part of that review, not limiting it to Ms. Daniels, but to all the parties that your reviewing, when you observe something that you believe to be interesting, what's the process that you use to alert that to your team?

A. Well, I think it depends. I think there are some things that I just know for a fact we would want to have saved to our case file. There are other things I have a question about, I will call one of the attorneys and ask them if they think I should pull it or not.

Q. Basically, not to —— but based upon the information you provide them, the Prosecutors that you work with decide whether to use it or not use it; correct?

A. Basically, yeah.

MR. BLANCHE: No further questions, your Honor.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MS. MANGOLD: No, your Honor.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness excused.

THE COURT: Your next witness.

MR. CONROY: Judge, the People call Jaden Jarmel—Schneider.

COURT OFFICER: County of residence?

THE WITNESS: New York County.

THE COURT: Good afternoon. You may inquire.

MR. CONROY: Thank you.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. CONROY:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Schneider. Where do you work?

A. I work at the New York County District Attorney's Office.

Q. How long have you worked there?

A. Coming up on two years.

Q. And what is your current position there?

A. I am a paralegal.

Q. What are some of the things that you do as a paralegal at the DA's office?

A. It really runs the gamut. But, in general, we help the attorneys: Sending out subpoenas and kind of organizing and analyzing whatever records we receive in response.

Q. In your work as a paralegal at the District Attorney's office, were you assigned to an investigation involving Donald Trump?

A. Yes.

Q. As part of your role in that investigation, were you tasked with analyzing phone records pertaining to the case?

A. Yes.

Q. Was it phone records and also other kinds of records?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the phone records include the AT&T records that are contained in what was admitted earlier today in People's Exhibit 400?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it also include the Verizon records that were admitted into evidence earlier today as People's Exhibit 401?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us, generally, what is contained within those phone records?

A. So we generally get two kinds of records. Subscriber records review basic information about the user associated with the phone record. Call detail records, which are kind of a log of all the incoming and outgoing calls associated with whatever number was subpoenaed.

Q. What format are the phone records in when you get them?

A. Depends on the phone carrier. So, for AT&T, we got them as PDF text files, image files. For Verizon, we get them as Excel spreadsheets and Word documents and PDF.

Q. In your work reviewing various phone records, did you also review information contained in data extractions from Michael Cohen's phones?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you review?

A. I reviewed Cellebrite reports, which is the application used to review the data that is extracted on call logs, contact lists, calendar invites, various pieces of metadata, et cetera.

Q. Did that include what is in evidence —— contact information from those phones, that is in evidence currently as People's 263 and 264?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it include text messages that are in evidence as People's 249 through 251, 255 through 260 and 262?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it include call logs that are in evidence as People's 261?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also review subscriber information contained in People's 400 and 401?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also review a contact list contained in People's 69B in evidence?

A. I did.

Q. In your work on the investigation, did you prepare a summary report —— several summary reports or —— withdrawn. Let me rephrase that. In your work on the investigation, did you prepare a summary report of contact information?

A. I did.

Q. What information did you rely on in making that report?

A. So I looked at the subscriber records that I mentioned from AT&T and Verizon. I also looked at other pieces of documentary records; text messages, records, email signatures, contact lists produced by The Trump Organization. I also looked at the contact lists that were extracted from Mr. Cohen's cell phones.

Q. What was the purpose of creating this report?

A. We wanted to give the jury a sense of how we figured out which phone numbers were associated with which people. Kind of where the phone numbers would show up in the evidence that we ultimately used.

Q. Are the records that you relied on in making this chart all in evidence in this case?

A. Yes.

MR. CONROY: If we can pull up for the Court and parties and the witness, but not the jury, what's been marked as People's 416 for identification.

Q. Do you recognize what that is?

A. Yes.

Q. What is it?

A. This is the phone key I was just talking about.

Q. You created this?

A. I did.

Q. Are there redactions in this chart?

A. Yes.

Q. What is redacted?

A. The first six digits of all the phone numbers.

Q. Other than that, is this an exact copy of the key that you created?

A. Yes.

MR. CONROY: At this time, I would offer People's 416 into evidence.

MR. BOVE: No objection.

THE COURT: 416 is accepted into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibit 416 was accepted into evidence.

MR. CONROY: If we can display that to the jury.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Can you walk us through what we're looking at?

A. Sure. So in the right column under the heading "Exhibit," it shows what the source document was and what exhibit number it came from. In the left column called "Phone Number," it is the phone number. And the next column is the name as it appears on the source document, on the exhibit. Under the "source column," it's just the kind of record; email, text, contact list, et cetera.

Q. For some of the rows, there is one name associated with a number, but then there are multiple sources; why is that?

A. A lot of the phone numbers we saw in several different places, so we put various documents that we found them on just to corroborate that the phone number did belong to the person that is listed next to them.

MR. CONROY: Okay. We can take that down.

Q. I now want to talk about another part of the work that you did with the phone records here. Did you create a number of summaries of phone records?

A. Yes.

Q. What was contained in those summaries?

A. These are just logs of phone calls between pairs of people.

Q. You mentioned that you received the records that we just discussed earlier in a number of file formats, particularly the records now in People's 400 and 401 from AT&T and Verizon. Starting with the AT&T records, how did you go about putting data in the summary?

A. We have a software that reads through the text files, the AT&T files. It allows us to file and sort by phone number, date, caller, et cetera. We uploaded the text files, filtered and sorted and formatted them to look pretty.

Q. What did you do with the Verizon records?

A. So the Verizon records were a particular year. They came in as a PDF. We made them text readable, uploaded the text into Excel, wrote simple scripts to extract the information that was put into a format that was file readable. Then we just filtered again by date and time, caller phone number, et cetera. Then formatted them.

Q. In addition to what's in evidence as People's 400 and 401, did you include any other records in the call summaries?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall what date?

A. In some cases we put calls that were taken off of the call log that is in evidence as 261, which is calls pulled from Mr. Cohen's phone.

Q. What was the purpose of creating these summaries?

A. So, as you might have seen, the phone records are somewhat hard to decipher. They don't list which caller is associated with the phone number. They're all different time zones. And kind of, more importantly, they include a lot of extraneous outside calls of people that are not relevant. We wanted to create summaries that were a bit more digestible and easy and by time zone.

Q. You mentioned different time zones; how did you standardize the records for the time zones?

A. So it differed between AT&T and Verizon. For AT&T, all the time zones were in UTC. We were able to mass convert them to Eastern Standard Time. We accounted for Daylight Savings Time. For Verizon, the time zone depended on the location they were in when they made or received the call. We went through and determined the location, which was listed on the call detail records, and converted them to all New York time, which is to say, we standardized everything to New York time.

Q. Now, are the summaries of the phone records based solely on the information contained in exhibits already in evidence?

A. Yes.

Q. And are those the exhibits we already discussed?

A. Yes.

Q. In preparing the summaries of the phone records, did you ensure that the information you were including in the summaries fairly and accurately reflected the information in the exhibits in evidence?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you do that?

A. So after we made the summaries, we went through line—by—line and compared to the underlying call detail record.

Q. Have you reviewed what's been marked previously as People's 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 for identification?

A. Yes.

Q. And is People's 337 calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 338 calls between Michael Cohen and Hope Hicks?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 339 calls between Michael Cohen and Dylan Howard?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 340 calls between Michael Cohen and David Pecker?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 341 calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Schiller?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 342 calls between Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 344 calls between Keith Davidson and Gina Rodriguez?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 345 calls between Dylan Howard and Keith Davidson?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 346 calls between Dylan Howard and David Pecker?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 347 calls between Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 348 calls between The Trump Organization and Michael Cohen?

A. Yes.

Q. Is People's 349 calls between the Defendant and Michael Cohen?

A. Yes.

Q. And are those the phone summaries that you created?

A. Yes.

MR. CONROY: At this time, I offer People's 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 into evidence.

MR. BOVE: No objection.

THE COURT: 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 are received into evidence.

MR. CONROY: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibits 337 through 342 and 344 through 349 were received and marked into evidence.

MR. CONROY: If we can pull up what's in evidence as People's 342 for everybody.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. And if you could, again, sort of explain to us about what the different columns are and what we're seeing. Is this a representative example of one of the summaries that you created?

A. Somewhat short one, but, yes.

Q. But, basically, they all look the same; some may be longer?

A. Yes.

Q. Is this call between Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg?

A. Yes.

Q. Do we see that on the top left of the chart?

A. Yes.

Q. We saw some redactions. What is redacted in these charts?

A. The first six digits of every phone number.

Q. What are the numbers next to Michael Cohen and the name Allen Weisselberg?

A. Michael Cohen has 0114 and Allen Weisselberg has 7224 and 4509.

Q. Can you walk us through what this chart demonstrates?

A. So the left column is the date and time in Eastern Time. The second column is the date and time in UTC, which is how it was originally recorded in the AT&T records. The "time" column tells whether the call is a text or voicemail. The "from" tells you who the call is from, the phone number. And the "to" column tells you who the call is to. The "duration: Is how long the call was, the minutes. The "source: Column tells you which phone carrier or where we got the records from.

Q. Thank you. And, again, I am not going to walk through all of the exhibits we admitted. Do they all have the same format?

A. Yes.

MR. CONROY: Thank you. You can take that down. Could we now pull up what is in evidence as People's 247.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Do you recognize what this is?

A. I do.

Q. What is it?

A. This is a Cellebrite report showing the metadata associated with the recording that was extracted from Michael Cohen's phone.

Q. Can you see on this report the approximate time that the recording ended?

A. Not exactly, but you can figure it out. The timestamp of the recording is 10:56 and 42 seconds a.m. in New York time. And the duration of the recording is 2 minutes and 51 seconds. If you add them together, the recording ended at 10:59 and about 30 seconds a.m. in New York City time.

MR. CONROY: Okay. We can take that down.

Q. Did you also review the call records already in evidence as People's 400 and 401?

A. I did.

Q. Did you review records relating to the phone ending in 0114?

A. Yes.

Q. Who did that phone number belong to?

A. Michael Cohen.

Q. Did you identify incoming calls to that phone number that began at approximately the same time as the recording ended?

A. Yes.

MR. CONROY: Could we pull up from People's 400 the page, Bates Number DANY ID DJ00002726, which is redacted, to be displayed.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Do you see the call that we just talked about on here?

A. Yes.

Q. What line number is that call on this report?

A. It’s line 6126192.

Q. And what was the connection time on that call?

A. This is 2:59 and 53 seconds in UTC time. At that time of year, that would have been at 10:59 and 53 seconds New York City time.

Q. How long was the seizure time on this call?

A. Twenty—three seconds.

Q. And what is the time of this call in relation to when the recording ended that we just looked at on People's 247?

A. So the recording ended at 10:59 and about 30 seconds a.m. Eastern Time. So this call was connected about 20, 22, 23 seconds later.

MR. CONROY: Thank you. We can pull that down. Now, can we pull up just for the parties and the witness and the Judge what has been marked as People’s 350 for identification.

Q. Do you recognize this?

A. I do.

Q. What is this?

A. This is a summary chart of what’s in evidence as People’s Exhibits 1 through 34.

Q. Did you review and confirm People 350 for identification?

A. I did.

Q. Can you describe how you did that?

A. So I looked at the chart and I went back to each exhibit that it references and cross—referenced to make sure everything was accurately reflected.

Q. What kinds of documents are People’s 1 through 34?

A. They are invoices, vouchers from The Trump Organization’s Multi Data System and checks.

Q. And does the information in the chart that we designated People's Exhibit 350 for identification exactly reflect information taken from People's Exhibit 1 through 34 in evidence?

A. Yes.

MR. BOVE: I do have an objection. If we can go to sidebar.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebarz

MR. BOVE: Judge, our objection is just —— our objection is to the text on the bottom right, "false business records," or something like to that effect. Some things popped up on the screen. Has it been modified?

MR. CONROY: No.

MR. BOVE: They're doing it advance. They’re anticipating my objection.

MR. CONROY: You said your objection ——

MR. BOVE: Judge, this is unduly argumentative.

MR. CONROY: This is a summary of the 34 business records, and essentially it's to assist the jury in associating the specific business records with counts. We have no problem with some kind of instruction to the jury that the title is not in evidence, but these are records that we're alleging are business records.

THE COURT: What is the purpose for introducing it into evidence now? You can probably do it on summation. You can do it in summation. I think it would be perfectly appropriate at that time.

MR. CONROY: So could we —— I am just trying to think how we can modify it. Can we call it "alleged false business records?"

MR. BOVE: There is a title. It says, "The Counts." I think if you can keep the text on the top, just redact the title on the bottom. Just get the summary in.

THE COURT: You have it. I think for summation you won't have an argument. Okay?

MR. CONROY: Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

THE COURT: Mr. Bove, we resolved your objection as discussed at the bench.

MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.

MR. CONROY: If we can —— when you are ready, display just for the parties, the Court and the witness the summary chart again. Judge, at this time the People offer People's 350 for identification into evidence.

MR. BOVE: As modified, no objection.

THE COURT: Subject to redaction.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibit 350 was received into evidence.

MR. CONROY: If we can display that for everybody.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION 7 BY MR . CONROY:

Q. Can you just walk us through, again —— first of all, what is this summarizing?

A. This is summarizing People's Exhibits 1 through 34 in evidence.

Q. And are there three different rows?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us what each row indicates?

A. The top row are invoices. The middle row are vouchers. And the bottom row are the checks.

Q. And, then, are there columns by month?

A. Yes.

Q. Starting with the invoices, is there only one invoice for the months of January and February?

A. Yes.

Q. And below that, for January and February, are there two vouchers?

A. Yes.

Q. What information is included in this chart for the vouchers?

A. The dollar amount of the voucher entry in some of the months, and all of the months the number associated with the voucher entry.

Q. Just going back up to the invoice, what information is included in the invoice row?

A. The date of the invoice and the dollar amount requested on the invoice.

Q. And then below those two things, there is something called "count number," what is that?

A. Each of these exhibits is associated with a count in the indictment. So, the red "count number" corresponds to that count.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporte

Q And if we could just continue going down January and February, those two columns, we talked about the one invoice, two vouchers; and is there only one check?

A Yes.

Q How many invoices were there, in total, on this chart?

A Eleven.

Q And can you just read which counts they’re associated with?

A Counts 1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32.

Q After January and February, is there one invoice for each month for the rest of the year?

A Yes.

Q Going down to vouchers, same question. Could you just read the count number for each of the vouchers?

A Sure. Counts 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33.

Q And is there one voucher for every month in 2017?

A Yes.

A Sure. It’s counts 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34.

Q And after January and February, is there one check for each of the remaining months in 2017?

A Yes.

Q And if we look at the column —— the column all the way on the right where there are just three blue boxes, can you tell us what those are?

A It’s just tallying up the number of each category of record.

Q And then, at the bottom where it says "business records"?

A This is the total number of business records.

Q Is that also the total number of counts in the indictment?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: I have nothing further.

THE COURT: Mr. Bove, please.

MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge. May I inquire?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. BOVE: Thank you.

CROSS—EXAMINATION BY MR. BOVE:

A Whichever is easier for you.

Q What’s your preference?

A Jarmel—Schneider. Thank you.

Q Mr. Jarmel—Schneider, you testified about some call summary charts; right?

A Yes.

Q That sounded like a lot of work.

A Yes.

Q At times, arguably, tedious work?

A Could be.

Q The tolling.

A Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it.

Q I hear that. Respect.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Laughter from the audience.

Q A lot of that work had to take place before the trial; right?

A All of it.

Q Because you've been sitting over here (indicating) the whole trial; correct?

A Yes.

Q So, you know that there were summaries that were sort of finalized from a quality control perspective, from your standpoint, and then produced to President Trump before the trial; right?

A What do you mean?

Q Versions of those charts that were marked as exhibits, produced and marked as exhibits, were produced to the defense before the trial; right?

A Yes.

Q Those are the ones that passed muster, from your perspective?

A I would like to think they all did.

Q Right. The ones that were produced before the trial?

A Yes.

Q Just so we’re clear, the ones that are in evidence now are not actually summaries of every toll between the participants on the chart; right?

A No. That would be tens of hundreds of thousands of calls.

Q Just as an example, going to Exhibit 337 is a call summary chart, calls between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson.

A Yes.

Q And the one that’s admitted in evidence is not a summary of every toll that you have between those two individuals; right?

A Right. We narrowed down by a time period.

Q So, there were some deletions from the charts made this week; right?

A Uh, I guess so.

Q When you say "narrowed down", some things were cut?

A Yes.

Q And so, for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson, there’s about a page—and—a—half of calls cut from 2018; right?

A I don't know from the top of my head.

Q Let me think about the best way to do this. I want to show you what’s been marked for identification as Defense P—1.

MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, this is just for the parties, the Court and the witness.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

MR. BOVE: If we could flip to the page that has Government Exhibit 337.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

Q You see that?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: If you can hold on one second. I think we’re having technical difficulty.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Defense confers.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

Q This is the Government’s Exhibit List, right; you recognize that?

A This is some version of it, yes.

MR. BOVE: Can we take a look at the first page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

Q You see it’s dated April 16, 2024?

A Yes.

Q That’s right after the trial started; right?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: If we can go back to the part that reflects Exhibits 336 and 337.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

Q There’s Bates ranges in the far—right column; right?

A Yes.

Q Those are, basically, the page numbers that were on this exhibit when it was given to the Defense; right?

A Yes.

Q Do you have a hard copy of 336 up there?

A I do not.

MR. BOVE: Can I trouble the Government for a hard copy of 337?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the People give documents to Mr. Bove, who then gives the document to the court officer to give to the witness, and the witness reviews the document

Q People’s Exhibit 337 has Bates numbers, and I’ll use it to compare —— just a few pages; right?

A That’s right.

Q Because some pages were deleted; right?

A Yes.

Q And they’re from 2018; correct?

A Yes.

Q And you were here during the cross—examination of Keith Davidson; right?

A I was.

Q And you were here when the Defense admitted recordings of conversations between Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen; right?

A I was.

Q And then, a subsequent decision was made to delete toll records from the summary chart in 2018?

A No. I don't think that’s correct.

Q You don’t think that time sequence is correct?

A I think the time sequence is correct ——

Q I’m not going to ask you about the purpose. I'm just asking about the time sequence. You were here early this morning when there were some text messages read between Dylan Howard and Gina Rodriguez; right?

A Yes.

Q You admitted a call summary marked Government Exhibit 344 of marked call records of Keith Davidson and Gina Rodriguez; right?

A Yes.

Q That's another exhibit where, this week, a significant number of calls were removed; right?

A I don’t know about "significant", but they were shortened.

Q Three pages worth?

A I don’t know off the top of my head.

MR. BOVE: Mr. Conroy, do you have a copy of 344?

MR. CONROY: I need the Bates number. Who is it between?

MR. STEINGLASS: Rodriguez and Davidson.

MR. BOVE: 4269.

Q Just to try to move along, you remember deleting several pages from 344; correct?

A Yes.

Q Now, you also testified about some call summaries relating to Michael Cohen; correct?

A Correct.

Q And one of the phone numbers that you looked at with respect to Michael Cohen ended in 0144; right?

A 0114.

Q That's the attention to detail I was talking about. Thank you. So, that’s a number that you had to get familiar with because it cut across a bunch of these charts; right?

A Yes.

Q You testified that you also familiarized yourself with the electronic phone evidence that's been presented here at the trial; correct?

A Yes.

Q And that came in through Mr. Daus; right?

A Correct.

Q And he testified about the contents of two cell phones; right?

A Yes.

Q He called them CPl and CP2. Do you remember that?

A Yes.

Q CPl was associated with the phone number 0114 was his testimony; right?

A That’s correct.

Q And you looked at those —— the data extracted from those phones to help prepare the summaries; right?

A Yes.

Q Do you recall what that IMEI number was associated with —— you can say no —— with CPl?

A It’s like a 20—digit code. I don’t know.

MR. BOVE: If we could bring up for the witness, the parties, and the Court, Defense Exhibit G—lO. Go to Page 3, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens of the witness and the parties.

Q Do you see it says "IMEI" labeled at the bottom? It ends in 997431; correct?

A Correct.

Q So, that's the IMEI associated with the device Mr. Daus talked about as CP1; right?

A That’s my understanding, yes.

Q He said it had the number ending 0114; correct?

A Correct.

MR. BOVE: If we could take a look at Government 319. It’s in evidence. Everybody can look at this one.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q You remember some testimony about this. It’s a screenshot of a text message; right?

A Yes.

Q And there were some questions about whether there were phone calls around the time of that bottom message. Do you see what that message says?

A Yes.

Q "The President wants to know if you called David Pecker again?" Do you see that?

A Yes.

Q At this trial, you’re sort of the guardian of the toll records; right?

A I don't know if I’d say that, but if you say so.

Q There are no toll records in evidence that reflect calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker around this time period; are there?

A I don't think that’s true, but I would have to look at the underlying records.

Q Do you know what they’re marked?

A It would be in either People’s 400 or 401. Hope Hicks wasn’t a part of the Verizon records, so it would be in 401.

Q And there’s no call summary chart between the phone calls between Hope Hicks and David Pecker; is that correct?

A That's correct.

Q The last thing I want to talk about the Government Exhibit 247, which is in evidence.

MR. BOVE: If you could bring that up, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

MR. BOVE: Zoom in as best we can.

Q So, this is that recording file off the physical device marked CPl; right?

A Yes.

Q And you said based on the file name —— there's that timestamp, time field, that it is dated September 6, 2016?

A Yes. That’s the timestamp.

Q And then we looked at Government Exhibit 400 for a call that you said came in around this time?

A Around the time that the recording ended.

MR. BOVE: And so, if we could bring up Government Exhibit 400 with the Bates ending 2726, please. If we could ask the Government to do this so we could have the right redactions.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

MR. BOVE: This can be for everybody. We can zoom in on rows 2691 and 92, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Mr. Conroy asked you some questions about the second one, 26192; right?

A Uh—huh. Yes.

Q And —— but, the one above it, 26191, is related; correct?

A It’s the same call.

Q It’s the call that goes to a voicemail; right?

A The first one?

MR. CONROY: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q 26191 is a missed call that goes to a voicemail, reflected in 26192; correct?

A That’s not my understanding.

Q Were you here this morning when Mr. Dixon testified?

A Yeah. Can I explain?

Q I’m just going to ask you some questions.

A Yes, I understand.

Q You can be questioned again by Mr. Conroy. You were here when he testified; correct?

A Yes.

Q I asked him some questions on the feature call on the right.

A Yes.

Q You see where it says "VM"?

A Yes.

Q For voicemail?

A Yes.

Q That’s the way he explained it; correct?

A Yes.

Q That’s what he said?

A Yes.

Q So, this call, then —— the call reflected in 26192, according to Mr. Dixon’s testimony, reflects a voicemail; does it not?

A If that’s what he said. I —— I don’t want to testify to something I’m not an expert in.

Q But, you were here when he said VM means voicemail; right?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: If we could zoom out, please. Just to get oriented.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q The three columns there, the right side there's a field that says IMEI; right?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: If we could zoom in on the IMEI column of this whole page, please.

Q You were here when Mr. Dixon said the IMEI is the number associated with the physical device itself; right?

A Yes. I think you’re blowing up the wrong column, but that is my understanding also. Sorry.

Q Thank you. Do we have the IMEI up now?

A Yes.

Q So, you were here when Mr. Dixon said this IMEI number is the number associated with the physical device itself; right?

A Yes.

Q So, this IMEI associated with the two calls, the missed call and the voicemail that we just talked about, ends 4913; right?

A That's correct.

Q You just reminded us, did you not, that the IMEI associated with the CPl phone ends 4731?

A That's correct.

Q So, it's a different device; right?

A That's right.

Q So, it's a voicemail; correct?

A If you say so.

Q Well, it's "VM"?

A Yes.

Q You were here when Mr. Dixon said it; right?

A Yes.

Q So, it's a voicemail to a different physical device than the one Mr. Daus testified about; right?

A To a different physical device, yes.

MR. BOVE: Nothing further, Judge.

THE COURT: Thank you. Any redirect?

MR. CONROY: Just a few questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. CONROY:

Q I just want to talk, first, about the summary charts that you did. All of the calls on those charts are in evidence in other places; is that right?

A Yes.

Q Does that include the calls that Mr. Bove was talking about that when we cut down on the charts, those calls are all still in evidence; correct?

A Yes.

Q Why, if you know —— if you know, why were those exhibits shortened?

A My understanding is that the decision was always going to be that we would admit the parts of the call summaries that were related to what had come out in trial. That’s the point of doing summary charts. We’re pretty far down the road now, so we made decisions about which parts of them to include.

Q And you were asked a couple of questions about the fact that you knew that the charts —— the original summary charts had been turned over to the Defense; is that right?

A Yes.

Q And you know that the new versions had also been turned over to the Defense; right?

A That’s correct.

Q And were you aware that there was no objection to those charts coming into evidence?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: If we could pull up what we were just looking at, the page from People’s 400 with the Bates ending 2726.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

MR. CONROY: If we could pull up the same two lines we were just looking at, 26191 and 92.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q I believe, earlier, or just a minute or two ago on cross—examination, there was something you wanted to explain about what you saw in this call that interrupted the call that's in evidence as 246. Can you explain that for us?

A Sure. So, Mr. Bove —— Bove —— sorry —— asked me if these were two related calls and if the first one was a missed call. My understanding is this was one call that had two legs. I’m not sure exactly where it went. But, this is how AT&T reported a single call that hit multiple stop points through their system before being connected. That was the clarification.

Q Okay. If you know, do people sometimes get new phones and keep the same phone number?

A I do.

Q Meaning, you do get a new phone and keep the same phone number?

A Yes.

MR. CONROY: I have nothing further. Thank you.

THE COURT: Mr. Bove?

MR. BOVE: Yes. Just briefly. If we could just bring that back up on the screen.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

RECROSS—EXAMINATION BY MR. BOVE:

Q The significance of this call is that the recording from the phone CP1 cut off; right?

A Correct.

Q Cuts off mid—conversation; correct?

A I don’t know if it cut off mid—conversation or at the end of the conversation.

Q It cuts off at some point in the conversation; right?

A It ends.

Q Right. And it ends before the President is done speaking to Mr. Cohen; correct?

MR. CONROY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q You just gave, essentially, what is a hypothesis about these two calls on the screens; right?

A I am just describing the timestamps on the calls.

Q But, you’re not accounting for what’s on the right side that says voicemail?

A I don’t think that’s true. I apologize. I don't think I’m not accounting for it. I mean, the significance of the call is the timestamp.

Q Well, that’s part of the significance. The other part is whether or not the phone call was actually answered.

A Not necessarily. I’m not sure if the recording would have actually cut off whether it was answered or not. Could have been it just came in, cut off automatically. I don’t know.

Q Right. You were here during Mr. Daus’ testimony; correct?

A Yes.

Q You were here when I asked him: You could not do any forensic analysis to determine the interplay between an incoming call and the voice recording data; right?

MR. CONROY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q You are aware the recording cuts off, and that’s why you were looking for a toll like this?

A Yes.

MR. BOVE: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. CONROY: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Thank you, sir. You can step down.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness is excused.

THE COURT: People, is that it for today?

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Jurors, we're going to stop at this time. Before I excuse you, I am required to give you these admonitions: I remind you to please not talk either among yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all the evidence is in, I have given my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin deliberations. Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any benefit or payment in return for supplying information concerning the trial.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Defense confers.

THE COURT: Are you done?

MR. BOVE: Sorry.

THE COURT: Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge or attempt by anyone to improperly influence you or any member of the jury. Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. Do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony. Do not read, nor listen to any accounts or discussions related to the case. That includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts in the trial or the reading of posts on any court sites. Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, telephone, or the internet. Do not Google or search for any information about the case, the law which applies to the case, or the people involved in the case. Have a good weekend. See you Monday at 9:30.

COURT OFFICER: All rise.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jurors and the alternate jurors are excused.

THE COURT: Please be seated. Mr. Blanche, I was going to ask the People if I could have a copy of People's 350. I think it would be helpful to the Court in preparing the jury charges. I wanted to ask if there's any objection to my receiving that now.

MR. BLANCHE: May I just have one moment?

THE COURT: Sure.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Defense confers.

THE COURT: Was that the number of the document chart, 350?

MR. CONROY: Yes, Judge.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Defense confers)

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we're fine with that.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLANCHE: On the same topic, our intention was to submit it to the Court, as the Court might have some proposed charges as well. There's certainly no objection to the Court reviewing that.

THE COURT: Thank you. I appreciate that. That was going to be my next thing. You should feel free to start submitting any special instructions that you want. We will definitely have a pre—charge conference at the appropriate time. I will make my final decisions then. You can start bringing matters to my attention now, if you like. Tell me about scheduling for next week.

MR. STEINGLASS: Um, we expect to call ——

THE COURT: Two witnesses?

MR. STEINGLASS: Yes. Potentially, two witnesses; and I think it’s entirely possible that we will rest by the end of next week.

THE COURT: Okay. All right.

MR. STEINGLASS: Also, there was one other evidentiary matter that Mr. Conroy wanted to raise with the Court if this is a good time.

THE COURT: Sure. It is.

MR. CONROY: This relates to an exhibit numbered People’s 79, which is a copy of a Severance Agreement for Allen Weisselberg. We’ve had, I think, some conversation with Counsel about this. My understanding —— but I’m sure they’ll let me know if I’m wrong —— is that while they object to it coming into evidence, if your Honor finds it admissible, they will not —— we will not need to call a witness to put it in. Is that accurate? It’s sort of a relevance objection.

MR. BOVE: Right. We just want to resolve our other legal objections. It will come in authenticity—wise subject to the Court’s ruling.

THE COURT: Can I take a look at it?

MR. CONROY: Sure. Actually, your Honor, I’ll hand up a copy of the chart that’s in evidence as 350 with that, as well.

THE COURT: Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the People give the Court documents.

THE COURT: Mr. Bove, what’s your objection?

MR. BOVE: Judge, this is the Separation Agreement between The Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg. Mr. Weisselberg’s absence from this trial is a very complicated issue. I wouldn’t be surprised if there ends up being a foundation for a missing witness instruction about the uncalled witnesses being equally unavailable to both sides. His posture in this trial is as a hearsay declarant, which the Government is using, basically, in that capacity as a witness. Their theory is he conspired, I think, with Mr. Cohen; that he gave instructions to Mr. McConney. He is in that way, I submit, an uncalled Government witness. To offer this Agreement, which I think would be offered as a way to sort of impeach their own hearsay declarant and suggest there’s some kind of bias and motive that he has to either not be here or acting in a certain way, raises a number of complexities in light of Mr. Weisselberg's overall situation. We think it’s unduly prejudicial. And it’s not particularly relevant, especially in a situation where they are offering —— where the Government is offering his statements. I think this would look differently if we had sought to offer hearsay from him. That’s not what we were doing.

THE COURT: So, it’s a hearsay objection?

MR. BOVE: Not quite. Because, as I said, just to make sure, there’s no business records hearsay objection. If your Honor overrules this right now, we’re going to stipulate. Our objection is to relevance and undue prejudice. We don’t think it’s relevant that he entered into this Agreement after—the—fact. And we think it's unduly prejudicial and confusing in light of the fact that Mr. Weisselberg is in prison right now and not available to anyone.

THE COURT: So, I understand the relevance of the objection. Help me understand the undue prejudice objection a little bit more.

MR. BOVE: As a result of Mr. Weisselberg’s legal situation, I think that he would, likely —— if either side tried to call him, he would, likely, invoke. We are not able to elicit testimony because of those circumstances. We're not able to elicit testimony that would, potentially, impeach some of the hearsay that has been offered. And I think the Government is probably in a similar situation. He is, in effect, their witness at this trial as a hearsay declarant. In that way, we don’t think the Government is able to impeach their own hearsay declarant, even in this form of impeachment, that he entered into a Settlement Agreement after—the—fact, based on a host of situations that we don’t think is relevant at this trial. We think those two considerations require that this not come in because of the confusion it would add.

THE COURT: Thanks . People?

MR. CONROY: Judge, as the Court is aware, there has been —— there probably will be more discussion of Mr. Weisselberg and various things related to him in the case. And what we are looking to do is explain, from our perspective, why he's not here. I am sure there will be arguments made by Counsel about whether he should have been here and what not being here means. I think we need this Agreement. Our view is that Mr. Weisselberg’s interests right now are very aligned with the Defendant’s. I think this Agreement points that out. Among other things, there are three payments due Mr. Weisselberg during this calendar year for $250,000 each; one in June, one in September, and one in December. Also, if you take a look at the Agreement, particularly in Section 3, Employee Promises, in 3(B): The employee promises not to verbally or in writing disparage, criticize or denigrate the company or any of its current or former entities, directors, managers, employees, owners or representatives. In Sub D, under 3: The employee promises that, except for acts or testimony directly compelled by subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, he will not communicate with, provide information to or otherwise cooperate in any way with any other —— with any other person or entity, including his counsel or other agents having or claiming to have any adverse claims against the company, or any person or entity released by this Agreement with regard to the adverse claims, or to take any action to induce, encourage, instigate, aid, abet, or otherwise cause any person or entity to bring or file a complaint, charge, lawsuit or other proceeding of any kind against the company or any person or entity released by this Agreement. Those are just a couple of the provisions. And Counsel referred to trying to impeach his credibility. We’re not trying to do that. What we’re trying to do is explain his absence. I think, or I would submit, that this Agreement offers a real explanation for why he is not going to be here in this trial.

MR. BOVE: We just, respectfully, disagree with that. This Agreement is not the reason that Mr. Weisselberg is not at this trial. Jeff McConney has a substantial similar Agreement that is in evidence, but he testified at this trial. And his availability or lack thereof is much more straight—forward, has similar terms. Nobody tried to invoke that Agreement to prevent him from testifying. That’s just not the case. That's not the reason Mr. Weisselberg is not here. The reason Mr. Weisselberg is not a witness to either side is because the District Attorney’s Office initiated a perjury prosecution in the lead—up to this case. Even that sentence, I know, is a very complicated sentence, Judge. My point is, to get into any of this, it would all have to come out. It’s just a rabbit hole that I think is unnecessary for —— and it is being offered to impeach Mr. Weisselberg. It’s being offered to show a bias and a motive that the Government’s own hearsay declarant, they’re saying, has. It’s a much more complicated situation than that. For those reasons, we don’t think it’s relevant. And if it is, it should not come in because of the prejudice.

MR. CONROY: Very quickly, Judge, with respect to Mr. McConney, I believe he’s gotten all of his payments, and his Agreement has sort of ended. The other thing I would say is, if Counsel prefers, we would be willing to stipulate that Mr. Weisselberg is in jail for perjury if that solves the problem.

THE COURT: I think that that would be one way to solve the problem. My question is, has anyone attempted to get him to come in in some way, by serving him with a subpoena or —— in other words, try to compel his testimony?

MR. CONROY: Judge, the People have not.

THE COURT: And have you? You have an obligation.

MR. BOVE: NO.

THE COURT: You referred to how "both sides" are having difficulty with this issue.

MR. BOVE: If I said it that way, I mis —— my point is, I think there’s an equally shared access issue. They have chosen to call or not call him. We, obviously, have no burden here. We have not taken steps to try and call him at this trial. It’s just —— it would not resolve the situation if we stipulated that he was in prison for perjury. I think it actually further supports my point, which is, there are a host of reasons that Mr. Weisselberg is not going to be a witness in this case. They, the Government, have chosen to not take steps to call him. It’s a very complicated situation. It’s not completely explained by this document. It would be misleading to allow this document in by itself. It would be further prejudicial —— I'm not suggesting your Honor is requiring for us to stipulate —— for us to stipulate to some negotiated statement about the perjury situation. And we think that all of this is sort of a sideshow for somebody that is —— the Government’s hearsay declarant, who they shouldn’t be permitted to impeach in the first place.

MR. CONROY: The last thing —— hopefully the last thing, it’s not that it’s the reason, but it’s a reason, and it’s a significant reason that helps explain why he’s not here.

THE COURT: I think it would be helpful to me making my decision if I could see that some efforts were taken to compel his appearance. I don’t have to do this right now; right?

MR. CONROY: No.

THE COURT: Let me think about it. Right now, it seems to me that we’re kind of trying to jump the gun. We want to explain why he’s not here, without having made every effort to get him here. Section 3(C) —— actually, it’s 3(D), it says: Except for acts or testimony directly compelled by subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. It seems to me, if I’m understanding correctly, that that step has not yet been taken. Not that it has to be taken. It’s a factor for me in making this decision.

MR. STEINGLASS: Can I just say one thing on that, Judge?

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. STEINGLASS: While it’s true that we could subpoena him and put him up there cold, the Agreement seems to preclude us from talking to him or him talking to us at the risk of losing $750,000 of outstanding severance pay. So, while it is, theoretically, our prerogative to try to subpoena him, put him up, and see if he would take the Fifth Amendment in real—time, but do this cold, is a —— I don’t think is really the entire point. Even if it’s —— even if it’s relevant, I don't think it’s the entire point. I think that that Agreement has a very palpable connection to why that could be an exercise in futility or a strategically bad decision, to put a witness on the stand who is under an Agreement like that.

THE COURT: Right . I think one way to possibly deal with that is to do it out of the presence of the jury and put him on the stand. He can have counsel present. He can be asked a few questions, and he can say, "I’m not going to answer the questions," and then we can go through the steps that are required for me to find that he’s either unavailable or unwilling to testify.

MR. STEINGLASS: We could do that, Judge, but then we would still be under the situation of calling the witness to the stand who's under no obligation with us.

THE COURT: Right . Then it would be on the record and I’ve seen it.

MR . STEINGLASS: Right .

THE COURT: Right now, we’re speculating. We're speculating he would honor an Agreement. We’re speculating the degree to which this Agreement dictates he could not speak to you. We’re speculating to the advice he may or may not be given by counsel. It’s difficult to rule like that.

MR. BOVE: I want to make one last point, because we’re contemplating a lot of process around this. Mr. Weisselberg has never been on the Government’s witness list. So, to suddenly try and create this procedure to get around a way to admit this document —— I think we were procedurally barred this morning from offering an exhibit. I think there are procedural problems with trying to add him to the witness list at this point, as well.

THE COURT: I don’t see what one thing has to do with the other. We’re not creating any procedure. This is done. This is done with some frequency. I’ve had people produced from jail testify. I’ve had other people, who were unwilling to, testify. But, the only way to know that is to put them on the stand, out of the presence of the jury, on the record, under oath.

MR. BOVE: My point is slightly different, is that even if Mr. Weisselberg came to this trial and was now willing to testify for any number of reasons he might decide to, we were entitled to notice of that long before this trial started. That's the point I was making.

THE COURT: Did you think there was a possibility that at some point the People might call Allen Weisselberg to testify?

MR. BOVE: Not based on the witness list, no.

THE COURT: Is there anything else?

MR. STEINGLASS: No, thank you.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we have an application with respect to Mr. Cohen. It’s —— we’ve been pushing the Court, at the risk of stating the obvious, regarding the Gag Order. Mr. Cohen continues to speak publicly about this trial and about President Trump. As recently as, I believe, Wednesday night, he was on TikTok, this time talking extensively about —— he was wearing a white T—shirt with a picture of President Trump behind bars, wearing an orange jumpsuit, and discussing about how he’s now announcing he’s running for Congress. Our request is, now that we have one week left in the trial, that he be prohibited from talking. The same way President Trump is. The case law speaks to your Honor having the power to do this. Sheppard v. Maxwell explicitly states: There may be instances where the Court not only needs to stop extrajudicial statements from the parties and the lawyers, but also from the witnesses or court officials. Your Honor, it's Friday. We have a couple of days left. It’s now becoming —— it's becoming a problem every single day that President Trump is not allowed to respond to this witness, but this witness is allowed to continue to talk. He has stated on social media that he’s going to stop talking a couple of different times, and he doesn’t. So, our request is that the Court order —— order the Government to instruct the witness to not talk about President Trump or —— or this case until the case is over.

THE COURT: Mr. Steinglass?

MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, we have repeatedly instructed all of the witnesses in this case, to the extent that we have any control over it, to refrain from making public statements. The fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do. We have repeatedly, repeatedly asked the witnesses not to do that. Not just Mr. Cohen. All the witnesses. The fact of the matter is, these witnesses are not subject to the Gag Order, and we have no remedy if they engage in those activities. So, all we can do —— if the Court is —— if Mr. Blanche is asking the Court to order the People to order the witnesses not to do something, we have already done that. Or, to the extent that we have already asked, we have no power to order. And, there’s nothing, really, more to say about that.

THE COURT: It might be a little bit of a new answer, but I would direct the People to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements about this case, about Mr. Trump, or about anything related to this case or the process; that that comes from the Bench and that you are communicating that on behalf of the Bench.

MR. STEINGLASS: We will do SO. Thank you.

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you. I’ll see you Monday.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the case is adjourned to 5—13—2024 at 9:30 AM

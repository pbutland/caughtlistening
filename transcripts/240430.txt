THE COURT: Good morning. Please be seated.

THE CLERK: Calling from the Part 59 calendar, calendar number 1 and 2, SMZ 71762 of '24 and SMZ 71764 of '24. Donald Trump. Appearances.

MR. STEINGLASS: For the People, ADAs Joshua Steinglass, Becky Mangold, Susan Hoffinger, Christopher Conroy, Matthew Colangelo and Katherine Ellis.

MR. BLANCHE: Good morning. I am Todd Blanche. And I am joined by Emil Bove, Susan Necheles and Kendra Wharton. Good morning.

THE COURT: Good morning. We have a couple of housekeeping matters first. I know that both sides wanted to work something out with the sound system. It's my understanding that that is going to be worked out? There is a plan in place?

MR. STEINGLASS: I believe so. Yes, Judge.

MR. BLANCHE: Yes. I think we're working it out, and we will try to be as efficient as we can and make it as smooth as possible.

THE COURT: The second issue. At the start of the trial, Mr. Blanche, you had requested two days for high school graduations, one for Mr. Trump and one for a colleague. Can you tell me what those days were?

MR. BLANCHE: Yes, your Honor.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Counsel confer.

MR. BLANCHE: May 17th and June 3rd.

THE COURT: All right. We got through the jury selection really quickly, I think we are ahead of schedule and I think we have been moving well ahead since, so I don't think that the May 17th date is a problem. So Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date -- attend his son's graduation. June 3rd, it's really up to you. I think, at that point, the jury might be deliberating. It could be a challenge.

MS. NECHELES: I understand, your Honor. And, of course, if they are deliberating --

THE COURT: And if they are not deliberating, I think that that will be fine as well.

MS. NECHELES: Thank you.

THE COURT: I believe the clerk of the court called the SMZs into the record. Let the record reflect that I'm about to hand down the Court's decisions on the hearing that we had for contempt, on SMZ-71762 of '24, which covered Counts 1 through 3. The Court finds that the People have met their burden of proof and demonstrated contempt as to the second and third incident, but not as to the first. Mr. Trump is fined a thousand dollars on each of those two. As to SMZ-71764 of '24, covering incidents 4 through 10, the Court finds the People have met their burden as to all of those. And the Court imposes a punishment of $1,000 on each of those six. I am handing down written decision copies for both sides. The details of the decision are in the written decision.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Handed.

MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anything else that I need to go over before we get back to the witness?

MR. STEINGLASS: There are a few matters, Judge, but I don't think that they necessarily have to be discussed before the witness.

THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Blanche?

MR. BLANCHE: The same with what Mr. Steinglass just said.

THE COURT: Let's take the witness, please. The date for payment is in the Order.

THE COURT OFFICER: Witness entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The witness, Gary Farro, having been previously sworn, enters the courtroom and resumed the witness stand.

THE WITNESS: Good morning.

THE COURT: Good morning, sir. Welcome back.

THE WITNESS: Good morning, your Honor.

THE COURT: I remind you that you are still under oath. Please have a seat.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE COURT: All right. We can get the jury.

THE COURT OFFICER: All rise. Jury entering.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury enters.

THE COURT: Please be seated.

THE CLERK: Continuing case on trial, People versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are present.

THE COURT: Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. I hope you had a good weekend. People.

MS. MANGOLD: Thank you, your Honor.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. MANGOLD:

Q Good morning, Mr. Farro.

A Good morning.

Q Welcome back.

A Thank you.

Q So before we adjourned on Friday, I think you were talking to the jury about a call from Michael Cohen that you received on October 26th, 2016; is that right?

A That's correct.

Q And you testified that he was -- he had called to open a new bank account for an entity called Essential Consultants LLC; right?

A That's correct.

Q And we discussed a form that you called a KYC form?

A Yes.

Q I think you explained it stands for "Know Your Customer?"

A Yes.

Q And is that an account opening document required by First Republic Bank?

A Yes, it is.

Q Is that the only document that a client is required to submit to open a new bank account?

A No. They need to provide a master signature card, which shows who the signers are on the account, as well as the documentation to support, if it's a business account. In this case, it was a LLC account, so they have to provide us with the LLC documentation as well.

Q Can you remind everyone again what "LLC" stands for?

A Limited Liability Company.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we display People's Exhibit 371, which is already in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

THE COURT: For everyone; right?

MS. MANGOLD: For everybody, yes.

Q Can you see that on your screen, Mr. Farro?

A Yes, I can.

Q Is this a First Republic Bank email?

A Yes.

Q A series of emails?

A Yes, it is.

Q Could we focus on the top two emails in the chain, please?

A Certainly.

Q Now, looking at the middle email. Who is that from?

A That's from Elizabeth Rappaport, who was my assistant.

Q Your assistant?

A Yes.

Q And who is it to?

A It is to Melissa Duran, Client Service Group New York, and DeWitt Hutchins.

Q And who is Melissa Duran?

A Melissa Duran worked in our Client Service Group, and specifically handled some of the wire transactions.

Q And would you remind everyone who DeWitt Hutchins is?

A DeWitt Hutchins, at the time, was a preferred banker working in the 56th and Madison office.

Q What is the date of this email?

A October 26th, 2016.

Q Is that the same day that Mr. Cohen called you to open the Essential Consultants account?

A Yes, it is.

Q Can you read this email to the jury?

A "DeWitt - please provide the account docs for Michael Cohen. Thank you."

Q I'm directing you to the top email on the page. Do you see that there is an attachment?

A Yes, there is a PDF as well as another image.

MS. MANGOLD: And if we could briefly flip through the remainder of this document.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Are Pages 3 through 9 of this PDF the other account opening documents for Essential Consultants LLC?

A Yes. This is what I referenced prior.

MS. MANGOLD: And can we turn now to Page 3 of the PDF.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Focus on the top half of the page. What is this document?

A This is the business signature card. This determines who has the ability to sign on the account.

Q And it also contains an agreement to open accounts?

A Yes, it does.

Q What entity is this for?

A Essential Consultants LLC.

Q And if you look at the bottom of the box that we are looking at, in the lower-most row, where it says "Type of Business," what type of business is listed?

A Consulting.

Q And is that business type something that's provided by the client in this case?

A Yes, it is.

Q And that's Mr. Cohen here?

A Yes. We asked for the purpose of the account and that was the answer.

Q Was the purpose for the account given in this form consistent with what Mr. Cohen told you on the phone call earlier that day?

A Yes, it is.

Q And is it consistent with the purpose of the account stated in the Know Your Customer form that we looked at on Friday?

A Yes, it is.

Q And if we scroll down a little bit to the middle portion of the page. Who is listed as the authorized signers for the account?

A Michael Cohen.

Q And any other authorized signers?

A No, there is not.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we turn to Page 4 of the PDF.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Is this another part of the same document that we just looked at?

A Yes. This is the signature page of that document.

Q Do you recognize the signature near the bottom of the page?

A Yes. It's Michael Cohen's.

Q And what's the date of that?

A 10/26/16.

Q And looking now at the box at the bottom of the page, is there an account number provided?

A Yes, there is.

Q And what are the last four digits of the account number?

A 1897.

Q And in the right-most column it says "open by."  Who is listed there?

A DeWitt Hutchins.

MS. MANGOLD: If we could flip to the following page, Page 5 of the PDF.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this document?

A Yes.

Q What is this?

A This is an addendum to the signature card. This kind of gives the information on the authorized signer.

Q And this is another required document to open a bank account?

A Yes, it is.

Q What is the account name listed at the top?

A Essential Consultants LLC.

Q And do you see a signature at the bottom?

A Yes. Michael Cohen's.

Q And what's the date?

A 10/26/16.

Q All right. Now, flipping through the last few pages of the PDF. Are Pages 6 through 9 of the PDF -- well, what are these documents?

A These are the opening of a LLC's accounts as well as the tax ID number provided by the Internal Revenue Service.

Q Are these documents generated at First Republic Bank or provided by the client?

A No, they are provided by the client. They are generated by the IRS.

Q And turning now to Page 6 of the PDF. What is this?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A This is -- the account was opened in Delaware, as most LLCs are that I do business with. And it's a Certificate of Formation of Essential Consultants.

Q And what is the date and time that Essential Consultants was formed?

A October 17th, 2016 at 10:21 a.m.

Q And just for -- in the interest of clarity, is this provided by the IRS or some other entity?

A My understanding is it's provided by -- the tax ID is provided by the IRS. And this is provided by the State of Delaware.

MS. MANGOLD: If we could flip to Page 7 of the PDF please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q What is this?

A This is the State of Delaware's Limited Liability Company formation doc, and it shows Michael Cohen as the authorized person.

MS. MANGOLD: And then, finally, flipping to -- if we can flip through Page 8 to Page 9 of the PDF; and focusing on the bottom of the page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Is this the document that you referenced earlier was issued by the IRS?

A Yes.

Q And this has an Employer Identification Number?

A Yes.

Q What is that?

A It's essentially -- to equate it to something, it's like the Social Security number for businesses. It's a tax ID for businesses.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we take that down. Now can we display to everyone what is admitted in evidence as People's 370.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Is this another set of First Republic Bank emails?

A Yes, it is.

Q Who is on these emails?

A Myself and DeWitt Hutchins.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the bottom portion of the page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Who is this email from?

A DeWitt to the myself.

Q What's the subject?

A "Michael Cohen."

Q And can you read the first line of the email, please?

A Sure. "Account is good to go - gave him wire instructions and ordered checks."

Q What did you understand "good to go" to mean?

A It means that it's open and ready to be funded.

Q And based on the date of the email and who it's from, do you know what account this is referencing?

A Essential Consultants LLC.

Q Now, looking at the date and time above, did DeWitt send this on the same day that you received the call from Mr. Cohen?

A Yes.

Q And you spoke to Mr. Cohen that morning about opening this account?

A That's correct.

Q What's the date stamp of this email?

A Oh, the date, excuse me, October 26th, 2016.

Q I'm sorry, the time stamp of the email?

A Okay. 2:35 p.m.

Q So about how long did it take to open the account between the time that Mr. Cohen called you and the time that Mr. Hutchins confirmed that the account was opened?

A Five to six hours or so.

Q Did Mr. Cohen indicate that opening this account was urgent when he called you?

A Yes. Michael Cohen -- everything was urgent with Michael Cohen.

Q So why did it take five or six hours to open the account?

A Michael Cohen's not our only client, so we do have other things that take precedence. Moving in and opening an account in a singular day is considered very quick.

Q Is that because there is some processes that the bank needs to undertake in order for the account to be opened?

A Absolutely.

Q And does that require certain checks by the back office, is -- I think you called it?

A Correct. As well as data entry, getting the paperwork back, et cetera.

Q So we've now looked at the account opening documents for Essential Consultants in some detail; right?

A Yes.

Q Probably more detail than anybody wanted.

A (Laughter.)

Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate the account would be used to make a payment on behalf of a political candidate?

A No.

Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated the account would be used to make a payment on behalf of a political candidate?

A There would be additional scrutiny.

Q And what do you mean by that?

A It would reach the second line of defense.

Q Would that have delayed the opening of the account?

A Quite possibly.

Q Is it possible that the account wouldn't have been opened at all?

A It's possible.

Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate that the account would be used to buy the rights to a media story?

A No.

Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the account would be used to buy the rights to a media story?

A Not necessarily, but we would certainly ask additional questions.

Q Was that consistent with the stated purpose of the account on the phone call to you, that it was for real estate?

A That would not be consistent with what it was, and that's why we would ask additional questions.

Q Did any of the account opening paperwork indicate the account would be used to pay an adult film star?

A No.

Q Would the bank's process for opening the account be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the account would be used to pay an adult film star?

A Absolutely.

Q How would it be different?

A Well, we would certainly ask additional questions. It's not our money to determine where it goes; however, it is an industry that we do not work with, so there would be a determination made by the second and third line of defense if it was something that we would move forward on.

Q And that would have delayed opening the account?

A That would certainly have delayed it.

Q And is it possible that the account wouldn't have been opened at all?

A Yes, it is.

Q All right. Looking back at this email from Mr. Hutchins. Can you read the bottom portion of the email?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A "Said he would swing by here in a little bit. Thanks."

Q Who did you understand "he" to be in that sentence?

A Michael Cohen.

Q And why would Mr. Cohen swing by the bank if the account was already opened?

A Because he needed to fund the account for it to be live.

Q He had to put money into the account for the account to actually be fully opened?

A That's correct.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we turn to what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit 372.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we focus on the bottom two emails on the page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Are these First Republic Bank emails?

A Yes.

Q Turning now to the bottom email on the page. Who is that from and to?

A Elizabeth Rappaport to Michael Cohen.

Q What is the subject of the email?

A The subject is "First Republic Bank Transfer."

Q And what is the date and time of this?

A October 26th, 2016 at 2:53 p.m.

Q And the last email that we saw was 2:35 that same day; is that correct?

A That's correct.

Q And so what was the approximate time between that last email and this email that was sent?

A Oh, 23 minutes.

Q Good math. Do you see something called "Importance" at the bottom of the top box of the email?

A Yes. It's of high importance.

Q And do you know what that is -- like, what that designation indicates?

A That something needs to be done quickly.

Q Can you read the body of the email to the jury?

A "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. Per our conversation over the phone, please confirm your request to transfer $131,000 from your home equity line of credit account number ending in 6194 to your checking account ending in 1897."

Q Is the account ending in 1897 the same account that was set up for Essential Consultants --

A Yes, it is.

Q -- that you discussed with us earlier?

A Yes, it is.

Q And when you say "home equity line of credit," is that also referred to as a HELOC?

A Yes, it is.

Q What is a HELOC?

A A home equity line of credit is a revolving mortgage that's put on your home. What I mean by "revolving" is essentially you can pay down on it at any time and repay it and then draw down on it again. It could be considered as a credit card, with your home as collateral. That's another good way to explain it.

Q Is it fair to say that it's mostly like a second mortgage?

A It is a second mortgage, but it can be put in first position as well. For clarification purposes, it is a mortgage that you are allowed to draw upon.

Q And, in this case, do you know if it was a second mortgage?

A It was a second mortgage in this scenario, yes.

Q Can you explain what's going on in this email?

A Sure. Obviously, a conversation was -- had taken place between Elizabeth and Michael where he had asked to drawdown on his home equity line of credit to fund the account at Essential Consultants.

Q What's the next email in the chain?

A It says "Confirmed."

Q Is that sent by Michael Cohen?

A That was sent by Michael Cohen to Lizzie.

Q And how long after the first email was that sent?

A One minute.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top email in the chain.

Q Who is this email to and from?

A This is from Elizabeth Rappaport to our Client Service Group.

Q And what is the date and time stamp of the top email?

A This is 10/26/2016, 11:56 a.m.

Q And can you explain, again, to the jury how the time stamps work in the First Republic email?

A Yes. The very top, when you are pulling the email system, is in Pacific Time. Everything below it is stuck in Eastern Standard Time.

Q And does this also have an importance designation?

A Yes, it does.

Q And what is it?

A "High."

Q Can you read this email to the jury?

A "Please transfer $131,000 from HELOC account ending in 6194 to checking account ending in 1897. Please note this is a time-sensitive request. Please confirm once complete."

Q When Ms. Rappaport says "it's a time-sensitive request," is that something that would come from Ms. Rappaport or from the client?

A In this scenario, it could be from either. And the reason why I say that is because this is now 2:56 p.m. and the wire cut off time is 3:00 p.m., so my assumption would be it started with -- with Michael saying it's urgent, because he did in a prior email; however, that would be purely an assumption.

Q And when you say "the wire cut off," what does that mean?

A At 3:00 p.m. is when the wires have to be sent out to be received same day.

Q Would that impact this HELOC transfer?

A Well, if the HELOC transfer is not done, the wire cannot be done.

Q Is that reference to a subsequent wire after the transfer from the HELOC?

A Well, a transfer from a HELOC is not a wire so it's a bank transfer; so it transfers over and then the wire would be the secondary move that went to someone else.

Q So was it your understanding that after this account was funded, Mr. Cohen wanted to subsequently send a wire transfer out using that account --

A That's correct.

Q -- later that day?

A That's correct.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at People's Exhibit 373, which is already in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this?

A I do.

Q What is this?

A This is an advance request for a line of credit.

Q Do you know what this advance request was for?

A This was for the home equity line.

Q That's Mr. Cohen's home equity line?

A That's correct.

Q Looking now at the top half of the page?

A Uh-huh.

Q What is the request type?

A Is "advance."

Q That means he is borrowing money?

A That means he's drawing down on the line of credit, yes.

Q What is the amount?

A $131,000.

Q And who is the borrower?

A The borrower is Michael Cohen or Laura Cohen.

Q Do you know who Laura Cohen is?

A Michael's spouse.

Q And why are both of their names listed?

A Both of their names are listed on the home equity line of credit.

Q And where is this transfer from and to?

A It is from the line of credit and ending in 6194, and it's being credited to the new account for Essential Consultants ending in 1897.

Q And looking at the effective date on the right, is that the same date that Michael Cohen called you to open the account?

A Yes, 10/26/16.

MS. MANGOLD: And can we look at the bottom half of the page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Does this indicate that this transfer had to be approved by people at First Republic Bank?

A Yes.

Q And how many people at First Republic Bank had to approve this?

A In this scenario, two.

Q And those are their names listed there?

A Yes, Melissa Duran and Mark Stewart.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we please take a look at People's Exhibit 374 already in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q What is this?

A This is an email from Melissa Duran to the Loan Servicing Department requesting the advance.

Q I'm sorry, the Loan Servicing Department is part of First Republic Bank?

A Part of our back office operations, yes.

Q And that's different from the Client Service Group?

A Yes, it is.

Q What is the subject?

A The subject is "Advance 6194, OSI. Please expedite pending wire."

Q And is there an importance designation in this email?

A Yes. "High."

Q Can you read this email to the jury?

A "My client Michael Cohen or Laura Cohen is requesting an advance in the amount of $131,000. Please expedite pending wire. Thank you. Melissa Duran."

Q And can you explain what's going on in this email?

A Yes. So an advance has to be done by our Loan Servicing Department. It's another part of our checks and balances. So it goes to the Loan Servicing from our Client Service Group to drawdown and make the deposit.

Q All right. And this is the internal bank communication to get that done?

A Yes, it is.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we now take a look at People's Exhibit 375 already in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Take a look at the bottom two emails on this page. Are these First Republic Bank emails?

A Yes, they are.

Q Looking at the bottom-most email on the page. Is this an email that we've already seen?

A Yes, it is.

Q What's this email at the bottom?

A Pardon me?

Q What is the email at the bottom?

A Oh, this is the requesting the transfer and the drawdown on the HELOC account and then depositing it into the Essential Consultants account.

Q Now, looking at the next email in the chain. Who is this to and from?

A It's from Michael Cohen to Elizabeth Rappaport.

Q Can you read this email?

A "Can you please send me confirmation that the funds were deposited into the other account?  Important."

Q And do you have an understanding of what this means?

A Yes. This is stating that he's asking if the $131,000 was deposited into Essential Consultants.

Q Did he explain to you why this was important?

A He did not explain to me directly why this was important. I did not speak to him after that initial call.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top email on the page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Who is this to and from?

A From Elizabeth Rappaport to Michael Cohen.

Q And what's the date and time?

A The date is 10/26/2016 at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time.

Q That's 4:15 Eastern?

A Yes, it is.

Q Can you read the email to the jury?

A "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. The funds have been deposited into your account ending in 1897."

Q And what does that mean?

A That means that the drawdown on the home equity line of credit has been completed and it has been deposited into the now Essential Consultants account that was established that day.

Q Does that mean the Essential Consultants account is now fully funded?

A Fully funded and live for business.

Q Officially open?

A Yes.

Q All right. Now, let's take a look at what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit 376.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this document?

A Yes, I do.

Q What type of document is this?

A This is a Wire Authorization form.

Q What is a Wire Authorization form?

A This gives us the right to send the wire when we are in person with the client.

Q And just in case there is anybody who doesn't know what a wire is, what is a wire?

A A wire is an electronic way of moving funds from one party to another party.

Q Focusing now on the top half of the page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you see where the wire transfer is coming from?

A Are you talking about -- who the originator is of the wire?

Q Yes.

A It's Essential Consultants LLC.

Q And on the top right-hand side of the page does it say who prepared this Wire Transfer Authorization Agreement form?

A Yes. DeWitt Hutchins.

Q DeWitt Hutchins. Would he fill that out with input from the originator?

A Yes.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look now at the bottom box on the page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you tell when this Wire Authorization form was filled out?

A Yes. 10/27/2016 at 10:01 a.m.

Q And can you tell whether the client did this remotely or at the bank?

A He did it in person.

Q Is that indicated there on the left?

A Yes.

Q And do you recognize the signature or initials in this box?

A Which box?

Q Below the date and time stamp. I'm sorry.

A Yeah, that is DeWitt Hutchins's signature.

Q So is this then the following morning after the account had been opened?

A This is the following morning, yes.

Q All right. Let's go back to the top of the page. Can you see the amount of the wire transfer here?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

A $130,000.

Q And can you see the last four digits of the Essential Consultants account where the wire would be coming from?

A 1897.

Q And is that the same account that was just opened the prior day?

A Yes, it is.

Q Now, looking at the middle portion of the page. The font is very small, but can you see what's listed in the beneficiary line of the form?

A Yes, I can. It's Keith M. Davidson and Associates PLC Attorney Client Trust Account.

Q Do you know what an Attorney Client Trust Account is?

A It's an account that's held by attorneys on behalf of one of their clients.

Q So not going to the attorney directly, it's being held for somebody that they represent?

A That's correct.

Q And if you look at the section called "F. Purpose of Wire Being Sent," what does it say there?

A It says "Retainer."

Q Why does the bank ask for the purpose of the wire being sent?

A To ensure that we're not doing anything that would be outside of the scope that we would want to do.

Q And who provides the information here?

A That's provided by the client.

Q And who is that in this case?

A Michael Cohen.

Q Do you know what a retainer is?

A A retainer is money that is given to another individual in advance of business that -- or work that is to be done.

Q And is a wire for a retainer to an attorney for the attorney's client consistent with the stated purpose of the account for real estate consulting?

A It certainly could be, yes.

Q And can you elaborate on that a little bit more?

A I could only make suggestions on what it could be for; however, a retainer could be held for individuals who are doing appraisals for other parts of the business, doing an analysis on a cash flow statement if it's a multi-family business. There could be a number of things why a retainer would be given from one attorney to another for a real estate transaction.

Q And you are basing that from your experience with working with real estate clients?

A Yes, for over 20 years.

Q Now, looking at the portion just below this on the form, below the double line. Do you see that fine print above the signature line?

A I do.

Q What does the first sentence of that say?

A "I/we certify that the information contained herein is true, complete and accurate."

Q And do you recognize the signature?

A Yes. "Michael Cohen."

Q And what's the date?

A 10/27/2016.

Q Are there two more signatures below that?

A Yes.

Q Do you know who those signatures are from?

A Yes. DeWitt Hutchins and Andrea Wang.

Q And are both DeWitt Hutchins and Andrea Wang First Republic Bank personnel?

A Yes. They both worked in the same office.

Q And does this indicate that multiple people from the bank had to approve this wire before it was sent out?

A Yes. Wire approval requires certain levels. Each person has a level of allowance, if you will, on what they are allowed to do as a singular signer; and given that it is over $100,000, it requires two signatures.

Q Now, turning to Page 3 of the same PDF.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you know what this is?

A Looks like wire instructions that were provided by Davidson and Associates.

Q And who was Davidson and Associates for the purposes of this wire transfer?

A He was the beneficiary of the wire that was being sent by Michael Cohen.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Let's take a look now at what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit 377.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Do you recognize this document?

A I do.

Q What kind of document is this?

A This is an Outgoing Wire Transfer form. It's an internal document.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the top half of the page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Now, what stage in the wire transfer did the bank fill out this form?

A This form is when it's physically input into the system, this is what comes out.

Q Is this confirmation that the wire transfer has already gone out?

A I do not see a number on it; however, this is if -- that it has been input. The confirmation would be something different.

Q Okay. What is the date and time of this form?

A This is 7:20 a.m., but that's Pacific Time, so it's 10:20 a.m. And it's on 10/27/2016.

Q And looking now at the amount and customer name at the top, is this the same wire that we just looked at from Essential Consultants?

A Yes, it appears that way.

Q And do you see --

MS. MANGOLD: If we could zoom out.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q There is handwriting on the right side of the page. Do you know what that handwriting is?

A It looks like it has been initialed by Andrea Wang.

Q And that's somebody, again, who works at the bank?

A Yes.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Let's turn now to what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit 378.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you describe what this is?

A This is an email from DeWitt Hutchins to Michael Cohen with the confirmation that the wire has been executed and is on its way.

Q And based on the time stamp and who the email is to and from what wires, what do you understand this to be a reference to?

A This is the reference to the wire that was being sent to Davidson and Associates.

Q And what date and time -- is there a confirmation of the wire that went out?

A 10/27/2016 at 10:50 a.m. Eastern Time; 7:50 a.m. Pacific Time.

Q All right.

MS. MANGOLD: Lastly, can we look at People's Exhibit 379 already in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q What type of document is this?

A This is a banking account statement.

Q And is it a banking account statement from First Republic Bank?

A Yes.

Q Can you look at the top portion of the page, please. What account is this an account statement for?

A Essential Consultants LLC.

Q And what are the last four digits of the account number?

A 1897.

Q Now, if you look above that, there is a portion called "Statement Period." What are the dates of the statement period?

A October 26th, 2016 to October 31st, 2016.

Q Is it typical to have a statement period that's only five days?

A No, it's usually a 30-day statement.

Q Do you know why this is five days?

A Because the cut-off period is -- we would issue a statement regardless of what day you opened it during the month to maintain the schedule of you receiving it the first of every month.

Q So did the account exist before October 26th, 2016?

A No. That's why it started on October 26th.

MS. MANGOLD: Can we look at the bottom two-thirds of the page, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q Can you explain what is described under "Account Activity?"

A Yes. So you will have the deposits and credits and withdrawals and debits. The first being a deposit from the credit on an advance on the home equity line of credit on 6194 for $131,000. And then on the bottom, a domestic wire transfer to Keith M. Davidson and Associates for $130,000. And then a $35 fee for that transaction.

Q And then the date to the left of that $131,000 credit is the same date that Mr. Cohen called you to open the account; right?

A That's correct.

Q And the wire out is on the subsequent day?

A That's correct.

Q So did all of the Essential Consultants transactions that we just looked at take place in that approximately 24-hour period?

A Yes, it did.

Q And that includes opening the account, funding the account with the HELOC, and transferring the wire to Mr. Davidson; right?

A In fact, it starts from an initial phone call to open the account, to funding the account, to the wiring out the money.

Q Now, is that timing typical for a real estate transaction?

A It's not atypical. Wires -- you know, real estate transactions for people who own significant amounts of real estate, they like to move very quickly because, opportunistically, it locks it up and that way they can avoid getting other bids; or quickly getting into attorney review, which, essentially, would take it off the market.

Q Having now looked at the wire transfer paperwork for the amount, timing and description of the wire, are they all consistent with using this account and sending that wire as a real estate transaction?

A Yes.

Q And that had to be approved by the bank?

A All wires have to be approved by the bank.

Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that money was being transferred on behalf of a political candidate?

A No.

Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire transfer be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the money was being transferred on behalf of a political candidate?

A We would have additional due diligence.

Q Would that have delayed the transaction?

A It certainly could.

Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that money was being transferred to buy the rights to a media story?

A No.

Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the payment was being made to buy the rights to a media story?

A Possibly, yeah.

Q Could that have delayed the transaction?

A It would have because additional questions would have been asked at that time.

Q Did any of the wire transfer paperwork indicate that money was being transferred for the payment to an adult film star?

A It did not.

Q Would the bank's process for approving the wire be different if Mr. Cohen had indicated that the wire transfer was a payment to an adult film star?

A Yes, there would definitely be enhanced due diligence on that.

Q By "enhanced due diligence," you mean further checks by the bank?

A Correct.

Q Would that have delayed the transaction?

A It certainly would have.

Q Is it possible that the wire wouldn't have been approved at all by the bank?

A Yes. If we -- if it was something like that, we might be -- that our reputation is at risk, and we might not have wanted to send the wire.

MS. MANGOLD: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Thank you. Any cross?

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you, your Honor.

CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q Good morning. How are you?

A Good morning, sir.

Q You -- my name is Todd Blanche. You and I have never met; correct?

A We have not.

Q And you testified on Friday, I believe, that you are here pursuant to a subpoena from the People, but you initially were cooperative and had no reason to not be cooperative with the People; correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you and I have never met before, but you met with the People on several occasions before you testified on Friday and today; correct?

A Please explain what "the People" means?

Q I'm sorry. The folks at this table. Maybe they are not at this table, but folks that worked at the Manhattan District Attorney's office?

A Yes, sir.

Q Approximately how many occasions did you meet with the Manhattan District Attorney's office?

A Twice.

Q When were those occasions?

A Over the last month or two. I don't know the exact dates.

Q So, recently, you met with them twice. But you also met with them last year; didn't you?

A I did not meet with the same people last year.

Q Did you meet with other folks who worked for the Manhattan District Attorney's office last year?

A I did.

Q And even if it wasn't the same people that you met with over the past two months, on how many occasions last year did you meet with the Manhattan District Attorney's office?

A I believe it was one time.

Q Aside from the times you just testified about, so a couple of times this year, one time last year, did you meet with any other law enforcement about the subject of your testimony today?

A Yes, I did.

Q Who?

A The -- I was in Washington to discuss the same matter.

Q In Washington D.C.?

A Correct.

Q And when was that?

A I believe this -- and I could be wrong on the date, it's 2018, '19.

Q And in 2018, '19, on how many occasions did you go to D.C. to meet with the prosecutors?

A I believe it was twice.

Q The same trip or two separate occasions?

A No, two separate occasions.

Q During all of the times that you just talked about, so D.C. on two separate occasions, last year a couple of times -- I'm sorry, last year one time and then this year a couple of times, you were represented by counsel; correct?

A Yes, I was.

Q And you are not paying for your own lawyers; right?

A I am not.

Q Who is paying for your lawyers, Chase?

A Well, when I went to D.C., it was paid by First Republic. And when -- now it's being paid by Flagstone, my new institution.

Q So when -- but Chase took over First Republic after the collapse, I believe you testified; correct?

A That's correct.

Q So prior to the collapse, First Republic was paying for your lawyers?

A That's correct.

Q And that's because this is completely about your professional job; correct?

A Is it what completely about?

Q That's because the reason why you are testifying has to do with your professional job, nothing to do with anything personal; correct?

A That's correct.

Q So just to remind everybody, because we had a long weekend, you were at First Republic Bank from 2008 until March of last year, 2023; correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you were promoted along the way, eventually becoming a Senior Managing Director?

A I was promoted even further than that after that, yes.

Q So what were you promoted to after Senior Managing Director?

A Executive Managing Director.

Q So when you left last year, you were Executive Managing Director?

A That's correct, yes.

Q And when you were assigned the Michael Cohen relationship in 2015, at that point you were a Senior Managing Director already?

A Yes.

Q And you didn't do account opening for Mr. Cohen, he was already a First Republic client; correct?

A I didn't do account opening for anyone. I provided advice to clients. I don't do the actual, physical paperwork.

Q But whenever Mr. Cohen was onboarded at First Republic, you were not part of that process?

A Not part of the paperwork process. I would have conversations about the types of accounts and provide advice, but not necessarily on the account opening paperwork.

Q Do you know how long Mr. Cohen had been a First Republic client before you took over the relationship with him?

A I recall 2012 being a possibility of when he established a relationship initially, but I could be wrong.

MR. BLANCHE: Can we put up what has already been admitted in evidence as People's Exhibit 368, so everybody can take a look at that.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q If you -- this is one of the documents that you looked at last week. If we look at, towards the bottom of this document, there is a series of questions at the bottom right. If you see, it says, "Referral source's length of relationship with the bank." And it says, "five years?" And then if we could look at the top of that same document, I believe this document was updated in October of 2016. Do you see that?

A Yes, so that would be 2011.

Q All right. 2011. And, by the way, you have no reason to believe that there is anything inaccurate about that, it's about five years?

A No.

Q And so, again, you testified on Friday that when you were given the Mr. Cohen assignment, you were told that Mr. Cohen could be -- was difficult; is that fair?

A Yes. He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly.

Q Do you remember the first time you spoke with Mr. Cohen?

A I do.

Q Can you tell us about that?

A Yes. I -- excuse me, pardon me for a second.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Pause.

A I was brought to Michael Cohen's office with my boss at the time for an introduction.

Q And that's the office at the Trump Tower?

A That's correct.

Q So the initial communication with him was in person, but I believe over the course of the relationship, did you mostly talk on the phone with him?

A Yes.

Q Or meet him in person?

A It was mostly over the phone.

Q That would be not frequently, a few times a year; is that fair?

A Yeah, it was an infrequent thing, you know, it would maybe be three, four times a year.

Q And the types of conversations you would have with him had to do with, for example, opening a new account or having a fee waived or something, some general type of work like that; is that fair?

A Yes, that's correct.

Q You testified that he did a lot of his own business and one of the reasons was because there was actually a branch right across from Trump Tower; is that right?

A Within a short walking distance, yes.

Q And folks there, the Client Services team could handle most of the stuff that Mr. Cohen needed; right?

A That's correct.

Q Now, you testified that every time you spoke -- well, that when you spoke with Michael Cohen, everything was urgent; is that a fair way to describe it?

A So 90 percent of the time it was an urgent matter, yes.

Q You -- is it true that when you first were assigned Mr. Cohen, your leadership team told you that you were picked to take over the relationship because you were firm with clients?

A Yes.

Q And that you don't accept any nonsense from clients; correct?

A Well, not that I don't accept any nonsense, it's just that I, I try to rationalize with clients that things -- that certain things aren't as urgent as they may seem.

Q And Mr. Cohen, I believe you said, you believe he's an aggressive guy. He's a fast speaker, someone who is not the easiest guy to work with if you are not familiar with him; is that a fair way to describe it?

A I would say so, yes.

Q And, at least, as of March last year, so March of 2023, Mr. Cohen was still your client, this is before you left First Republic; correct?

A That is not correct.

Q That's not correct; why not?

A No. Once this information came out and was publicized in the paper, I was taken away from the relationship.

MR. BLANCHE: Can we show the Court, the People and the witness D10, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

MR. BLANCHE: I'm sorry. Not up at the top. Thank you.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Shown to just the witness, all counsel and the Court.

Q So do you recall meeting -- I think you talked about not with the prosecutors at this table, but with different prosecutors at the Manhattan District Attorney's office on March 6th of last year?

A Do I remember speaking to -- yes.

Q And if you could just take a look at the first line of that, of what's marked for identification as D10.

A Uh-huh.

Q Can you see if that refreshes your recollection that you told the District Attorney that, unfortunately, Mr. Cohen was still your client?

A What was -- this is 2016. You just asked me about 2023.

Q So in 2023, when you met with the District Attorney, he was not your client?

A In 2023 he was not -- no longer my client.

Q Do you remember the -- so when was he taken away?  When was he no longer your client?

A 2017, at some point, once this information went public.

Q So when you say when "this information went public," at some point when something came out about, in part, the transaction that you testified about on direct --

A That's right.

Q -- you were no longer responsible for that relationship?

A They didn't want me to have communication with the client any longer.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Susan Pearce-Bates relieved Senior Court Reporter Lisa Kramsky.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Continued from the previous page.

Q But is it your understanding, and I believe you testified to this on Friday, that if a client has a mortgage with the bank, even if the bank decides to no longer have other business with him, the mortgage will often remain, correct?

A That is correct.

Q Is that true with Mr. Cohen, as far as you know?

A Yes.

Q Maybe, this is what you were just talking about. Are you familiar with the term de-risk?

A I am not familiar with that term, no.

Q When a bank determines that there is something about a client, or the type of accounts the client wants to have with the banks, they can decide -- the bank can decide to no longer do business with them, correct?

A That's correct.

Q And you testified last week, and a little bit today, that there are any number of types of work or types of clients that First Republic may decide they don't want to do work with, right?

A That's correct.

Q It could be the client himself or herself, correct?

A Yes.

Q It could be the type of business that client is in, correct?

A That's correct.

Q It could be the types of transactions that are coming through the accounts, incoming, outgoing, depending on the circumstances, correct?

A A hundred percent.

Q And do you know whether that type of analysis was done on Mr. Cohen between the time he started at the bank and 2016?

A I do not know if that analysis was done, no.

Q Is it fair to say that you testified on Friday and today about the KYC documents that Mr. Cohen completed with respect to two LLCs at least, right?

A Yes.

Q And isn't that KYC process designed, at least in part, to identify red flags or identify what we were just talking about, something about the customer or something about the business or something about the account, that maybe would make the bank decide they didn't want to do business?

A Yes, it wouldn't indicate transaction.

Q Say that again.

A It just wouldn't indicate transaction activity to be referenced.

Q Understood. Now, if we can pull up what's already in evidence as People's Exhibit 368, and this can be shown to everybody. This is something that you testified about on Friday, I believe. This is a KYC form for Essential Consultants, correct?

A Yes, it is.

Q And you didn't complete this with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Hutchins did, is that right?

A That's right.

Q And you -- what was your business relationship with Mr. Hutchins?

A He worked in one of the offices. So, at times he would service my clientele.

Q Was there something unique between your relationship with Mr. Hutchins, or did you have folks like Mr. Hutchins all over?

A I had folks like Mr. Hutchins at all of the offices.

Q Is it because of his location near Trump Tower that Mr. Hutchins was involved in the Michael Cohen relationship?

A Yes.

Q And if we can look at page two of this document, please. There is a narrative, a business narrative, that's discussed. If we can just blow that up. And it says, Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment consulting work he does in real estate deals. Do you see that?

A Yes.

Q Do you remember at the time having any concerns about Mr. Cohen's description of this business narrative?

A No, it seemed consistent with what he did on his own activity.

Q And to be clear, the work that Mr. Cohen is describing as a consultant would be separate from the work he was doing, for whatever he was doing, for the Trump Organization, correct?

A Yes.

Q Right. Like, President Donald Trump didn't bank with First Republic, as far as you know, right?

A I wouldn't know. We can only see the clients we do business with.

Q He did not do business with you?

A Correct.

Q And Mr. Cohen, who did do business with you, never told you that a deal he was doing, he was doing with Donald J. Trump or the Trump Organization; that would be separate, correct?

A Yes, it would.

Q Indeed, if he had said, this is a deal I am doing with my employer, you may have asked questions?

A I would have asked questions.

Q And that didn't happen?

A That did not happen.

Q But you understood at the time as you testified, I believe, that Mr. Cohen did do work, real estate work at least, and consulting work that was separate and apart from his job at the Trump Organization, correct?

A That's correct.

Q And, by the way, your basis for knowing that is Mr. Cohen, correct?

A Yes.

Q What I mean by that, you don't go out and do an internal investigation of Mr. Cohen's real estate deals; he tells you and you accept it, correct?

A Yes.

Q And there is nothing wrong with you doing that?

A I couldn't infringe upon and ask any further questions on that.

Q I think you testified you had 1800 clients, is that right, over the time?

A Approximately, yes.

Q Now, I want to focus a little bit more on October 2016, which you testified about Friday and again this morning. You recall having several phone calls with Mr. Cohen in those few weeks in October 2016?

A Thirteen to 26, yes.

Q And that's different from your relationship with him the rest of the time?

A Yes.

Q So the initial LLC was never funded, never opened, Resolution Consultants, correct?

A That's correct.

Q Do you know why?

A I have no idea why.

Q Does it matter why?

A It doesn't matter.

Q Meaning, if a client comes to you and says, I have a new LLC, and I want to open an account, and they complete the KYC, but, ultimately, the account never opens, that doesn't alert you? That doesn't raise, necessarily, a red flag, does it?

A It's not a red flag.

Q And then, as you testified today, a week or so later in October of 2016, Mr. Cohen called you and said he wanted to open an account. Was that the day that you were golfing?

A Yes, it was, sir.

Q We are all jealous. And so, but that didn't really matter because you can go across the street and do everything you would have done on the phone?

A That's correct.

Q And you have a team, Ms. Rappaport and you had folks there helping you make things happen?

A I have several team members, yes.

Q And, again, if we can put up Exhibit, already in evidence, 371, if we can go to the second page first, and then the next page. This is, again, the various documentation associated with the LLC that ultimately was founded, correct?

A That's correct.

Q And on page two, there are some questions about whether, I believe, standard questions about whether he is acting as an agent for anybody. And Mr. Cohen answered, no, to that, right?

A That's correct.

Q And if he had answered, yes, that would have potentially raised more questions?

A Well, not only would it raise more questions, it would require more paperwork.

Q What type of paperwork?

A We would have to know. We would have to determine exactly who he was acting as agent for.

Q And by, know, just have him tell you, or would there have to be --

A No.

Q -- proof, documentation?

A Documentation.

Q So, it's not just a conversation. It is, actually, collecting additional documentation from Mr. Cohen and the agent?

A We would have to ensure that he is not working with a person of interest.

Q And you testified on Friday about -- the prosecutors asked you about what your understanding of a shell corporation is. Do you remember those questions?

A I do.

Q And I believe you testified that it is an entity that's opened up to receive monies and send out wires and doesn't have an actual business behind it?

A Yes.

Q Correct?

A Yes.

Q You have no reason to believe, or you didn't at the time, that Mr. Cohen was opening up this LLC to be a shell corporation, did you?

A I don't open up shell corporations. I open up LLC accounts that have operating businesses. And if a client had told me that this would be a shell corporation, the account would not have been opened.

Q Why is that?

A Because it's -- shell corporations that have no business behind them would give me pause. Very frankly, I would want to understand what the purpose of simply opening an account to simply send out wires would be.

Q So, your expectation from your client is that when they open an account, whether it be a LLC or otherwise, it would not be a shell corporation, it would be something in business?

A There would only be one purpose that I would open up an account that had very little activity on it, and that would be LLC ownership of a home or a yacht or aircraft or something along those lines. And the purpose of that ownership would be to remain anonymous, simply because any type of mortgage on that document or a mortgage taken against that becomes a public record.

Q But an LLC could also be for a business, correct?

A They are commonly used for businesses.

Q So, if Mr. Cohen says he is opening a consulting business or a law firm, that wouldn't raise any red flags to you either?

A Not at all.

Q And, indeed, that's what he said he was doing, correct?

A That's correct.

Q Did you -- so, if we can put up Exhibit 366, which is already in evidence, and I would like to turn to paragraph eight, the first page, so we can see it. So, you were shown this document on Friday, and then if we can turn to page eight with the Bates number ending 94230. And then if we can just blow up the middle, please. You were asked a question on Friday, and then you were asked a series of questions today about the boxes that were checked on forms like this, both this one, and then also the one that was later completed for the other LLC. And you were asked about question 12, is this entity associated with political fundraising, Political Action Committees, PACs, and the box is checked no, right? Do you remember those questions?

A I do.

Q So there is a series of other questions that we are looking at on the screen now, all of which say, no, for each of those questions, including the highlighted one. If the answer is, yes, it doesn't mean the LLC won't be opened, does it?

A It does not.

Q It just means that there is going to be some sort of follow-up question from you or from your Compliance Department or something like that, correct?

A That's correct. But I do want to clarify one thing, if I may.

Q Yes, please, sir.

A If the box is checked, yes, referring to, Persons/Entities Found on the OFAC/SDN List, that would be a hard no.

Q Can you -- can you just indicate what you are referring to, sir?

A Underneath 16A, to the right, you will see, on the OFAC/SDN list. I would like to be concise. If they were on the OFAC list, we would not open that account. That would be totally non-optional.

Q Understood. So there are some boxes that could be checked and would likely be fatal to the LLC opening an account with your bank?

A Yes.

Q Fair. That makes sense. You were asked questions this morning about whether you would have had a different reaction to the accounts if you had known, or if you were told that the account was going to be used for some sort of political activity or political fundraising, correct?

A Correct.

Q You weren't told that, were you?

A No, I was not.

Q As far as you knew, at the time from your communications with your team that were communicating with Mr. Cohen, and from Mr. Cohen himself, that wasn't the purpose of this LLC?

A That's not what he told me or my team.

Q Do you recall -- I want to move forward a little bit to 2017.

A Okay.

Q Do you recall on March 2, 2017, that you emailed Mr. Cohen at his Trump Organization email address and received a bounce-back saying, as of January 20th, Mr. Cohen had accepted the role as personal counsel to President Donald J. Trump?  Do you recall that?

A I do recall that, yes.

Q Was that email bounce-back on March 17, 2017, the first time you learned that Mr. Cohen had left the Trump Organization to be President Trump's personal lawyer?

A No, it, actually, was sent errantly.

Q Say that again.

A That email was sent errantly.

Q Putting aside the reason for why the email was sent, my question to you was, when you received the bounce back, was that the first time you learned that Mr. Cohen had left the Trump Organization?

A Oh, yes, sir.

Q So, up until -- so between -- well, up until March 21st of 2017, you didn't know anything about whether Mr. Cohen was still at the Trump Organization or where he was working?

A No.

Q And then, do you recall a series of communications and emails a little bit later in 2017, in March and April, when a new account was being opened for Mr. Cohen's new law firm?

A I do not recall that.

Q If we can just show, and not to the jury, but just to the witness, the Court and the People and us, D13.

A Okay.

Q If you can take a look at D13, and take your time. It is a couple --

A This refreshes my memory.

Q So, does that refresh your recollection that around the same time as that errant email was sent --

A Yes.

Q -- you opened an account, or you and your team, opened an account for Mr. Cohen and his new law firm?

A Yes.

Q And I know your memory has just been refreshed, but do you recall, now that it has been refreshed, having any concerns at any time about this new account being opened by Mr. Cohen?

A No, he is a lawyer opening a new law firm account.

Q Now, are you familiar with the term PEP?

A Politically Exposed Person.

Q Yes. Can you tell the jury -- are you familiar with that term?

A I am.

Q Can you tell the jury what a Politically Exposed Person, a PEP, is?

A It's someone who has either held office, is in office or is related to, or very close to, someone in office.

Q When you say, in office, are there different types of PEPs, international and domestic?

A Yes, there is.

Q So, when you were just talking about someone who held office, do you mean a domestic PEP is someone elected to serve as a Congressman, Senator, State Senator, President of the United States, that sort of thing?

A Yes.

Q Now, as -- if Mr. Cohen is a personal attorney to President Donald Trump in 2017, in your view, would that make him a PEP?

A As the attorney for him, I would not consider that a PEP.

Q So, are you aware that the definition of a PEP, domestic PEP, includes any close associates or any individual publicly known or known by the financial institution to be a close, personal, professional associate?

A I was not aware of that.

Q Now, if you had been aware, or if you had considered that, what's the process, or what was the process when you were working there to identify or look into whether somebody should be identified as a PEP by the bank?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.

A That would bring it up to the second level, BSA/AML.

Q So, the BSA/AML, the second layer that you testified about on Friday, the Compliance Department, would presumably ask questions of you or ask questions of the client?

A They will -- well, they would ask both. They wouldn't go directly to the client. They would come through me, typically. But in some cases they would speak directly to the client to understand how deep of a relationship it is and if that could, potentially, put us at risk in any way.

Q Have you, to the best of your knowledge, ever had a client who was a PEP?

A I have.

Q So what types of safeguards or traps are put around an account or relationship of a PEP?

A The accounts are monitored pretty closely to ensure that activity is not going in any way that would put us at risk.

Q Is the monitoring -- can you explain to the jury what you mean by that?

A Transaction activity monitoring, limits are done on all accounts, but there would be an added layer on this.

Q So, algorithms and whatnot that are behind the scenes, and also, of course, the limits of the first line of defense as well?

A As well as a second line of defense. We would continue to monitor that account.

Q Do you recall an email from Mr. Cohen to you, again, we are moving a little further along to September of 2017, saying, on September 1st, where he said that he needed to speak with you, important, asking when you are free?

A September 30th?

Q September 1, 2017?

A I do not.

Q Do you have any idea, as you sit here today, whether you spoke with him on that day?

A I do not recall.

Q And you don't recall then, I assume, what any conversation was about?

A No.

Q Do you recall any communications with Mr. Cohen besides what you testified today about in March 2017? Since March, April, 2017, do you recall any other conversations with Mr. Cohen?

A No.

Q You testified earlier today about the HELOC and the money moving into Mr. Cohen's account, opening the account and it all happening pretty quickly, correct?

A Yes.

Q And I believe you testified that for real estate transactions that's not necessarily unusual?

A It's not unusual. It's not every time, but it's not unusual.

Q But it is not just real estate transactions, right, that would also be true of other types of contracts, such as purchasing a yacht which you testified?

A A yacht, an aircraft, for -- there are many different reasons why clients came to us and why they work with us is our ability to execute transactions quickly.

Q Correct. But I am focused more on the speed and the way that this happened with Mr. Cohen where he calls you, you send him to Mr. Hutchins, and literally within a day, the account is opened, the account is funded and a wire going out. My question is that, that could be the case for all kinds of contractual transactions between your client and another party, correct?

A Correct.

Q And the safeguards you testified about today, asking the client why the wire is going to be sent, and from the paperwork it looks like Mr. Cohen says, retainer?

A It says, retainer. It is domestic as well so that's what makes it easier to do.

Q The location that the wire is being sent, so in this case, to a law firm, correct, that would also be something that you would look at?

A Yes, I mean, it happens a thousand times a day.

Q And my point is this, my point is, at the time, in October 2016, nothing about the way this account was opened, funded or the wire that was sent out, at the time, raised any red flags to you, correct?

A Not based upon the answers that I was given for the questions I asked.

Q And similarly to your team, if one of them had a red flag from -- if Ms. Rappaport had a concern from her communications with Mr. Cohen, she would have raised that to you?

A That would have been brought to my attention and the process would have been delayed.

Q And that did not happen?

A That did not happen.

MR. BLANCHE: Can I just have one moment, your Honor?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, defense counsel confer.

BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q And I think we talked a little bit about this earlier, about Mr. Cohen's relationship working for the Trump Organization and his relationship with you. You never had any communications with him about Donald Trump himself, did you?

A I did not.

Q And you have never spoken with Donald Trump yourself, have you?

A I have not.

MR. BLANCHE: No more questions, your Honor.

THE COURT: Any redirect?

MS. MANGOLD: Just a little bit, your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. MANGOLD:

Q Now, Mr. Farro, you just testified that at a certain point the bank took away the client relationship from you and that Mr. Cohen's accounts were largely closed at First Republic Bank, is that correct?

A The accounts that we could close were closed, yes.

Q Can you describe the circumstances of that to the jury?

A Yes, when -- we have the optionality to close the account at any time we chose not to be attached to what we consider to be negative press. When we saw negative press, we chose to close the accounts which we could, which are the operational bank accounts. We cannot close out a mortgage, simply because you can't expect the client to pay it off in full. So, we maintained the mortgage accounts and closed out the bank accounts.

Q And what is the negative press you are referring to here?

A The Stormy Daniels, the one that came out.

Q And was that the first time that the bank learned the true nature of those transactions that we discussed?

A Yes.

MR. BLANCHE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q Was Mr. Cohen's accounts, other than his mortgage account, closed because the bank learned of the true nature of those transactions?

A Well, once the client does not be completely honest with us, we choose not to do business with them going forward.

MS. MANGOLD: No further questions.

THE COURT: Anything else, Mr. Blanche?

MR. BLANCHE: Just very brief.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLANCHE:

Q So, just to understand, were you part of the decision to close the accounts that could be closed with Mr. Cohen?

A I don't make those decisions.

Q No, you were not part of those decisions?

A No.

Q You were informed that the decision was made?

A Yes.

Q And you -- do you have any reason to believe that when that decision was made, it had anything to do with anything other than the public pressure reports about what you just testified?

A That was my understanding.

Q And, if true -- and, by the way, you have no personal knowledge of whether it is true or not, do you?

A No.

Q If true, that would have meant, potentially, that there wasn't appropriate due diligence done by the bank at the time, right?

MS. MANGOLD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A I don't know if that's a fair statement.

Q Well --

A Due diligence is done prior to an account being opened. After a transaction happens, it goes from one lawyer to another lawyer. I can't be expected to know where it is going to end up after that.

Q Understood. And the decision that was made to exit from the relationship, with the exception of the mortgage, was done by, is it fair to say, compliance folks at the bank?

A Yes.

Q And not by you?

A It was not. The decision was not mine.

MR. BLANCHE: Thank you. No more questions.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MS. MANGOLD: Nothing further, your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you, sir, you can step down.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness was excused.

THE COURT: Jurors, let's take our morning recess. Please remember to follow my instructions.

COURT OFFICER: All rise.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the jury exited the courtroom.

THE COURT: Thank you. Please be seated. People, is there anything you need to go over?

MR. STEINGLASS: Is this the time that you would like us to take up some of those outstanding issues?

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. STEINGLASS: Briefly, the parties did confer. I am handing up to the Court -- do you need another copy of this? I am handing up to the Court some proposed redactions as to Exhibit 171. The items that are circled in red, those are items that we have agreed to redact beyond what is already blacked out. The three tabbed red items are the remaining points of contention. We did reach a lot of progress on this.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. STEINGLASS: So, would you like me to talk about three?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: So, the first item in contention is on line 38909, in which Gina Rodriguez says she stopped it a long time ago because he threatened to sue me. Then the next one is on October 19th, and this is in the midst of, you can tell from the context here, in the midst of negotiations over the Stormy Daniels deal and kind of delays that were perceived as happening by Michael Cohen, that Ms. Rodriguez tells Dylan Howard, quote, very shady shit is going on.

THE COURT: What line are you on?

MR. STEINGLASS: It's 39540. That's on page 10.

MR. BLANCHE: Second from the bottom.

THE COURT: I see it.

MR. STEINGLASS: And then, finally, on page 11, and this is -- both of these are within about a week of the execution of the contract between Stormy Daniels and Mr. Trump. Yes, he is sending what she signed with Trump so he can get the story out with Fox this morning and nobody else would be afraid. Daily Mail is scared of Trump. This is on 39551 is the line for that and is the third tab. So, as I believe your Honor has, and will continue to instruct the jury, the Rodriguez portions of -- Ms. Rodriguez is not alleged to be a co-conspirator in this case. So, her texts are only coming in to contextualize Dylan Howard's texts. And Dylan Howard clearly is a co-conspirator in this case. We have no problem with the limiting instructions. We are not trying to argue the truth of the statements contained in Ms. Rodriguez's texts, but they do contextualize, A, what was going on in terms of the transactions and the negotiations at the time, and also Mr. Howard's responses. Of all of these three, we can, and I actually communicated this with Mr. Blanche, we can live without number one, if they feel so strongly about it. But I do think that the others are very relevant and very timely in terms of that being fact, that they are happening within a week or so of the transaction being finalized. So those are the ones we could not agree on.

MR. BLANCHE: We feel very strongly about all three. I think what we have done to try to appreciate your Honor's ruling, there are two -- and Ms. Rodriguez is not alleged to be an accomplice, and the only reason these are coming in is to provide, as the People just said, context. And so, with the first one, there is just no -- there is just no necessary reason to include that for context. So, it's not being offered for the truth. The very small potential, you know, benefit of it providing context, in our view, is greatly outweighed by the potential for the jury to have confusion and take it for the wrong reason, even with a limited instruction. That is the exact same reason for the other one as well. If you read all the texts and with all the evidence that has been permitted about what's happening in that week, no context is necessary in that situation given the risks that they are going to -- the jury would take, very shady shit is going on, for improper reasons. Who knows why she said it. We can all guess and speculate, but that's why it shouldn't come in. And then the last, your Honor, look, we don't think it should come in at all. We certainly do not think the last sentence in the clause of the first sentence should come in at the end of it. So, yes, he is sending what she signed with Trump so we can get the story out with Fox this morning, and then no one will be afraid. And the Daily Mail is scared of Trump. I mean, that's a hearsay statement that provides no context to the rest of the text exchange. So, that's -- we did agree on virtually everything. That's our very strong belief that those should be excluded as well.

THE COURT: All right. I will rule after the break. Thank you.

MR. STEINGLASS: And just on this redaction topic, we did agree on the proposed redactions to People's 163, which was the email involving Dino Sajudin. And so, we will swap out the version that's admitted into evidence with the redacted version. And, finally, we agreed to withdraw People's 170, which had, basically, one line that was not coming in for the truth, and we agreed to remove that exhibit. So we are withdrawing that exhibit.

THE COURT: Is it possible to pull that exhibit up just on my monitor?

MR. STEINGLASS: We can do it.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. STEINGLASS: And I believe there are two additional applications that Mr. Colangelo has if you want to entertain them at this time.

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. COLANGELO: First, in light of the Court's order this morning, holding the defendant in criminal contempt for nine willful violations of the Court's April 1st Order, the People wish to give supplemental Sandoval notice that if the defendant testifies in this trial, the People will seek to cross-examine him on those findings. We are not asking to be heard further now on this issue, but we would like to give notice to the Court and defense counsel as soon as possible so that if the defense intends to ask the Court to limit or prohibit cross-examination on any those nine willful violations, the Court can schedule a Sandoval hearing at the Court's convenience and we will be prepared to address the remaining issues.

THE COURT: Would you like to be heard briefly?

MR. BLANCHE: I haven't read the Decision yet. We very much want to be heard, not right now.

THE COURT: Okay. You have time to read the Decision.

MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, your Honor. The second matter relates to one of the Court's pretrial evidentiary rulings that the Court asked the People to re-raise at an appropriate point. We think now is not that point, but soon is the appropriate point. This relates to the People's request to introduce evidence regarding the defendant's attempt to dissuade witnesses, including Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, through a public pressure campaign, retaliation, harassing comments, including in public remarks and online. The Court originally held in its Order on the People's motions in limine, reserved the item pending an offer of proof. We made the offer of proof on April 15th. The Court held at that time that the evidence regarding the intimidation and pressure campaign was probative for multiple purposes, including the defendant's guilty conscious and to explain witnesses changing their position, but the Court excluded that evidence subject to the defense opening the door. And the Court -- I believe the Court said the issue might well be academic because the defense was likely to open the door. We believe the defense did, in fact, as your Honor predicted, open the door in opening statements last week, and they did so in the opening statement in several ways. Counsel stated that the evidence would show that Mr. Cohen was previously loyal and defended the defendant on television, publicly and privately. And then, after getting caught in 2018, Mr. Cohen made the decision to blame the defendant for his problems, and he is an admitted liar, and that's at pages 899 to 900. Defense counsel also said the evidence would show that Mr. Cohen's expected testimony can't be believed because his goal is to go on television and social media and his entire financial livelihood depends on attacking the defendant. The defense made a similar or same assertions as to Stormy Daniels, another expected witness, stating that the evidence would show that she previously denied an improper relationship in writing, and that she was now making a living off of the defendant by talking about her interactions with him, including through a book and a documentary. All of those assertions that defense counsel made in the opening statement about what the evidence would show regarding the credibility of those witnesses are precisely the kinds of arguments or assertions that your Honor predicted the defense would make and stated, would open the door to the People being allowed to elicit evidence regarding the defendant's efforts to keep them in the fold, keep Mr. Cohen in the fold originally, followed by subsequent harassment online. So we ask the Court -- I am sorry. When the Court made that ruling on April 15th, the Court said the People should bring this back to me if at any point you believe that the defense has opened the door. So we ask the Court, in light of the opening statements, to hold that the People may introduce evidence to offset the defense claim that these witnesses are somehow benefiting from their willingness to testify to explain why both witnesses initially denied certain facts and now acknowledge those facts and as evidence of the defendant's consciousness of guilt. Thank you.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, at the very least, there should be a proffer beyond just we are going to elicit all of this information about a pressure campaign and what the questions will be. We certainly opened the door that we will expose bias by Mr. Cohen and by other witnesses, for sure, and we intend to cross-examine witnesses about their bias, including their financial motivation in testifying the way they are today. That's different in kind than eliciting -- well, depending on what the questions will be, questions about a pressure campaign, because of public tweets or Truths by President Trump at the time, and presumably now. So, before we -- before your Honor rules, we would ask the People to proffer what it is, specifically, they intend to elicit from the witnesses or extrinsically prove regarding this and go from there.

THE COURT: Well, if the door has been opened, I think we will know what they are going to ask when they ask it, and if there is an objection, you can make your objection, unless the People would like to disclose what it is.

MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, the evidence that we will offer is the evidence that Mr. Steinglass presented during the offer of proof that we made to your Honor on April 15th. That was -- that's recorded in the transcript on April 15th, I believe, starting at page 41 and going through your Honor's ruling at 58. In that colloquy, the People disclosed and -- described broadly and disclosed half a dozen or more exhibits that we intend to elicit as part of the pressure campaign and the intimidation effort. We also described it at length in our February 22nd motion in limine describing the Molineux information that we intended to bring out. So, we are happy to bring those exhibits up again to the extent your Honor wishes to see them again. It's the evidence and the discussion of that evidence that we presented on April 15th.

THE COURT: Could you go over that one more time, the three purposes you want to elicit this?

MR. COLANGELO: Yes. First, is to offset the defense claim that the witnesses are benefiting from their willingness to testify. And by showing, to rebut that claim, that, in fact, their cooperation with law enforcement has harmed them more than it has helped them. Your Honor will remember that in explaining the allowable use of this evidence for that purpose, my colleague mentioned the People versus Edwards case and handed it up on April 15th to the Court. The second purpose is to explain why both witnesses initially denied certain facts and have now acknowledged those facts. And the third purpose is as evidence of the defendant's consciousness of guilt. And if I can just direct your Honor's attention to the transcript -- to the transcript of the April 15th proceeding, starting at page 56. Your Honor already observed following the People's proffer of that evidence, quote, you can't dispute that virtually everything that you put up is probative of something to some degree, whether it is consciousness of guilt to explain Mr. Cohen's turnaround to offset allegations that the witness is somehow benefiting from this. So, your Honor recognized those purposes that the People should not elicit anything until the defense opened the door, and our point now is that it is clear that the opening statements opened the door wide.

THE COURT: Can you go ahead and articulate what the consciousness of guilt would be? What was it about these actions that goes to consciousness of guilt?

MR. COLANGELO: Sure. So, your Honor, public statements, and the public statements, in particular, that we are thinking of are comments regarding Michael Cohen during early 2018, immediately after the FBI raid and seizure of his devices, and the raid of his homes, saying things like, some people may flip if they are put under pressure, but Michael Cohen is not that kind of person. Followed immediately after, he plead guilty in August of 2018, by other public statements that changed his tune entirely. Then he said things like, if anybody is looking for a good lawyer, Michael Cohen is not your person. I am paraphrasing. But it's in the tweets referring to Paul Manafort, and saying, Paul Manafort will never crack, unlike other people who will flip if the government puts them under pressure. So that's evidence of a coordinated effort to bolster the witness and to prevent him from cooperating by saying nice things about him publicly, and as soon as he began cooperating, attacking him, which is classic evidence of consciousness of guilt by intimidating and attacking a witness.

THE COURT: Go on.

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, consciousness of guilt is much different than what the People just described. Consciousness of guilt would allow the People to say, how do you know that he is guilty, Ladies and Gentlemen?  Well, look what he did on this day which shows consciousness of guilt. The idea that President Trump was somehow feeling guilty or consciousness of guilt about the indictment in this case, when he was speaking about Michael Cohen and pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York to crimes that Presidents Trump isn't charged with and never was charged with, doesn't work, right. Meaning that there are 34 counts here of falsifying business records. There is -- the statements that President Trump made at the time of leading up to, and at the time of Michael Cohen's guilty plea were not consciousness of guilt of anything happening in this courtroom. And the risk that the jury will hear that and use it for an improper purpose is huge, right. Is it frustrating to have your lawyer plead guilty and publicly say he is going to cooperate and testify against you?  Of course. And similarly, statements along the way encouraging his lawyer not to is not surprising either. Consciousness of guilt is of a different order. Consciousness of guilt would be President Trump doing something as it relates to the charges in this case that would show his motivation for doing it was to cover something up that would show that he is guilty. So, with respect to the other proffered reasons for some of this testimony to counter financial benefits to Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels and to explain why they changed their story, that makes sense. And I think they are going to talk about that on direct, but consciousness of guilt is of a different order, in our view.

THE COURT: Do you need a ruling on this?

MR. COLANGELO: We don't need a ruling today, but understanding your Honor's view by Thursday will help us plan the presentation of the rest of the case.

THE COURT: Thank you. See you in a few minutes.

COURT OFFICER: All rise.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Court exited the courtroom.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Short recess is taken.

THE CLERK: Case on trial continued. All parties are present.

THE COURT: Mr. Blanche, I will ask you again, let's try to keep it very short because we took a lot of time deciding issues, and I don't want to keep the jury waiting. Let's do better. I am prepared to rule on a couple of issues raised beforehand. Are you ready to argue Sandoval?

MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, can we argue that at another time?

THE COURT: Sure. With regard to the transcripts, I agree with the defense that these are exchanges between a co-conspirator and someone who is not a co-conspirator saying pretty prejudicial things, and I don't really think they serve a purpose. So, I am going to rule with the defense, that those must stay out. Regarding the defense opening the door, I think going through the words by the defense, they mostly concede they opened the door. The question is as to what, what can you use that for. I agree that it opened the door, and you can use it to explain what I will describe as a lot of back and forth amongst the main witnesses. Also, you can use it to reply or explain that they have not made as much money as the defense would have people think. At this point, I don't believe that it really goes to consciousness of guilt. So, I am going to deny that request. They can use it for the first two reasons, not for the third.

MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you. Just to confirm, Judge, 171A is in. It's just the three texts we talked about that have to be redacted?

THE COURT: That's right. Thank you both for working that out. I appreciate it. Can we bring the jury in? Let's get the jury, please.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Principal Court Reporter, Susan Pearce-Bates, was relieved by Senior Court Reporter, Theresa Magniccari.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The following proceedings are continued from previous page:

THE COURT: There was one issue that was raised on the break. One of the jurors, I believe it was Juror Number 9, asked the sergeant if we were going to be working Friday before Memorial Day. Apparently, she has a flight at 11 o'clock in the morning. That is May 24th. Is there any objection from either side to not working that day so that this juror can remain with us?

MR. STEINGLASS: No objection. Mr. BlANCHE:  No objection.

THE COURT: Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury entering courtroom.

THE CLERK: Continued case on trial, People versus  Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are present.

THE COURT: Before we call the next witness, I did want to go over two scheduling matters. I was informed by the sergeant that one of the jurors was asking whether we're going to work on the Friday before Memorial Day. Apparently, that juror has travel plans and they have a flight at 11. I was intending to work that day. Given that one of the jurors is not able to join us, we will go ahead and take that day off. That is May 24th. We will also not be working on May 17th. May 17th and May 24th. Thank you. Please call your next witness.

MS. MANGOLD: The People call Dr. Robert Browning.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness entering courtroom.

COURT OFFICER: Remain standing. Raise your right hand.

THE CLERK: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are going to give before this Court and jury shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, do you so swear or affirm?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Have a seat.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: D.R.  R-O-B-E-R-T   B-R-O-W-N-I-N-G,  called as a witness on behalf of the People, was duly sworn by the Clerk of the Court, upon being examined, testified as follows:

COURT OFFICER: Pull your chair all the way up. State your full name, spelling your last name.

THE WITNESS: My name is Robert X. Browning, B-R-O-W-N-I-N-G.

COURT OFFICER: County of residence?

THE WITNESS: Thibodaux County, Louisiana.

THE COURT: Good morning, Doctor. You may inquire.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MS. MANGOLD:

Q. Good morning, Dr. Browning. I am going to ask you to speak slowly into the microphone in front of you so the Court Reporter can take down what you are saying. Can you tell everyone where you work?

A. I work for C-Span.

Q. What is your position at C-Span?

A. Executive Director of the C-Span Archives.

Q. How long have you held that position?

A. Thirty-seven years.

Q. Have you ever testified in a legal proceeding before?

A. No, I have not.

Q. Are you nervous?

A. A little bit.

Q. We can take it slowly. If you need me to repeat a question, I am happy to do that. Do you understand that you are testifying today solely as a custodian of records for C-Span?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Did you travel from Louisiana for the purpose of testifying today?

A. Yes. Yes, I did.

Q. Is C-Span testifying at this trial voluntarily or was C-Span compelled to testify because it received a subpoena?

A. C-Span was compelled to testify with a subpoena.

Q. Is C-Span represented by counsel?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that counsel here today?

A. Yes, he is.

Q. Can you tell the jury a little bit more about C-Span. What does C-Span stand for?

A. C-Span, Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network.

Q. What is C-Span?

A. C-Span is a public television network to telecast events in their entirety.

Q. As Executive Director of the C-Span Archives, what do you do?

A. I mainly collect video that is aired on the network.

Q. In that role, have you become familiar with C-Span's business and recordkeeping practices?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Based on your, I think it was 37 years of experience with videos and political events, are you able to recognize prominent political figures in videos?

A. Yes, I can.

Q. Does that include Donald Trump?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. As part of its business, does C-Span air political events on TV?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. How does C-Span get the video footage for the events that it airs?

A. In a couple of ways. One, we would send our own cameras to events. Two, we would use what is known as a network pool.

Q. Can you explain to the jury what a network pool is?

A. When there is an event that sponsors want to limit the number of cameras or everyone wants to get the same video, the networks, which are the major broadcasting cable networks, pool together their resources and send one crew.

Q. Does that crew include a camera operator?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And when there is a camera operator from the network pool assigned to an event, is that camera operator physically at the event?

A. Yes, that is true.

Q. Does the camera operator record the event in realtime as it is occurring?

A. Yes, that's the obligation.

Q. Does the pool camera operator have a business duty to record that event accurately?

A. Yes, because C-Span wants the entire event.

Q. How does C-Span ensure that the video that it is getting is the correct video?

A. Once the event is taking place, there is a producer who watches the video from the beginning to the end and makes sure there are no interruptions in the transmission.

Q. Does a producer watching the video come in whether or not the video is being aired live on C-Span?

A. That is true.

Q. Is the video camera equipment tested before an event?

A. Yes, they make sure there is a valid signal; they would say the signal is good.

Q. That's a signal test?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there also an audio test?

A. Yes, they will make sure there is solid audio coming through the event.

Q. That's for every event?

A. Yes, that's true.

Q. While the video is being transmitted, does C-Span record it to its own servers in any way?

A. Yes, we make copies of the video as it is coming in.

Q. And does C-Span save those videos?

A. Yes, in the video library, the C-Span archives.

Q. Can you tell the jurors a little bit about the video library at the C-Span archives?

A. The video library is an online collection of everything that is telecast on C-Span. That's 278,000 digital hours a day.

Q. And that is everything that is ever aired on C-Span?

A. That's correct.

Q. It's still being maintained by C-Span?

A. That's right.

Q. Are you able to retrieve videos that were previously recorded?

A. Yes, we can search by a person's name or location or anything, even a word about the video.

Q. Does C-Span routinely record and save videos this way in the regular course of its business?

A. Yes, it's the nature of our business.

Q. Does C-Span rely on these videos to conduct their business?

A. We might re-air a program or search a program, as well as let the public use the program.

Q. Is it the regular course of business for C-Span to record and save these videos?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, at some point did C-Span receive a document subpoena from the Manhattan District Attorney's office requiring the company to turn over video recordings of events featuring Donald Trump?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. Did C-Span comply with its legal obligations to turn over those subpoenaed videos?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. Were you the one that retrieved the videos in response to the subpoena?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Can you tell the jury how you identified those videos?

A. Well, the subpoena indicated the videos that were requested, including what we call the URL of the video. But we would verify what each video -- that it matched the subpoena -- what the subpoena was.

Q. Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

A. Good morning.

Q. Can you tell the jury where you work?

A. I work for Esquire Deposition Solutions.

Q. What kind of company is Esquire Deposition Solutions?

A. We are a national court reporting company that hires court reporters, videographers and interpreters.

Q. How long have you worked there?

A. This is my eighth year.

Q. What is your current position?

A. My title is Regional Director of Field Operations for the South.

Q. And I am going to ask you to speak a little closer to the microphone so everyone can hear what you are saying. Are you familiar with something called TSG Reporting?

A. I am. TSG was a court reporting firm that we acquired in May of '22.

Q. In October of '22, was TSG a division of Esquire?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Did TSG have its own processes and procedures at that time?

A. Yes, they did.

Q. As a Regional Director at Esquire, are you familiar with the recordkeeping practices of Esquire and its divisions including TSG?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Do you understand that you're testifying today as a custodian of records for Esquire Deposition Solutions?

A. I do.

Q. Did you come from Texas for the purpose of testifying today?

A. I did.

Q. Is Esquire Deposition Solutions testifying voluntarily or in response to a subpoena?

A. In response to a subpoena.

Q. Does Esquire Deposition Solutions have counsel?

A. We do.

Q. Is counsel present in the courtroom today?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. For the folks who may not know, what is a deposition?

A. A deposition is a method to capture sworn testimony, typically in the discovery period of a civil suit.

Q. When you say "the discovery period in a civil suit," can you explain a little bit more what that is?

A. Sure. So the discovery process, it helps gather information when a lawsuit is filed.

A deposition is the process of getting sworn testimony before typically going into court.

Q. That's sworn testimony from a witness?

A. It is.

Q. And what do you mean by "sworn testimony?"

A. The witness is testifying under oath.

Q. Is a deposition recorded?

A. It is.

Q. Is it recorded sometimes in multiple ways?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And what are those ways?

A. It is taken down by a court reporter, who is taking down shorthand with the stenography machine. And then it's also taken by a videographer, so they are recording it live.

Q. And with respect to court reporters, is that similar to what the court reporters here are doing, taking down testimony in realtime?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. Is it still called a court reporter even if they're not sitting in a courtroom?

A. It is.

Q. And is it the court reporter's job to accurately transcribe the witness' testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. What type of document is produced after the deposition is over?

A. A deposition transcript.

Q. Is a deposition transcript a record of everything that the witness said during their sworn testimony?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Are deposition transcripts ever certified?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. And what does that mean?

A. The transcript is certified from the court reporter to be a verbatim copy of the deposition that was conducted that day.

Q. I think you mentioned that a deposition may also be recorded by a videographer; is that right?

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. What does the deposition videographer do?

A. They are there to record and capture the deposition of the video and audio.

Q. And that video is recorded while the deposition is taking place?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Is the videographer's job to accurately record the witness' testimony?

A. It is, yes.

Q. Are video depositions also certified?

A. No.

Q. Just the transcripts?

A. Just the transcript.

Q. Now, directing you specifically to TGS Reporting's recordkeeping practices in October 2022, I think you said TSG was a division of Esquire at that time?

A. That is correct.

Q. It had its own policies and practices?

A. That is correct.

Q. So for transcripts, after a deposition, did a court reporter send the transcript directly to the lawyers that were present in the deposition?

A. No.

Q. Where did they send them?

A. The court reporter would have sent it into TSG to do the production and send it out to all parties.

Q. Did TSG then save those transcripts?

A. They did.

Q. How were they saved?

A. The transcripts would have been saved in their share file account.

Q. What is a share file account in case people don't know?

A. It's similar -- it's more popularly known as dropbox or Box.com. It is a secure way to store large or voluminous files.

Q. In what ways was it secured?

A. The share file is encrypted, to my knowledge. I don't know how they encrypt it, but I do know it's encrypted.

Q. Is it also password protected?

A. It is.

Q. How about the videos produced by TSG in October 2022?

A. Yes, the videos.

Q. Were they transmitted also to TSG after each deposition?

A. Yes, they would have been sent to TSG's share file account as well.

Q. They were saved in that share file?

A. Yes.

Q. And the company took the same steps to make sure the videos were unaltered, including encryption and password protection?

A. That is correct.

Q. Does a witness have an opportunity to comment on any errors they think are in the transcript after it's done?

A. They do.

Q. Do you know what that is called?

A. It's called the errata process.

Q. And did TSG keep a record of any corrections by a witness to a deposition?

A. Yes.

Q. Does Esquire and TSG -- as part of Esquire, do they make and keep deposition transcripts and videos in the regular course of business?

A. Yes, we do.

Q. Was it the regular course of business for Esquire and TSG to keep deposition transcripts and videos?

A. Yes.

Q. Were the transcripts and videos made at the time of each deposition?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the court reporters and videographers have a business duty to record each deposition accurately?

A. Yes, they did.

A. I am.

Q. Did the subpoena require the company to turn over a video recording and transcript from an October 2022 deposition of Donald Trump in a case captioned "E. Jean Carroll versus Donald Trump," with the Case Number 20CV7311?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Esquire comply with its obligations to turn over that video transcript?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. Was the deposition transcript in that case certified?

A. It was.

Q. Did Esquire produce more than one version of the transcript?

A. To my knowledge, yes.

Q. Is it unusual to have more than one version of the deposition transcript?

A. No.

Q. Did Esquire have a record of the witness admitting any connections to that transcript?

A. We do not have a record of that.

Q. Did Esquire confirm that the transcripts produced to the Manhattan District Attorney's office -- did you confirm they were exact copies of the originals?

A. Yes.

Q. And they were produced without alterations, modifications or deletions?

A. That is correct.

Q. Did Esquire also produce the video of that same deposition to the Manhattan District Attorney's office?

A. We did.

Q. And Esquire produced an exact copy of the original deposition video?

MR. STEINGLASS: I offer into evidence People's Exhibits 276 through 286 as well as People's 62 through 65.

MR. BOVE: No objection.

THE COURT: People's 276 through 286 and 62 through 65 are received into evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibits 276 through 286, and 62 through 65 were received into evidence.

Q. Do you know somebody named Karen McDougal?

A. I do.

Q. In what context?

A. She was a client of mine.

Q. Do you remember how you came to meet her or be introduced to her?

A. I met her probably 25 years ago, she was dating a friend of mine.

Q. Okay. And in the summer of 2016, did you represent her?

A. Yes.

Q. In what capacity?

A. I represented her in order to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction she had.

Q. With whom?

A. With Donald Trump.

Q. And do you know, approximately, when it was that she became your client?

A. Not offhand.

Q. And do you know how it was that she became your client?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us, please?

A. Her former brother-in-law was a client of mine and her former brother-in-law, by the name of Jay Grdina, made the introduction or the re-introduction between Karen and I.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. So I am now showing you People's 279 in evidence. It's in evidence. It can be displayed to everyone. I am going to ask you when it pops up, if you recognize this document?

A. I do.

Q. What is it?

A. This is an email from me to Karen McDougal with the cc to Jay Grdina thanking her for the conversation of that day, 6/15/2016.

Q. And does the email also contain an attachment?

A. It does, yes. The attachment is a retainer agreement between me and my law firm and Karen.

Q. Is it fair to say you are sending her a blank retainer agreement?

A. I am sending her a signature ready retainer agreement for her signature.

Q. Got it. When I say "blank," I mean her signature line was blank, you were sending it to her for that purpose; is that right?

A. For execution.

Q. Got it. I believe you told us the date of the email was June 15, 2016?

A. Yes.

Q. So I want to show you Page 2 of this exhibit. Is this the first page of your retainer agreement?

A. Yes.

Q. I am going to ask that we blow up Paragraph 2. I am going to ask you to read that for us.

A. Paragraph 2:  Scope of Services: Client is hiring attorney to represent client in the matter of client's claims against Donald Trump, and/or assisting client in negotiating a confidential agreement and other live rights related to actions with Donald Trump, and/or negotiating an assignment with exclusive press opportunities regarding the same.

Q. Can you translate that for us?

A. I was to provide legal services to Karen McDougal and provide advice and counsel to her surrounding a personal interaction she had allegedly had with Donald Trump.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Theresa Magniccari, Senior Court Reporter wa

Q And is one of the ways in which -- withdrawn. This paragraph is entitled Scope of Services; correct?

A Yes.

Q Does one of the contemplated services include, potentially, negotiating the assignment of exclusive press opportunities regarding her interaction with Mr. Trump?

A That's true.

Q What does that mean, "negotiating the assignment of exclusive press opportunities"?

A (Pause) At that time, in mid-Two-Thousand-Teens or so, media outlets, both traditional and tabloid, would, often times, enter into exclusive arrangements where someone would provide an exclusive content to that media outlet in exchange for money.

Q And did you -- you wrote this Retainer Agreement; correct?

A I believe so.

Q And did you contemplate -- withdrawn. Did you discuss with Ms. McDougal the fact that you were authorized to negotiate on her behalf in dealing with various media outlets?

A I can't and won't discuss what I discussed with Ms. McDougal. I think that the paragraph speaks for itself.

Q Okay. Thank you for pointing that out. So, let me ask the question a different way. Did this Agreement -- did you interpret this Agreement as authorizing you to interact and negotiate with media companies on your client's behalf?

A Yes.

Q Thank you. So, directing your attention to June of 2016, did there come a time when you reached out to Dylan Howard regarding the potential Karen McDougal story?

A Yes.

Q Did you do this behind your client's back?

A No.

Q Did you reveal client confidences when you spoke with Mr. Howard?

A No.

Q I'm going to show you what is already in evidence and can be displayed to everyone as People's Exhibit 176A.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, People's Exhibits are shown on the screens throughout the following testimony:

Q I'm going to ask you if you recognize this series of messages to be texts between yourself and Dylan Howard from the year 2016?

A I do.

Q Have you had a chance to review the substance of these texts?

A I have.

Q And are the texts that appear on this exhibit the exact texts you sent and received to and from Dylan Howard?

A They are.

Q Do you have any reason to doubt the accuracy of the date and timestamps?

A I do not.

Q Okay.

MR. STEINGLASS: I am going to ask that we blow up the last two text boxes -- I mean, the last -- the last column, the first two boxes in the last column. Lines 111 through 112.

Q Let me ask you, first, can you tell what time zone these -- the date and timestamp is in?

A I think it's UTC.

Q Are you familiar with the relationship between UTC time and, let's say, West Coast Time or East Coast Time?

A Not particularly.

Q But these texts are dated particularly in UTC Time; is that right?

A Yes.

Q What is the date on this first text?

A June 7th.

Q And who is the first text in this chain from?

A It's from me.

Q To whom?

A Dylan Howard.

Q What is the body of the text?

A I have a blockbuster Trump story.

Q What did you mean by that?

A Sort of an entree or teaser to Dylan to let him know that I had, perhaps, an opportunity for him.

Q And what was the -- generally speaking, and certainly without revealing client confidences, what was the opportunity about which you were contacting him?

A Regarding the interaction between Karen McDougal and Donald Trump.

Q What did Mr. Howard say, if anything, in response?

A "Talk 1st thing. I will get you more than anyone for it. You know why."

Q What do you understand "Talk 1st thing" to mean?

A That he would call me in the morning.

Q What did you understand the rest of the text to mean?

A That -- I don't know if I had a clear understanding at that time, but I knew that Dylan's boss, David Pecker, and Mr. Trump were long-time friends and had a former business relationship, that Mr. Pecker published Trump Magazine, and that at the time AMI had announced -- they hadn't announced explicitly, at least impliedly, that they had endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.

Q So, Mr. Howard said, "Talk 1st thing." Did you, in fact, speak with Mr. Howard the following morning?

A I can't recall.

Q Well, did you continue to text back and forth with him about the Karen McDougal story?

A Yes.

Q During the course of those text messages, were there also times when you spoke with him on the phone?

A Yes.

Q So, I want to display some more texts from this exhibit, also still on Page 1 -- I'm just going to ask you to tell us who says what here.

A You would like me to read these texts?

Q Please. And tell us who each one is from as you're doing that.

A From Dylan: "Did he cheat on Melania?"

Q Who did you understand "he" to be referring to?

A Donald Trump.

Q Okay. Next text. From whom?

A From Dylan.

Q Okay.

A "Do you know if the affair was during his marriage to Melania?"

Q Again, do you understand "his" to be a reference to Donald Trump?

A Yes.

Q And how did you respond to this text?

A "I really cannot say yet. Sorry."

Q Is that because you didn't know or because you weren't prepared to discuss the details at that point?

A It was because it was the latter, because I was not prepared to discuss the details at that point.

Q And how did Mr. Howard respond?

A "Okay. Keep me informed."

Q Now, in connection with your representation of Karen McDougal, did you arrange a meeting between Karen McDougal and Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q And were others present as well for that meeting?

A Yes.

Q Who was present for that meeting?

A Jay Grdina was present, and a man by the name of Johnny Crawford was present, and Ms. McDougal.

Q Who is John Crawford?

A He was a friend of Karen's. I think a former police officer in Phoenix, Arizona.

Q Where did this meeting take place?

A In my office.

Q Do you remember the date that the meeting took place?

A Not offhand.

Q Were you present for the meeting?

A I was.

Q Okay. Let's see if some more texts in this chain can help refresh your recollection.

MR. STEINGLASS: Switch to Page 2, Line 11 -- 11140.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Do you see this text here?

A Yes.

Q And can you tell what date that was sent on?

A June 20, 2016.

Q What is the substance of the text?

A This is from Dylan Howard: "Landed. En route to your office."

Q So, does that refresh your recollection about what date the meeting took place between yourself, Dylan Howard, Karen McDougal and her friend?

A Yes.

Q What was discussed during this meeting?

A The subject of the Retention Agreement between Karen and I. The personal attraction that Karen had with Donald Trump.

Q Given the presence of others at this meeting, do you believe that the contents of what Ms. McDougal said was privileged?

A No.

Q So, can you tell us the substance of what Ms. McDougal said about the nature of her interactions with Mr. Trump during this meeting?

A I can summarize it.

Q That's fine.

A Ms. McDougal alleged that she had had a -- a romantic affair with Donald Trump some years prior.

Q And -- withdrawn. When you say "romantic", does that include sexual?

A That's what she expressed.

Q And do you know how long that romantic and sexual affair lasted -- withdrawn. As a result of what Ms. McDougal said in that meeting, which was non-privileged, do you know how long that affair lasted for or how long she said it lasted for?

A I can't recall, specifically. It was several weeks to months, if not more. I can't recall, specifically.

Q Okay. Now, generally speaking, Mr. Davidson, what was the purpose of this meeting between your client and Dylan Howard?

A It was sort of a proffer session where -- where Ms. McDougal would -- under agreement that nothing was to be published, where Ms. McDougal would tell her story to Dylan Howard on behalf of AMI, so that Dylan could gauge interest in the story, whether or not AMI did or did not have interest in this story.

Q Now, did the meeting result in an immediate deal with AMI?

A No, it did not.

Q How did you leave it with Dylan Howard?

A Um, Dylan wanted to -- to return to New York, um, run it up the flagpole, and stated that he would get back to me.

Q When you say "run it up the flagpole", who, to your knowledge, was higher at AMI, higher than Dylan Howard?

A It's my understanding that the only one higher than Dylan Howard at AMI was David Pecker.

Q So, very generally speaking, in the weeks that followed, what happened after that?

A I think Dylan -- the first entree, if you will, was that Dylan stated that AMI was not interested at that time because Karen lacked -- excuse me -- Karen, Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction.

Q So, how did you leave it?

A Um, I think we just said we would keep in touch.

Q Okay. So, let me show you some more of these texts, and I'll blow up Page 4, Lines 11116 and 67.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, further exhibits are shown on the screens throughout the following testimony:

Q I'm going to ask you again to read us these texts and tell us who sent them.

A This is June 27th, from me to Dylan Howard. "It's a story" -- misspelling, but -- "a story that should be told."

Q Just to clarify for the record, the body of the text actually says:  "It's a story hat should be told." You're saying that's a typo, and it should be, "It's a story that should be told"?

A Yes. Correct.

Q How -- withdrawn. What "story" were you referring to?

A The interaction between Ms. McDougal and Mr. Trump.

Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

A "I agree."

Q Now, moving to some later texts on this page, we'll blow them up, Lines 11227 through 31. I'll ask you, first of all, what is the date of this particular exchange?

A June 21st.

Q You sure about that month?

A July. July 21st.

Q So, it had been some time at this point?

A That's right.

Q What -- who sent what and when?

A This is from Dylan Howard: "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross tomorrow. I think this is the entree for me to go back to them."

Q To reiterate, Mr. Davidson, during this period, the -- more than a month had passed since your June 20th meeting with Dylan Howard, and your client, and the others in your offices. Were you in phone communication with Dylan Howard, as well, during this time?

A Yes.

Q And so, when -- first of all, I'm going to ask you, what did you understand it to mean when Dylan Howard wrote, "Let's talk DT, slash, Ross tomorrow"? Who's "DT"? What's "DT"?

A My understanding was it was Donald Trump.

Q What's "Ross"?

A "Ross" was a man named Brian Ross. I think he was a broadcaster, a news broadcaster; and I think he was, at the time, heavily investigating for reporting for ABC News.

Q Is it fair to say, during this period of time, you were also negotiating with ABC News on Karen McDougal's behalf?

A That's true.

Q Had they expressed interest in acquiring Karen McDougal's story?

A Yes.

Q When Dylan Howard wrote: "I think this is the entree for me to go back to them," who did you understand Dylan Howard would be going back to?

A Certainly, David Pecker. I don't know if I had an understanding, or if I read the text that closely, that there was anyone other than Pecker at the time.

Q That's fine. How did you respond to that?

A "Better be quick."

Q What did you mean by that?

A At the time, as is often the case with negotiations, I was trying to play two entities off of each other.

Q And what's the -- what's the objective?

A To create a sense of urgency, if you will.

Q And -- withdrawn. Is there anything wrong with that?

A No.

Q Can you explain why not?

A I don't understand your question.

Q Yeah. I'm not sure I do, either. You've been a lawyer for how long?

A Twenty-four years.

Q Is there anything wrong with a lawyer negotiating on behalf of their client to get the best possible deal for their client?

A I think that's our duty.

Q And did you view it as your duty to try to get the best deal you could for your client at the time?

A Yes.

Q Whether that deal was from AMI or from ABC or from somewhere else?

A Correct.

Q So, do I understand you correctly to be saying that when you said, "Better be quick," you were trying to convey that there was some urgency and that Dylan Howard should act quickly?

A That's fair.

Q Okay. Keep going, please.

A This is from me to Dylan Howard:  "Will do."

Q What did Dylan Howard say?

A "I know.

Q Did he say anything else?

A "I emailed and said we need to talk urgently."

Q What do you understand that to mean? Who had Dylan Howard emailed?

A Perhaps, David Pecker.

Q Okay. So, directing your attention to the last blown-up line on Page 4, is this another exchange between you and Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q And who wrote this?

A This is from Dylan Howard -- no. This is from me.

Q On what day?

A July 22nd.

Q And what's the body of the email or -- sorry -- the body of the text?

A "Don't forget about Cohen. Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered" -- this is -- "the girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia."

Q So, who is "Cohen" in this email?

A Michael Cohen.

Q And what did you mean by "time is of the essence"? The same as the "better be quick" email or text from earlier?

A Yeah. I think, at the time, Karen was sort of teetering. She was about to enter into a deal with ABC.

Q And what did you mean by "The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia"?

A It's a very unfortunate, regrettable text I sent. That phrase is -- is not one that I used or came up with. That -- that term, I think, by one of -- one of Karen's --

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: witness clears throat) -- associates that was at that first meeting. There was several women who were, um, leaning on Karen to sign the deal with ABC

Q So, taken as a whole, is this text another effort to spur Dylan Howard into action?

A Yes.

Q Okay. So, turning to Page 5 of the exhibit, and directing your attention to some of the lines between 250 and 273. I'm going to ask you, first, what day is this exchange?

A July 22nd.

Q So, same day as the last text?

A Yes.

Q So, how did Dylan Howard answer your text?

A "Yep. I plugged a call in." We [sic] "will have news by Monday."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A That they would have an offer for Karen on Monday.

Q The following day, July 23rd, do you see another communication from Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q What does that text say?

A He says: "Get me a price on McDougal. All in. Consulting gig perhaps as a fitness expert thrown into the mix."

Q What did you understand that to mean from Dylan Howard?

A Karen had expressed at that initial meeting that she had three goals that she wanted to accomplish. And I think he was trying to address each of those goals in order to persuade her that AMI was the right avenue for her to use.

Q What were the three goals?

A To rejuvenate her career, one. To -- to make money, two. And, three, um, to avoid telling a story and being termed "the scarlet letter", becoming "the scarlet letter"; the, quote, "other woman".

Q So, if possible, Ms. McDougal did not want to have to tell her story?

A She did not want to tell her story.

Q Now, the ABC deal that you were also working on on her behalf, would that have required her to tell her story?

A Yes.

Q I'm not going to ask you about client confidences, so I'll just ask you this: Is it your understanding that one of the more attractive aspects of the AMI deal was that she might not actually have to tell that story, or she wouldn't have to tell her story?

A Well, that was one of her stated goals, and that would be in alignment with one of her very important stated goals.

Q So, Mr. Howard says:  "Get me a price. All in," et cetera. How do you respond?

A It's a negotiation, and so I started high and threw out a million dollars. I said: "How about one million now and 75,000 a year for the next two years as a fitness correspondent for AMI and your related publications?"

Q So, you -- you almost translated that text a little bit as you read it; right? The number "1M" you read as "one million"; is that correct?

A Would you like me to read it?

Q That's fine.

A "1M" is one million, yes.

Q And "75K" is "75,000"?

A Yes.

Q I know this sounds silly, but "ur" is shorthand for the words "you are"?

A Yes.

Q And "pubs" is short for "publications"?

A Yes.

Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

A "I'll take it to them but thinking it's more hundreds than millions."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A That was -- I should expect a counteroffer that was substantially less than a million.

Q Okay. And how did you respond to that?

A "800,000 now and 100,000 per year for two years for a total of one million."

Q Again, just to make a clear record -- I'm sorry I have to do that each time. "800" means "800,000"; "100" means "100,000"; and "1M" means "one million"?

A Yes.

Q How did Mr. Howard respond?

A "Leave with me."

Q How did you take that?

A That we really weren't in the same ballpark.

Q Okay. So, next page. Lines 280 through 282; I'll ask you to, first, tell us what is the date that that exchange takes place on.

A July 28th.

Q Okay. And what do the texts say? Start with the first one you sent back.

A This is from Dylan:  "We are going to lay it on thick for her."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A I think at this point in time, Karen was teetering between two competing deals, and we had requested a meeting where -- where each entity could make a pitch as to why they were the correct avenue for Karen.

Q Okay. And how did you respond to that?

A "Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking the Isle of Mann."

Q What did you mean by that, Mr. Davidson?

A It was sort of in jest. But, it was -- it was just a joke.

Q Um, so, what -- I'm trying to think about how to phrase this question. Why was that a joke? Why was that funny? What was going on in your mind when you made that joke?

A Well, I don't think -- I don't think -- I don't even think the Isle of Mann is a country.

MR. STEINGLASS: (Laughs).

A And I know they don't have an ambassador. But, I think it was a reference to Mr. Trump's candidacy.

Q Can you just explain that a little bit more?

A That, somehow, if Karen did this deal with AMI, that it would help Donald Trump's candidacy.

Q And at the time that you sent that text in jest, did you understand that AMI was working with then-candidate Trump regarding your client?

A I don't know about that. I don't know that I had specific information that they were or not working with him. I knew that they had announced their support for Mr. Trump, but I don't know that they were working with him.

Q Okay. Is it safe to assume from your joke that you had an understanding that if you were to close your deal, this would somehow benefit the candidate, Donald Trump?

A Yes.

Q So, I want to turn your attention to Page 6, the next few lines, 292 to 293. I'll ask you, what is the date of these texts?

A July 28th.

Q Yes. I'm sorry. July 28th. That's right. Go ahead.

A This was from Dylan Howard: "She'll get more out of a deal with AMI than ABC. And I'm happy to sign some sort of agreement that alleviates some fears about jurisdiction/meeting only with AMI."

Q That's a text from Dylan. That means Dylan Howard; correct?

A Yes.

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A I -- I understand the first part, the first sentence. I'm not so sure I understand the second sentence.

Q Okay. Well, tell us about the part you do understand.

A "She'll get more out of a deal with AMI than ABC," I think that's self-explanatory. And Dylan was making his case why they were the right avenue for Karen to choose.

Q Okay. How did you respond?

A "I need this to happen."

Q Now, Mr. Davidson, based on non-privileged communications to which you were privy, why did you need this to happen? Why did Karen McDougal prefer the AMI deal to the ABC deal?

A Because she -- at that time -- at that time, based on non-privileged information, she had announced her desire to not tell the story about her interaction with Donald Trump.

Q So that -- withdrawn. Part of the allure of the AMI deal was that she wouldn't have to; is that your understanding?

A Yes.

Q I am showing you now People's 280 in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q I'm going to ask you if you recognize this?

A I do.

Q What is it?

A This is -- it's a meeting invitation, a Zoom invitation from me to Jay Grdina, Karen McDougal, and Dylan Howard.

Q You said "Zoom". Is it a video conference? Is Ring Central a video conferencing platform, much like Zoom?

A Yes.

Q Who did you invite? You just told us. Did this meeting, in fact, take place on this day?

A I believe -- it definitely took place. I assume it took place this day.

Q The date of the invite was August 2, 2016?

A Yes.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q Good afternoon, Mr. Howard [sic]. I just want to put -- that's the second time. Good afternoon, Mr. Davidson. I want to show you part of a text exchange we were looking at before lunch. This is from People's 176A, Lines -- Page 6, Lines 292 to 293.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, exhibits are shown on the screens throughout the following testimony.

Q So, that last text that's sent on July 29th at 2:24 AM UTC time, is that text to you from Dylan Howard or the other way around?

A It's from Dylan Howard to me.

Q And, so, when Dylan Howard said, "I need this to happen," how did you interpret that?

A I don't know. I suppose I interpreted it that he wanted it to happen.

Q You mean, "it" being the deal with Karen McDougal and AMI?

A Yes, sir.

Q Okay. Continuing on with this exhibit to the next page, Page 7, I'm going to blow up Lines 314 to 319. Again, I'll ask you to give us the date, the to and the from, and the substance of these emails -- texts.

A You want me to read right through all of them?

Q Sure. Start with the date and time of the first one, please.

A This is August 2nd, from me to Dylan Howard: "I can't believe they are asking me to go back to you for another 25 but they are. He deal is accepted at 150. Can you do that?"

Q A couple of questions about that. First of all, does "25" mean "25,000"?

A Yes.

Q And "he deal", should that read "the deal"?

A Yes.

Q Who was asking you to go back for another $25,000?

A It would be Mr. Grdina and Karen McDougal.

Q And how did Dylan Howard respond?

A "He just called me. 'F' it. Not my money. I'll ask."

Q When you said, "F it," is the full "F" word written out in the text?

A Yes.

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A Um, that someone just called him, and that he didn't care about money because it wasn't his; he would run it up the flagpole.

Q "He didn't care about money; he would run it up the flagpole;" you're referring to Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q Okay. The next text please, who is that from?

A From me, to Dylan: "Let's try and wrap up Karen's deal. She is getting repeated phone calls from Rhonda Schwartz."

Q What did you mean by that?

A That the deal was getting stale. It had been left on the counter for a bit. And if he wanted to close it up, now was the time.

Q Who is Rhonda Schwartz?

A Rhonda was with the Investigation Department at ABC News. She works or worked for Brian Ross.

Q Okay. How did he respond?

A Dylan responded:  "We are figuring out the mechanics of the deal already."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A Just, that they were figuring out how to paper the deal.

Q Paper the deal between Karen McDougal and AMI?

A Yes.

Q Did he add something after that?

A "Right now I mean."

Q Did you respond?

A I responded: "Got it."

Q Okay. Also, on Page 7, Lines 320 and 321, what is the date of this exchange?

A August 5, 2016.

Q And who sent the first text in this blown-up portion of these -- this exchange?

A Dylan Howard to me. "Cameron's" -- excuse me. This is August 5, 2016. It's from me to Dylan.

Q Okay. What did you say?

A "Cameron's agreement wasn't really even close to what we were expecting. Please review the red-line I just sent. Need to handle this quickly."

Q First of all, who is "Cameron"?

A Cameron Stracher is General Counsel for AMI.

Q What is a "red-line"?

A A "red-line" is just modifications or corrections to an editable document that's like -- it's a step along the way in modifying a document.

Q So, what did you mean when you said that his agreement wasn't close to what you were expecting?

A We had come to terms by this point with AMI on the deal points. And there was a Short-Form Agreement or at least deal points. And that that was negotiated between Dylan and I. And then Dylan, as a content editor, handed it off to the Legal Department at AMI, Cameron. And when the Short-Form Agreement or the deal points morphed into the Long-Form Agreement with Cameron, they didn't jive.

Q So, do I understand you correctly to be saying that Cameron had sent you a contract, and it did not match your understanding of what you thought the deal was that had been negotiated between yourself and Mr. Howard?

A Correct.

Q So, when you refer to "the red-line", does that mean you made proposed changes to the contract they had sent over and sent it back?

A I believe so. But, it -- the red lines were either extremely extensive -- I mean, it was difficult to red-line something that didn't even closely resemble, I believe to my recollection, the deal points that we came up with.

Q And you ended the text by saying: "Need to handle this quickly." Why was there a need to "handle this quickly"?

A Just, on my side of the aisle, there was a growing frustration with the process.

Q And how, if at all, did Dylan Howard respond to your text?

A "I asked Cam to call you."

Q Continuing on to the next page and directing your attention to the blown-up line, which is 322. Did you send another text that same day?

A Yes.

Q And can you read us that text, please?

A "He" -- this is from me to Dylan. "He wants me to call Cohen. You think that's okay? I've been trying like hell to avoid that."

Q What did you mean by that? First of all, who wanted you to call him?

A Cam. Cameron Stracher.

Q And what was your understanding of why Cam wanted you to call Michael Cohen?

A (No response).

Q Withdrawn. Between that last text and this text, did you have a conversation on the phone with Cameron?

A I did.

Q Can you tell us about it?

A Not only -- not only were we not on the same page between the Short-Form and the Long-Form, and then Dylan asked me to call Cameron; and I did call Cameron, and even when we spoke, we still weren't on the same page. I think I told him that. I know I told him that. I said, "Look, this agreement doesn't nearly comport to what was agreed to in the deal points." I think I was frustrated. He was frustrated, and he said, "Why don't you just call Cohen?"

Q "He", meaning Cam suggested you call Cohen?

A Yes.

Q Did you ask Mr. Stracher why he wanted you to call Michael Cohen if Michael Cohen had nothing to do with the deal?

A I -- I believe so. I probably did. I don't have a specific recollection. I thought it was odd, certainly.

Q Sorry?

A I thought it was odd.

Q And so, what did you mean when you said, "I've been trying like hell to avoid that?"

A My first interaction with Michael Cohen was in 2011, regarding that blog post that we discussed earlier. And my interaction with him around that time in 2011 was -- was not pleasant or -- or constructive, and I didn't particularly like dealing with him. And that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him.

Q Continuing on this text string from the same day, did -- I'm speaking, specifically, of Page 8, Lines 326 through 330. I'll just ask you to, again, read us through these texts, who sent them, and what they mean.

A August 5th, from Dylan Howard to me: "Okay. We are paying."

Q Let me stop you right there for a second. What did you understand that to mean?

A That they were ready to pay for the deal.

Q Okay. How did you respond? Or, how -- I guess, is that next text another text from Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q What does it say?

A "Glad it all sorted."

Q And then, did he say anything else?

A "Fucken Jesus."

Q You're quoting, so it's okay. Did you have any understanding of what that all meant, those three texts?

A I think it was just a frustrating deal for everybody involved, and it was -- it was just a lot of, sort of, heavy lifting.

Q And then what did you say?

A "Yes -- I believe so. I told Cohen this never would have happened without you."

Q How did Dylan Howard respond to that?

A "He's hopeless. Oh well. Another one done."

Q So, from this text exchange, does it appear -- let me ask this a different way. Did you call Cohen at some point in the middle of this text exchange?

A I recall that I did, yes.

Q And did you discuss the Karen McDougal contract with him at all?

A Yes.

Q And I'll come back to exactly how that conversation went in a minute. I want to take a minute to show you Grand Jury -- I'm sorry -- to show you People's Exhibit 62, which is in evidence.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q I'll just ask if you recognize this?

A Yes.

Q What is it?

A This is an email from me to Michael Cohen, asking him to call me.

Q And what is the date of this email?

A August 5, 2016.

Q And the time?

A 2:54 PM. Probably, Pacific Time.

Q Do you know if you produced this document or if this was produced by The Trump Organization? You want to look at the Bates stamp at the bottom?

A Sure.

Q On the -- on the documents that you produced, do your Bates start with the letters KMD?

A It did.

Q Does that indicate to you this may have been produced by The Trump Organization?

A It did.

Q Does that clarify at all whether the timestamp on this email was Eastern Time or Pacific Time, or you're not sure?

A I'm not sure. I know I called him after the deal closed with AMI and Karen.

Q This seems like a good opportunity to just tell us about the conversation you had with Michael Cohen.

A I seem to recall that after the deal closed with Michael Cohen -- excuse me. After the deal closed with AMI, I called Michael Cohen. And I can't recall specifically whether -- maybe Dylan asked me to or something, but I called him and let him know, as a professional courtesy, that the deal involving his client had closed. And I told him, as I stated to you and Dylan Howard, that: "This deal wouldn't have happened without Dylan."

Q Now, you said that you called Michael Cohen as a professional courtesy because the deal involving his client closed. What client is that?

A Donald Trump.

Q Was Donald Trump a party to this agreement, a named party to this agreement between yourself or between, I should say, Karen McDougal and AMI?

A No.

Q Did you recognize the extent to which the deal could benefit Mr. Cohen's client, Donald Trump?

A Yes.

Q What was Michael Cohen's reaction when you told him that the deal was closed?

A He was pleased.

Q Now, that deal between AMI and Karen McDougal, did that eventually -- did the contract eventually get signed?

A Yes.

Q And, generally speaking, what were the terms?

A There was a financial aspect of the deal. I think it was $150,000. It involved certain personal services that Karen would render to AMI, which included, um, magazine covers, weekly or monthly columns where she could write on subject matters that interested her, um, and I believe that was it.

Q As part of that deal, did AMI acquire Karen McDougal's limited life story rights to any romantic, personal and/or physical relationship with any then-married man?

A Yes.

Q Just to be clear, who negotiated these terms on behalf of AMI?

A Mainly, Dylan Howard, and then Cameron got involved at some point.

Q And on behalf of Karen McDougal?

A I did.

Q I am now showing you what's in evidence already as People's Exhibit 156.

MR. STEINGLASS: Can you show them to everyone?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Is this the final deal signed between AMI and Karen McDougal?

A Assuming that it's signed.

Q Well, we can skip to the last page, and I'll show you that.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, another page of the exhibit is shown on the screens.

A Yes. This is the final deal.

Q And going back to that first page for a minute, just blowing up the top portion, what is the "Effective Date" on this contract?

A August 5, 2016.

Q I am going to blow up Paragraph 3. I am just going to ask you to read it to yourself. You don't have to read the whole thing out loud. Read it to yourself, and let us know what you understood this paragraph to mean.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A Well, I'm ready.

Q Okay. Can you tell us what it means?

A That Karen had, in the process of entering into this contract with AMI, that she granted her Limited Life Rights related to the subject matter, any affairs she had with any then-married man to AMI. So that became, in effect, their intellectual property, their exclusive intellectual property.

Q Now, based on non-privileged communications to which you were privy, was there a particular then-married man with whom you understood this to apply?

A Yes.

Q Who?

A Donald Trump.

Q I'm going to move to Paragraphs 4 and 5 and ask you, first of all, does Paragraph 4 contain the amount that AMI was compensating Karen McDougal for her Limited Life Rights, as well as some of the other services that you mentioned?

A Yes.

Q How much was she being paid?

A 150,000.

Q How much of that went to you?

A Somewhere between -- I think 45 percent.

Q And Paragraph 5, can you read that paragraph out loud?

A Paragraph 5: "Nothing herein shall obligate AMI to use the Life Rights in connection with any media. AMI's obligations to McDougal shall be the payment to McDougal of the sum set forth in Paragraph 4 and the obligations set forth in Paragraph 1, 2.1 and 2.2.

Q Those paragraphs, 1, 2.1, 2.2, does that set out the other services that you mentioned?

A Yes.

Q What does this paragraph mean, Paragraph 5?

A It means that it was really AMI's option as to whether or not they ever wanted to run the story of Karen's interaction with any then-married man or not. It was their option to either run it or not.

Q Now, at the time this agreement was executed, did you believe AMI intended to publish the story?

A No.

Q Why did you believe that?

A I believe it was stated.

Q Stated by whom, if you remember?

A AMI.

Q Did you have an understanding as to why AMI would be purchasing a story that they didn't intend to print?

A I think there were two. I think one was -- one explanation that was given was that they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn't want to diminish her reputation. And the second was more of an unspoken understanding that there was a close affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump, and that AMI would not run this story or any story related to Karen and Donald Trump as it would tend to hurt Donald Trump.

Q When you say "hurt Donald Trump", you mean hurt Donald Trump's campaign?

A Yes.

Q Thank you. I want to show you Page 2, Paragraph 7.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Again, I'm not going to ask you to read this whole paragraph out loud. You can just read it to yourself, and when you're done, maybe you can tell us what it means.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A This is really an Exclusivity paragraph. It means the rights that Karen was transferring to AMI were Exclusive, and she could not -- she could not -- she retained no intellectual property rights in the story for herself; and that's one. And, two, that she cannot transfer them, subsequently, to anybody else.

Q She no longer owned her own story?

A The limited story.

Q The portion of the story that dealt with her affair with Donald Trump?

A Fair.

Q Is that true?

A True.

Q What would happen, according to this paragraph, if Karen McDougal did take her story elsewhere?

A The last sentence is a liquidated damages provision. She would owe back, basically, the 150.

Q Would she owe back the entire $150,000, even though she was doing magazine covers and columns?

A Pardon?

Q Would she owe back the entire 150,000, even though she was still doing the columns and magazine covers?

A Yes.

Q Going back to that signature on Page 3, did Karen McDougal sign this document?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

A Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: Can you blow up the bottom, please?

A Yes. Yes.

Q And --

MR. STEINGLASS: Can you blow up a little more of the bottom?

Q I would like to know what date she signed it

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the witness reviews the exhibit on his screen.

A Yeah. This is Johnny Crawford that we mentioned earlier, which is a notary. August 6, 2016.

Q And who, if anyone, signed the Agreement on behalf of AMI?

A I don't -- it looks to be Chief Content Officer, which would be Dylan Howard.

Q So, Dylan Howard's title is listed. Do you recognize whether or not that's his signature?

A Not particularly.

Q Okay. Let's go back to People's 176A in evidence. Specifically, Page 9, Lines 357 to 61.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q I'm going to ask you, this is this another text exchange between you and Dylan Howard from August 5, 2016?

A Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: Let me double-check one moment. I think I misspoke.

Q Is this a text exchange between you and Dylan Howard from August 8th of 2016?

A Yes. What was the date of that AMI? The 5th? That last exhibit?

Q I don't want to testify. We can pull that back up. I believe you told us it was signed on August 6th. Let me show you the first page in terms of the Effective Date.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

A Fair enough. Thank you.

Q So, just for the record, what is the Effective Date of the contract?

A August 5, 2016.

Q Okay. Going back now to what we were showing you before, some texts on Page 9 of 176A.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Lines 357 to 61. And were these texts back and forth sent on August 8th, and at the very bottom August 9th, of 2016?

A Yes.

Q And what do the texts say, please?

A This is from me to Dylan: "I am going to let ABC know that Karen has decided to keep her story quiet. I'm going to let them know that the family has begged and pleaded with her to not come out and that she has promised her family she wouldn't. I will have Karen ignore all of their calls. Any objection?"

Q What did you mean by that?

A I stated before we had parallel negotiations with AMI and ABC, and I needed to, sort of, off-board ABC. And I'll leave it at that.

Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

A "Yep, that's fine."

Q And what did you say after that?

A (Laughs) Um, "By the way, they promised her a role on Dancing With the Stars, season 578568655."

Q Was the number of the season another joke?

A Yes.

Q Does "BTW" stand for "by the way"? I know that is a silly question.

A Yes.

Q Had a potential role on Dancing With the Stars been part of the package that you were negotiating with ABC on behalf of Ms. McDougal?

A It was discussed a lot. Um, and it was -- there was an inference that best efforts would be made to make that happen, but it was never guaranteed, and it was never part of the deal. But -- best -- best efforts were discussed.

Q Okay. And how did Dylan respond?

A "Ha." A laugh.

Q Did he send you another text?

A Yes. "Payment will be made this week. FYI -- sooner rather than later. Is it going to you?"

Q Okay. Thank you very much.

MR. STEINGLASS: You can take that down.

Q Mr. Davidson, do you know someone named Stormy Daniels?

A Yes.

Q In what context?

A Stormy Daniels was a client of mine.

Q And are you aware of her going by any other names?

A Stephanie Clifford.

Q How did it come to be that you represented Stormy Daniels?

A Stormy Daniels was a talent, and she was managed by Gina Rodriguez, who we discussed earlier. And, so, Gina referred Stormy to me.

Q Got it. And what was your understanding of the relationship at the time between Stormy Daniels and Gina Rodriguez at the time?

A Gina was a talent manager, and Stormy was talent.

Q Was -- so, I guess my question is, was Gina Stormy's manager?

A Yes.

Q When you said -- earlier, you told us about a 2011 encounter Gina had with Michael Cohen and also involved Stormy Daniels?

A Yes.

Q In 2011, did you ever speak to Stormy Daniels, or did you deal exclusively with Gina Rodriguez, or someone else?

A I think I had a brief conversation with Stormy and Gina.

Q In 2011?

A Yeah. But, most of my conversations, I believe, were with Gina.

Q What, if anything, did you do on behalf of Stormy Daniels in 2011?

A Sent a Cease-and-Desist Letter to the blog that we mentioned earlier, The Dirty.com.

Q So, the name of the blog is The Dirty.com?

A Yes.

Q What was the nature of the story that was on the blog that caused you to send the Cease-and-Desist Letter?

A There was a blog post or a story posted on the website that stated that Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump had -- had some sort of a physical or romantic, um, interaction.

Q So, you said that in connection with this effort on your part, that you had a conversation with Michael Cohen?

A Yes.

Q Can you tell us how that came about and how that conversation went?

A Yes. Michael Cohen -- the blog post had published. And, apparently -- or, I was informed that Gina had received a phone call from Michael Cohen. And the phone call that she received from Michael Cohen, I think it was a voicemail. I know it was a voicemail. And it might have either been a voicemail or a phone call that was answered by Gina's ex-husband. In any event, Gina called me up to tell me that: "Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back."

Q I hate to ask it this way, but who was that "jerk"?

A It was Michael Cohen.

Q So, what happened when you called -- did you call Michael Cohen?

A I did.

Q Tell us about that.

A Gina provided me the number that he left, either with her ex or on the voicemail. It was for The Trump Organization. I called. I was transferred to Michael Cohen. I introduced myself. And before I could barely get my name out, I was just met with, like, a hustle barrage of insults and insinuations and allegations. That went on for quite a while.

Q What was the gist of what he was accusing you of?

A (Pause)  I don't think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming.

Q Okay. What was he upset about?

A He was upset that -- that the story on The Dirty.com got published, and he believed that Stormy Daniels was the source behind the story.

Q So, what did you tell him?

A Well, finally, um, after he finished, I -- I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story published, and I wanted to see if he had done anything to contact The Dirty to get that story taken down as of that time. He told me that he had not yet done anything. And then, when I told him that my client wanted it taken down, he was like: "Well, why don't you go have them do it and let me know how you make out."

Q How -- withdrawn. You said you sent a Cease-and-Desist Letter; right?

A Yes.

Q What happened as a result of you sending that Cease-and-Desist Letter?

A I was successful in accomplishing my client's goals, in having that story taken down.

Q That was in 2011?

A Yes.

Q Now, in the Summer and Fall of 2016, did you resume representation of Stormy Daniels in the matter of her liaison with Mr. Trump?

A In the Summer of 2016?

Q Yes. The Summer -- actually, I think the question was, Summer and Fall. You can clarify.

A I -- no, I don't believe so. I don't think it was until the Fall.

Q Okay. So, let me show you what's in evidence as People's 176A. This is that same set of text messages. I want to go back to Page 4; specifically, Lines 175 to 177.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Again, I'll ask you, is this another text exchange between you and Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q What is the date of this exchange?

A June 30, 2016.

Q What do the texts say?

A This is from Dylan to me: "FYI Gina trying to hawk Stormy again."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A Part of Gina's role and responsibility or services that she provided was to monetize stories in the press. She was like a story broker. And Dylan, obviously, was a purchaser of stories. So, I interpreted from this text that Dylan had been approached by Gina, who was trying to sell the story regarding Stormy and Donald Trump again.

Q And did you respond in some way?

A I responded: "LOL -- she's trying to sell a story to you?", question mark.

Q "LOL", is that texting lingo for "laugh out loud"?

A It is.

Q How did Dylan respond?

A "Yep."

Q How did you interpret that whole exchange? What did you interpret that to mean?

A As I previously stated, that Gina was trying to -- was bringing this story back to market.

Q And that she had contacted Dylan Howard about it?

A Yes.

Q Now, did there come a point in time in which interest in the Stormy Daniels story increased?

A Yes.

Q Can you explain that a little bit?

A Um, well, in 2011, we know that The Dirty published their story. And I think I later learned that there was some other interest in 2011 from In Touch Magazine. Years went by. At least five years went by until that last text message with Dylan. Um, and, really, there was very little -- to Gina's dissatisfaction, very little interest in the story publishing or in the marketability of the story. Um, this -- this continued through the Summer from what I understand. I was not involved. But, through the Summer into the Fall, where there was still being very little interest, despite the fact that Mr. Trump's notoriety was gaining.

Q Directing your attention to October 7th -- excuse me -- of 2016. Did you come to learn about the release of something that's known as the Access Hollywood tape?

A Yes.

Q And, briefly, for the jury, what is the Access Hollywood tape?

A The Access Hollywood tape, from what I understand, was -- was what's called a hot mic, which is a microphone that's recording. Um, and I think the insinuation when you say "hot mic" is it's live and recording, but perhaps unknown to the person who is mic'd. So, this was an incident where Donald Trump and Billy Bush was in the van. They were on the set of Access Hollywood, or it was released by Access Hollywood. I don't even know. There was an allegation that -- at least a record -- the hot mic recorded some statements by both men, um, that were troublesome.

Q What impact, if any, did the release of the Access Hollywood tape have on interest in Stormy Daniels' story, so far as you were aware?

A So far as I'm aware, it had tremendous influence.

Q Can you explain that a little bit to the jury, please?

A Before -- yes. Before Access Hollywood tape, there was very little, if any interest, from what I understand, and Gina was trying to sell the Stormy Daniels/Donald Trump story. It wasn't until Access Hollywood that interest sort of reached a crescendo.

Q So, going back to People's 176A in evidence, specifically on Page 1761, Lines 482 to 494. Is this another text exchange between you and Dylan Howard on October 8th and October 9th of 2016?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

A Yes.

Q Who sent the first text in this chain?

A It's from me.

Q And what did you say?

A "Trump is F'd."

Q You wrote the whole word out, "F'd", in the text?

A I did.

Q What prompted you to say that Trump was "F'd"?

A The Access Hollywood tape.

Q How did Dylan Howard respond?

A He responded with a: "Wave the white flag. It's over people!", explanation point.

Q And how did you interpret that?

A I think he was seconding my opinion.

Q Based on the Access Hollywood tape?

A Yes.

Q What did you say after that?

A Well, this is the next day. It looks like from Keith to Dylan: "Hi, the story is already out there."

Q And did you send that along with a link to The Dirty.com?

A Yes.

Q Is that the same article in Dirty dot com which you had successfully removed five years earlier?

A Yes. They republished the same article.

Q After the Access Hollywood tape?

A Yes.

Q What did Dylan say at that point?

A His response on October 9th was: "Yeah" -- excuse me. "Yeah, but her talking and taping blank is the final nail in the coffin. Dot dot dot. But he's -- he's fucked already."

Q What did you mean by that?

A That was Dylan who was the author of that.

Q I'm sorry. What did you understand that to mean?

A That The Dirty post was bad, but it could get a lot worse.

Q How could it get a lot worse?

A If she made comment.

Q In other words, The Dirty.com story was kind of a third-party account; that would be different from one of the participants in a sexual encounter publicly revealing the details of that?

A Precisely.

Q Then, how did you respond to that?

A "He really is."

Q Now, around that time, did you become involved in negotiating a deal on behalf of Stormy Daniels?

A No.

Q Okay. Did you work on a deal involving Stormy Daniels?

A Ultimately, I did.

Q Well, how did that come about?

A (No response).

Q You should explain whatever hesitation you have here.

A Gina, after the Access Hollywood tape, she went directly to Dylan and negotiated a deal with Dylan, outside of me. I had nothing to do with that deal. And I believe they came to terms.

Q I'm sorry?

A I believe they came to terms.

Q Did there come a time when you spoke with Dylan Howard about the Stormy Daniels story?

A Yes.

Q And how did that conversation go?

A I don't -- I don't recall. Other than what has already been displayed.

Q Okay. So, let me show you People's 178A in evidence.

MR. STEINGLASS: So everyone can see it.

Q I'm going to ask you, do you recognize this?

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

A Yes.

Q And is this a record of texts among yourself, Michael Cohen and Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q Did you answer that?

A Yes. It is a record of texts between the three of us.

MR. STEINGLASS: Can we just un-blow it up for one second?

Q How many texts are in this chain?

A Two.

MR. STEINGLASS: Now we can blow it back up. Thank you.

Q What is the date of these two texts?

A October 10th.

Q Of 2016?

A Yes.

Q And what is said during this text exchange?

A This is authored by Dylan:  "Keith, slash, Michael. Connecting you both in regards to that business opportunity. Spoke to the client this AM and they're confirmed to proceed with the opportunity. Thanks. Dylan."

Q What did you understand that to mean?

A Well, prior to this text, like I said, Gina and Dylan had come to terms on an agreement that AMI had agreed to purchase this story for $120,000. Dylan and AMI backed out of that deal. It sort of fell apart. And Gina -- excuse me -- Dylan asked Gina to call Michael Cohen and finish the deal with him. And Gina refused. So, she asked me to call Cohen. And I refused. And then Dylan called me to convince me to call Cohen.

Q So, can we just break that down?

A Sure.

Q Though you didn't use pronouns, so that was helpful.

A The moral of the story was:  No one wanted to talk to Cohen.

Q Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the People and some jurors laugh.

Q Can you walk us through that a little more slowly, that Cohen got involved in this deal, notwithstanding the fact that Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard had already negotiated the deal?

A So, the Access Hollywood tape dropped. Gina and Dylan came to terms at 120,000. Dylan backed out, which left that deal up in the air. AMI did not want to complete the deal or would not complete the deal. And Dylan asked Gina to call Cohen and close the deal with him. Gina refused, and asked me to call Cohen on behalf of Stormy and close the deal that had already been agreed to.

Q So, Dylan sends this text, and then Dylan sends another text?

A Yes.

Q What was the other text?

A "Over to the two of you."

Q Actually, it says: "Over to you two"?

A "Over to you two."

Q Who did you understand "you two" to mean?

A Michael Cohen and I.

Q Going back to that first text for a moment, what did you understand Dylan to be saying when he said: "Spoke to the client this AM and they're confirmed to proceed with the opportunity"?

A That he spoke to either Gina or Gina and Stormy, and that they were confirmed to proceed. He -- Dylan was washing his hands of the deal and sort of handing the deal over to -- first, Gina to close; and then she didn't want to do that; and, ultimately, me to close with Cohen.

Q What was your understanding of Michael Cohen's interest in the matter?

A I believe that -- I believe that Michael Cohen was personal attorney or general counsel for Donald Trump, and that this story involved his client, and that was his interest in the story.

Q Was it it unusual -- withdrawn. You said you had known Dylan Howard for years?

A Yes.

Q And you had other business interactions with Dylan Howard?

A Yes.

Q Was it unusual for Dylan Howard to connect you to someone outside of AMI to purchase a story?

A I think this is the only time that ever happened.

Q So, did there come a time, after this, that you spoke with Michael Cohen about the Stormy Daniels story?

A Yes.

Q And do you remember -- withdrawn. Tell us how that conversation went.

A Well, it was different than 2011. Um. And, it was fairly conciliatory. The deal had already been cut at $120,000. And -- then, um, we -- we needed to pad the deal, um, to compensate me now, because I was added to the deal, and Stormy and Gina weren't gonna take a discount for involving me. So, that 120 became 130.

Q So, when you say the deal is already cut at $120,000, it was cut between Stormy Daniels and AMI; right?

A Yes.

Q Was this the same deal in your mind, a different deal? How --

A It was the same deal. They were going to acquire the intellectual property rights in this story, exclusive rights.

Q But, instead of AMI purchasing it, it was now Michael Cohen, on behalf of Donald Trump?

A Well, after AMI washed their hands of the deal and then they handed it -- handed it -- AMI handed it off to Cohen, they -- in essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes.

Q And at the time that you got involved, had Michael Cohen already stepped into AMI's shoes?

A I believe so.

Q Did you negotiate -- withdrawn. Did you -- you said you had to "pad the deal" so that you could get compensated; is that right?

A Yes.

Q How did you "pad the deal" so you could get compensated?

A Gina approached me. She said, "Hey, can we have this deal?"  She said, "It's going to be the easiest deal you've ever done in your entire life."  (Laughs). "It's already been negotiated. It's already done. All you need to do is paper it and talk to that asshole Cohen."

Q That's what Gina said?

A Yes.

Q And did you know when you were dealing with Michael Cohen that you were dealing with Donald Trump?

A Yes. I never thought otherwise.

Q And how did you change the terms of the deal that had previously been negotiated between Gina and Dylan Howard so that you would be compensated now that the deal was between Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen?

A I think a little of that happened even before my involvement, and there was a -- when Dylan washed his hands of it, um, he and Gina had a conversation. And -- and Gina said, "Well, look, we already have a deal of 120. If I need to bring a lawyer into this, our net is going to be reduced." And Dylan said, "Don't worry about it. We'll make the deal or Cohen will make the deal 150,000." And then Gina called me, engaged me. I called Cohen and picked it up.

Q And what was the price that you agreed on with Michael Cohen?

A So, the 150 wasn't really true. Um, it turned out to be 130. So, it was the original 120, plus 10,000.

Q I am now showing you People's Exhibit 63 in evidence. I'm going to display Page 1.

MR. STEINGLASS: This is in evidence. Everyone can see it.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, an exhibit is shown on the screens.

Q Do you recognize this?

A Yes.

Q What is it?

A This is an email from me to Michael Cohen.

Q And what is the date of this email from you to Michael Cohen?

A October 11, 2016.

Q Did the email contain attachments?

A Yes.

Q Are those attachments listed where it says "attachments"?

A Yes.

Q What were the attachments to the email?

A Side Letter Agreement; Confidential Settlement Agreement, and my firm's wiring instructions, bank wiring instructions.

Q Who were the parties to the Settlement Agreement?

A It was Stormy Daniels on one side and -- you see the subject line "SD"?

Q Yes.

A Stormy Daniels versus RCI.

Q What's "RCI"?

A "RCI" was an LLC that Michael told me he was going to use to pay for this deal.

Q Do you know what that -- off the top of your head, do you remember what that stands for?

A Resolution Consultants Incorporated, I believe.

Q Now, did the settlement use pseudonyms?

A Yes.

Q What was Stormy Daniels' pseudonym?

A "Peggy Peterson".

Q What was Donald Trump's pseudonym?

A I think it was "David Dennison".

Q Who came up with those pseudonyms?

A I did.

Q How?

A I used PP because she was the plaintiff, and DD because he was the defendant.

Q Is David Dennison a real person?

A He was on my high school hockey team.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, people laugh.

Q How does he feel about you now?

A He's very upset.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, people laugh.

Q Now, one of the attachments that you mentioned was called a Side Letter Agreement, I believe you said?

A Yes.

Q What's a Side Letter Agreement?

A The Side Letter Agreement is an addendum to an underlying contract, and, um, it has terms to the original contract.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, Senior Court Reporter Theresa Magniccari relieves Senior Court Report Laurie Eisenberg, and the transcript continues on the following page.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: The following proceedings are continued from previous page.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q. And is what was the purpose of using a side letter agreement with this particular deal?

A. The Side Letter Agreement -- the purpose for using a Side Letter Agreement, it uses like code words that are used in a military-like operation, so it ensures the further confidentiality in case a fully executed contract was lost or stolen. So even if that occurred, you wouldn't lose the confidential nature of the document. So the Side Letter Agreement is typically used in these cases to identify the identity of the true parties involved. And it's really for attorneys' eyes only.

Q. Okay. So, just to be clear, who were the two parties to this agreement, whose names, whose identities were being protected?

A. Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump.

Q. One of the attachments also to this email -- withdrawn. What did you say in the body of the email in which you transmitted these documents? Let's start with Paragraph 1.

A. Paragraph 1?

Q. Yes.

A. Would you like me to read it?

Q. Please.

A. "Please fund Ms. Daniels' settlement agreement and Side Letter Agreement attached." "I have notified in the Side Letter Agreement (SLA)

A. which identities the parties to this agreement." "Under the terms of the agreement, neither my client nor I are entitled to possession of the Side Letter Agreement." That's Paragraph 1.

Q. I am sorry.

A. That's Paragraph 1.

Q. So why were you as the lawyer not entitled to keep a copy?

A. Michael Cohen demanded that only he retain a copy of the Side Letter Agreement.

Q. Is that unusual?

A. Yes.

Q. Paragraph 2, please?

A. "The settlement sum is $130,000. I have also attached my firm's wiring instructions for your reference."

Q. Is that the clause that contains the payment being made to Stormy Daniels?

A. Yes.

Q. And does that sum of $130,000 include your fee and Gina Rodriguez's fee?

A. Yes, the gross. That's the gross. Yes.

Q. Okay. Thank you. Paragraph 3.

A. "Ms. Daniels expressed dissatisfaction with your schedule of a delay of ten days for funding." "To that end, you'll see that I placed this Friday, 10/14/16, as the funding deadline. Let me know if there is a problem."

Q. What is a funding deadline?

A. Well, the contract called for payment, a settlement sum, and the funding deadline to which it must be funded.

Q. Did you actually receive payment from anyone on the Trump side on October 14, 2016?

A. We did not.

Q. Do you know why not?

A. No.

Q. I'm showing you People's Exhibit 64 in evidence. Do you recognize this?

A. Yes.

Q. Is this an email -- withdrawn. What is this?

A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen.

Q. On what day?

A. October 12, 2016.

Q. What does it say on the subject line?

A. "Daniels."

Q. And just zooming back out for a minute. If we were to read this exhibit chronologically, would we start at the bottom?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's start at the bottom. Can you describe what is said in this exchange?

A. "We good."

Q. Who said that?

A. I did.

Q. And how did Michael Cohen respond?

A. Yes. It's Yom Kippur, so the office is closed for all purposes. I will start over. "Yes, it's Yom Kippur so the office is for all purposes closed. I am in tomorrow, but I can speak for the next three hours via cell, if necessary."

Q. How, if at all, did you respond to that?

A. Because it was a holiday, I didn't feel the need to speak that day. I said:  "It was not necessary to speak today." You should have all the -- "you should have all the executed documents a few days ago. Talk to you tomorrow."

Q. When you wrote the "executed documents," was that a reference to the signed attachments that you sent the day before that were part of People's 63 that we just saw?

A. Yes.

Q. Showing you People's 65 in evidence. Do you recognize this?

A. Yes.

Q. What is this?

A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen on October 14, 2016.

Q. And, among other things, are you re-forwarding the email from October 11th, which included all those attachments we just described?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it include the wiring instructions for a second time?

A. Yes.

Q. Why did you resend the documents?

A. Well, after the Yom Kippur email, which I at some point began to think is an excuse for failure to fund -- there were other excuses. And the other excuses included, you know, for example, well, Yom Kippur, and included the fact that he didn't have my wiring instructions. So I re-forwarded him the wiring instructions.

Q. Okay. I am now showing you People's Exhibit 281 in evidence. Do you recognize this?

A. Yes.

Q. Is this -- what is this?

A. This is an email from me to Michael Cohen, dated October 17, 2016.

Q. And what is the subject line?

A. "PP versus DD. Important."

Q. And what does "PP" and "DD" refer to?

A. The pseudonyms that we used in the Settlement Agreement.

Q. Peggy Peterson and David Dennison?

A. Yes.

Q. You told us, I think, the date of the email was what?

A. October 17, 2016.

Q. And what was the domain of the email address that you used for Michael Cohen when you sent this email?

A. TrumpOrg.com.

Q. Can you please read the email?

A. "Michael, I have been charged by my client with forwarding the below message. We have a written Settlement Agreement which calls for settlement payment to be made by the end of business this past Friday, October 14, 2016. No payment was received." Next paragraph:  "We spoke on Friday October 14, you stated that the funds would be wired today, October 17, 2016. No funds have been received as of the sending of this email." Next paragraph:  "My client informs me that she intends to cancel the settlement contract if no funds are received by 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Please call me if you have any questions." "Keith."

Q. What prompted you to send this email?

A. Their failure to meet the funding deadline repeatedly and being met with a barrage of excuses as to why they had failed.

Q. In addition to these emails back and forth between yourself and Michael Cohen, were you also speaking with him on the phone during this period?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us, in general, every conversation -- can you tell us, in general, what those conversations were like?

A. They were rather conciliatory, but it was sort of circular arguments. It was excuses. It was contradictions. Things that he was saying didn't make sense from one conversation to the next. Again, the contradictions just didn't leave me with a comfort level that there was a true intention to fund the deal.

Q. Do you remember any of the other excuses that he gave you?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell us some?

A. He stated that the computer systems were "all fucked up." He stated, "You can't believe what we're going through. The Secret Service is in here. They have so many goddamn fire walls. I can't get shit. It's not my fault. You're going to have to resend the agreements again. I never got your emails." Even though he previously told me he received them and the wiring instructions. I think that's it for this period of time that I can recall.

Q. Did he ever make reference to Mr. Trump's whereabouts?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you remember him saying about that?

A. I called him and said:  Michael, this is a very bad situation. I have a client and her rep Gina who is very upset. It's making me look bad. And I don't believe really a word that you are saying. And then he said:  Well, goddamn it, what do you expect me to do?  My guy is in five fucking states today or three or four or five different states today. There is nothing I can do. I am doing everything I can.

Q. When he said that "his guy" was in a certain number of states, who did you understand "his guy" to be making reference to?

A. Donald Trump.

Q. And what was the relevance based on your conversation with Michael Cohen about -- what was the relevance of the fact that Mr. Trump was in three or four or five different states?

A. What did that mean to me?

Q. What did it mean to you?

A. To me it was similar -- it's a situation I run into all the time. It was similar to like someone who doesn't have the purse strings. It's like an attorney has to go call an insurance adjuster. Like that. Michael Cohen didn't have the authority to actually spend money despite the fact there has been so many excuses and funding deadlines that have already been missed.

Q. You believe that Michael Cohen didn't have the authority to spend the money?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he at some point say something to you about what he would do to get the money?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say?

A. Well, I think you can tell by these emails that I was sending him there was a great level of frustration by me and my client -- clients and her rep. I let him know that the level of dissatisfaction was quite high. And he stated, "Goddamn it, I'll just do it myself."

Q. What did you understand him to mean when he said, "I'll just do it myself?"

A. That he would not seek authority to consummate the deal -- excuse me -- fund the deal. It was consummated with a signature. He would waive the authority in order to fund.

Q. Did you ever believe that Michael Cohen was going to be the ultimate source of the funds?

A. Never, never prior to funding, no.

Q. Even after he said, "I'll just do it myself," where did you understand the money would be coming from?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. From Donald Trump or some corporate affiliation thereof.

Q. Okay. So I am going to show you People's 282 in evidence. Is this another email from you to Michael Cohen?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is the date and subject line?

A. October 17, 2016.

Q. And the subject?

A. "PP versus DD. Important."

Q. And the body of the email?

A. "Please be advised that my client deems her Settlement Agreement cancelled and void Ab initio."

Q. And who did you mean by "my client?"

A. Stormy Daniels.

Q. And what does "Ab initio" mean?

A. It's a Latin term used in the law for void, I believe. Void from the beginning of time, as if it never occurred at all.

Q. Why did you tell Michael Cohen that you no longer represented Stormy Daniels in this deal or any other matter?

A. It was two-fold. One:  Because I divested myself of the case. And, two:  Because I didn't want to keep -- I didn't want to receive a million frustrating phone calls from Michael. He created this drama and this situation.

Q. Did you communicate with Stormy Daniels and/or Gina Rodriguez around this time?

A. Yes.

Q. Which one?

A. Both.

Q. And what was the nature of that conversation?

A. I let them know that -- well, even leading up to this, I let them know that -- well, they wanted frequent updates. I would like to start over.

Q. Go ahead.

A. They wanted frequent updates and they received frequent updates. The only updates I could give them were the repeated excuses that I was hearing. That was a great source of frustration. And then when push came to shove, this is really -- this email that's displayed is the straw that broke the camel's back. This is where push came to shove. This is when I said, hey, this deal is over. And I said to both Cohen and to my client, "I'm out. Go in peace."

Q. During either that conversation, or another conversation with Stormy Daniels and/or Gina Rodriguez, did they express to you any views about what was happening here?

A. I'm not going to answer that question based on attorney/client privilege.

Q. Fair enough. Let me ask you this:  Do you believe that you represented Gina in this matter as well?

A. I don't mean to parse words, but I viewed Gina's role in this situation as that of a manager, which would make her a legal agent to my client Stormy Daniels. So if I was talking to Gina, it was if I was talking to my client and the privilege would exist.

Q. All right. Did there come a time when you resumed your involvement, notwithstanding this email, in the deal between Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump?

A. Yes.

Q. How did that come about?

A. I don't have a specific recollection.

Q. Do you remember talking with Dylan Howard at any point during this period of where you believed you were getting excuses from Michael Cohen?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us about that conversation or conversations that you had with Dylan Howard?

A. I recall having conversations with Dylan where I would express that I believed Cohen was not being truthful.

Q. When you say you believed you expressed to Dylan that Cohen was not being truthful, not being truthful about what?

A. About his excuses for failure to fund.

Q. What did you think was really happening?

A. What did I think was really happening?

Q. Yes, in terms of Michael Cohen's failure to fund. What did you believe was really happening?

A. I thought he was trying to kick the can down the road until after the election.

MR. STEINGLASS: Are we taking an afternoon break?  If so, this would be a good time.

THE COURT: All right; I will see you at 10 to 4.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury leaving courtroom.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness leaving courtroom.

THE COURT: Just give me a sense. I am not rushing you.

MR. STEINGLASS: An hour and a half.

THE COURT: I will see you at 10 to 4.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Recess.

THE CLERK: Continued case on trial, People versus Donald J. Trump.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Witness entering courtroom.

THE COURT: Let's get the jury.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Jury entering courtroom.

THE COURT: Continuing case on trial, People versus Donald J. Trump. All parties and all jurors are present.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q. Good afternoon again, Mr. Davidson.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. I am going to show you People's 176A again. Specifically, Page 10, lines 500 to 503. Is this the text exchange between yourself and Dylan Howard?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is the date of these texts?

A. October 17, 2016.

Q. Through?

A. October 18, 2016.

Q. Okay. So who is the first text in this particular exchange from?

A. This is from Dylan to me.

Q. What does it say?

A. "Cohen texting me if I have reached Gina." I said:  "She's not taking my calls again. I want distance." He writes back:  "You're kidding me. One way they can settle this impending storm."

Q. What did you understand this to mean?

A. That Cohen was leaning on Dylan to placate Gina.

Q. And -- withdrawn. Okay. Did you respond?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you respond?

A. "I can't believe Cohen let this go. It's going to be a shit show."

Q. What did you mean by that?

A. Once I divested myself from the case and Gina and Stormy were -- I think they were going to publicize the matter.

Q. When you say "publicize the matter," you mean through a different media outlet?

A. Or many.

Q. Or many different media outlets. So, specifically, what did you mean when you said "it's going to be a shit show?"

A. I just felt like it was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt it would be a tornado.

Q. When the story got out, if the story got out?

A. Yes.

Q. What did Dylan Howard say in response, if anything?

A. "Did they do the deal?"

Q. And what did you understand that to mean?

A. I think that Gina and Stormy had another deal, a backup deal in the wings, and he was asking if they closed that secondary deal.

Q. "He," being Dylan Howard?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you respond?

A. "That's what I hear. I think it will be a full on blitz."

Q. What did you mean by that?

A. That there would be tremendous media activity around the subject of the story.

Q. Now, again, without getting into the substance of privileged conversations, would you say you were talking during this period more with Gina Rodriguez or more with Stormy Daniels or about the same?

A. I think overall I was talking to Gina, overall, 85 percent of the time. When things got really heated, Stormy participated more, but I think around this time it was probably just Gina.

Q. Okay. Moving onto Page 11, entries 504 to 506. I think, continuing this exchange, how did Dylan respond?

A. "I bet."

Q. And -- withdrawn. Did he then send a follow up?

A. He did.

Q. And what did he say?

A. I am quoting Dylan, he said:  "All because Trump is tight."

Q. What did you understand that to mean?

A. That Mr. Trump was frugal.

Q. What relevance did this have to the conversation that you were having with Dylan, Mr. Trump's frugality?

A. That they had this deal on a silver platter. It was there for the taking. It didn't close. The only way it doesn't close is because it didn't fund. The only reason it didn't fund is because they didn't want to spend the money.

Q. During your dealings with Michael Cohen, did he tell you who he was representing in these negotiations?

A. I don't think -- every single time I talked to Michael Cohen, he leaned on his close affiliation with Donald Trump. I don't know if it was ever explicitly said, "I am negotiating this  matter on behalf of Donald Trump," it was part of his identity and he let me know it every opportunity he could, that he was working for Donald Trump.

Q. And when you were negotiating the settlement agreement with Michael Cohen, did you have an understanding of who was ultimately going to be responsible for paying Ms. Daniels?

A. No.

Q. Let me show you privately Grand Jury Page 525. I believe that's People's Exhibit 508A. I am going to ask you, just yourself and the parties and the Judge --

MR. BOVE: I object to this.

THE COURT: Approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:

MR. BOVE: The last question was:  Do you have an understanding of who was going to be ultimately responsible?  I am summarizing. The answer is no. The witness didn't indicate there was any lack of recollection. Now we're basically -- the People's witness -- impeaching their testimony. Either way, it should not be put in front of him right now. The answer is the answer. It should stand.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. STEINGLASS: I am deliberately not violating Penal Law 60.35 by not asking him the substance of the previous communication. I am showing it to him to refresh his recollection without disclosing the content.

THE COURT: He hasn't stated he needs his recollection refreshed. You haven't asked him. So your objection is sustained.

MR. BOVE: He's been precise about refreshing his recollection. He did not have such an understanding. It would be improper to go back and say --

THE COURT: Let's see if it does.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

THE COURT: Your objection is sustained. Can you please read back the last question.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the Official Court Reporter read back the referred-to-question.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q. Mr. Davidson, have you previously testified about this point in the Grand Jury in this case?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

A. Yes.

Q. Would reviewing that testimony help refresh your recollection about your answer to that question?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled. Please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:

MR. BOVE: This is what I was concerned about at the end of the last sidebar. The witness has not indicated that he has a lack of recollection. To ask a leading question to try to drive him to say, yes, I do have an absence of recollection so it could be refreshed, that is improper. The answer should stand.

MR. STEINGLASS: The whole point, how should I find out if he needs his recollection refreshed or ask him?

THE COURT: He hasn't said he could have his recollection refreshed. He gave an answer. That's his answer.

MR. STEINGLASS: I don't know if this is appropriate, but, you know, the fact that there was a very long pause between the answer that he gave and the question that I asked, that is part of why I am seeing if something could refresh his recollection. I could acknowledge that he gave the answer.

THE COURT: You could go back and ask.

MR. STEINGLASS: I can do that.

THE COURT: Just in fairness, Mr. Bove, you might have a few times yourself --

MR. BOVE: In the context where I get to lead the witness.

THE COURT: That's true.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

THE COURT: Okay. The objection is sustained.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q. Mr. Davidson, I notice when I asked you that last question about what your understanding was about who was going to be ultimately responsible, you paused before you gave your answer; is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that pause -- is that pause any indication that you might want to have your recollection refreshed?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained to form.

Q. As you sit here --

A. Can I have the question read back?

Q. Which question?  It was sustained. I don't think it can be read back. Let me ask a different question. Is there a question that I asked that you are unclear about what I was asking?

A. I believe so.

Q. So a few questions ago I asked the question:  When you were negotiating the Settlement Agreement with Michael Cohen, did you have an understanding of who was ultimately going to be responsible for paying Ms. Daniels. Is that the question that you wanted to be read back?

A. Yes.

Q. That one, you could answer that, there is no objection. How would you answer that?

A. I find that question confusing.

Q. Sorry. Let me see if I could clarify. Who were you negotiating with -- withdrawn. Is your problem my use of the word "negotiating;"  is that a big problem?

A. No.

Q. When you were dealing with Michael Cohen --

A. Yes.

Q. -- did you have an understanding of how this deal was going to be funded?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I had an assumption.

MR. BOVE: Objection. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Did Michael Cohen say anything to you during the negotiations that led you to believe that there was someone other than Michael Cohen who was funding this transaction?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. What pauses your uncertainty on this?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. A few moments ago we saw a text in which you and Dylan Howard were discussing the fact that you perceived Mr. Trump as being frugal?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember giving that answer?

A. Yes.

Q. What about Mr. Trump's frugality is relevant to this exchange that you were having with Mr. Dylan Howard?

A. It was my understanding that Mr. Trump was the beneficiary of this contract and that in the overwhelming majority of cases the beneficiary of the contract is the one who funds it.

MR. BOVE: Objection. Move to strike the last part.

THE COURT: Sustained. The answer is stricken.

Q. So what did you an attribute the lack of funding of the deal at this point?

A. Frugality.

Q. Whose frugality?

MR. BOVE: Objection. May I be heard at sidebar?

THE COURT: Yes, please approach.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:

MR. BOVE: Thank you for hearing me, Judge. My objection is that we've now endeavored to attack this several different ways. Each of them has been inadmissible. We're now in a place where this is asked and answered several times over, and I think that the Government should be required to move on from here.

MR. STEINGLASS: It actually hasn't been answered. It has been asked. It has been sustained every which way. I believe the last way is a way that might not be objectionable.

THE COURT: I agree with, Mr. Bove. It's time to move on.

MR. STEINGLASS: Okay.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Whereupon, the following proceedings were held in open court:

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. STEINGLASS:

Q. Going back to Page 11. I am going to blow up some texts in the interim between 507 and 512. This is again People's 176 in evidence. Did these texts -- actually, can we get the few texts that happened right before it as well, please. So at the top of the page, second down, we see the line you have already told us, "Because Trump is tight;" is that right, from Dylan?

A. Talking with Dylan, yes.

Q. You said, "Yep;" is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. What does Dylan say?

A. "I reckon that Trump impersonator I hired has more cash."

Q. What did you interpret that to mean?

A. Yeah.

Q. What did you interpret that to mean?

A. That Trump wasn't as wealthy as he stated.

Q. And what is -- what is the relevance of that observation?

A. I think that was a followup to Dylan's text where he says, "Trump is tight."

Q. So, moving on, do you see a few lines down.

MR. STEINGLASS: I am going to ask you, please, to blow up lines 513 to 519.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. And what do we see here?  What date is this?  Who is talking?

A. I can't read the exhibit.

Q. We will blow it back up for you in a second.

A. From the top?

Q. Yes.

A. This is October 25, 2016, from Dylan Howard:  "Going to see Pecker in 15. Will ask for an update. Any word?"

Q. And did you respond to that?

A. "Yes."

Q. And what did you say?

A. "I'm awaiting a call any second."

Q. Who were you awaiting a call from, if you remember?

A. I don't remember.

Q. What did you understand Dylan Howard to mean when he said, "Going to see Pecker in 15, will ask for an update?"

A. I think Dylan or AMI was attempting to resurrect the Stormy Daniels deal.

Q. Okay. How did Dylan Howard respond?

A. The third text down?

Q. Yes.

A. "Okay."

Q. Did he send another text?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is the next text? Is this still on October 25th?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say?

A. "It's like he is telling me what he wrote to someone else."

Q. Maybe if you could read the text first, then I will ask you how you interpret it.

A. I wrote:  "Keep calling you urgently. Period. We have to coordinate something on the matter he is calling you about, or it could look awful for everyone."

Q. You started to tell us what you understood this to mean?

A. Yes. I think that this, he is forwarding me a text that he wrote to Michael Cohen.

Q. Were you, in fact, trying to reach Michael Cohen yourself at this point?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. I'm going to privately show you what's been marked for identification as People's Exhibit 337.

MR. BOVE: Same objection with the Grand Jury testimony.

THE COURT: No speaking objections.

MR. STEINGLASS: This is just for the witness, the parties, and the court.

Q. Do you recognize this document?

MR. BOVE: Objection, Judge.

THE COURT: Sustained. The objection is sustained.

Q. So going back to People's 176A, after that last text, does Dylan Howard send another text?

A. Yes.

Q. What is that text?

A. "Push for the cash. D.P. and I told him he has to pay the $150."

Q. What did you understand that to mean?

A. That in the context of what is on the screen there was an attempt to resurrect this deal that had once fallen apart. That AMI had divested itself from the deal, but they were encouraging Cohen to deal directly with me, and that I should try to get as much as I could, up to $150,000.

Q. And who did you understand "D.P." to be a reference to?

A. David Pecker.

Q. So when you say "resurrect the deal," the deal between whom?

A. Well, the Stormy Daniels deal, but the party on the other side of the deal from Stormy had changed. It changed from AMI to Cohen or his corporate entity.

Q. So when you said "resurrect the deal," are you speaking that you interpreted this as resurrecting AMI's deal with Stormy Daniels or resurrecting Michael Cohen and his entity's deal with Stormy Daniels?

MR. BOVE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Which deal are you talking about resurrecting, which deal are you interpreting this as a deal to resurrect?

A. The Stormy Daniels deal.

Q. But who is on the other side?

A. That is what had changed.

Q. It had changed from what to what?

A. From AMI to Cohen.

Q. Okay. And keep going, please. What is the next?

A. The next text is from me to Dylan. He says, "You said you're paying."

Q. So, he says, "You said you're paying?"

A. Yes.

Q. Who is meant by "he?"

A. Michael Cohen.

Q. So does this mean at some point during this text exchange you had a conversation with Michael Cohen?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us a little bit about that conversation, whatever you remember?

A. Yes, it was very frustrating. The entire matter was very frustrating that it was on again and off again. That there were delays in funding, cancellations, disengaging from the client, reengaging with the client, Stormy and Gina. Then Dylan sort of as a peacemaker, sort of brought me back into the fold. He said he reached out to Pecker, and that everything was teed up. And then Dylan tells me:  Push for the cash. And then basically tells me to call Cohen. Then when I call Cohen, he says:  I'm not paying anything, AMI is paying. It was just one more snafu.

Q. How did you respond to Dylan Howard?

A. "I am sorry."

Q. You said you sent that text:  "He says you're paying?"

A. Yes.

Q. Did you then send another text?

A. Yes. "Call whenever."

Q. Okay. I am now showing you People's 283 in evidence.

MR. STEINGLASS: Maybe load that top portion up.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. I am going to ask you, what is this document?

A. This is now the fourth or fifth time I sent my wiring instructions to Michael Cohen.

Q. And in this email, to which domain, email address did you use for Michael Cohen?

A. Gmail.com.

Q. And what was the subject line?

A. "Wiring instructions."

Q. And the date of this email?

A. October 26, 2016. This is now October 26, 2016.

Q. Thank you. What does the body of the email say?

A. There is no body of the email.

Q. Is there an attachment?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the attachment?

A. My wiring instructions.

MR. STEINGLASS: Can we see Page 2 in this exhibit.

AUDIO DESCRIPTION: Displayed.

Q. Is this, Page 2, is this the wiring instructions to wire money to your attorney/client trust account?

A. Yes.

Q. What made you resend these instructions?

A. Cohen's repeated assertion that he didn't have my wiring instructions despite the fact they were repeatedly sent to him previously.

Q. I am now showing you People's 284 in evidence. Do you recognize this?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is this?

A. Michael Cohen had called me and said:  Hey, everything is A-okay. We got everything we need. You know we're sending you the money. So I told him that I didn't believe him, and he forwarded this email to me.

Q. And where was the email from that he was forwarding to you?

A. First Republic Bank.

Q. What was the subject line that he was forwarding to you?

A. "First Republic Bank Transfer."

Q. From which email address did he send this to you?

A. TrumpOrg.com.

Q. Does it look like he also forwarded it to his own Gmail account?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, does this -- can we look at the bottom. Does this appear to be a forwarded email?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was the original email, from whom to whom?

A. This is from, it looks like Liz Rappaport, assistant to Gary Farro -- to Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen.

Q. What is the date of that -- the date and time of that email being sent from Ms. Ms. Rappaport to Mr. Cohen?

A. I think this was 16 days after the original agreement was entered into:  October 16, 2016.

Q. What does the body say?

A. "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. The funds have been deposited into your checking account. Entered in 1897. Best, Lizzie."

Q. What did you take it to mean that Michael Cohen forwarded you to this email?

A. It meant nothing to me.

Q. Why not?

A. Because he had my wiring instructions, all he needed to do was wire funds, but he didn't wire funds, he forwarded me an email saying that he had the money, not that he sent the money to me.

Q. How would you describe Michael Cohen -- withdrawn. During this time, were you also speaking with Michael Cohen on the phone?

A. Yes.

Q. How would you describe his demeanor during this time?

A. He was highly excitable. Sort of a pants on fire kind of guy. He had a lot of things going on.  Frequently I would be on the phone with him, he would take another call, he would be talking out of two ears. Sort of like that movie with the dogs and squirrels.

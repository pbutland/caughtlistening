The Court finds that the People have met their burden of proof and demonstrated contempt as to the second and third incident, but not as to the first. Mr. Trump is fined a thousand dollars on each of those two. As to SMZ—71764 of '24, covering incidents 4 through 10, the Court finds the People have met their burden as to all of those. And the Court imposes a punishment of $1,000 on each of those six. I am handing down written decision copies for both sides. The details of the decision are in the written decision."

This is on 39551 is the line for that and is the third tab. So, as I believe your Honor has, and will continue to instruct the jury, the Rodriguez portions of —— Ms. Rodriguez is not alleged to be a co—conspirator in this case. So, her texts are only coming in to contextualize Dylan Howard's texts. And Dylan Howard clearly is a co—conspirator in this case. We have no problem with the limiting instructions. We are not trying to argue the truth of the statements contained in Ms. Rodriguez's texts, but they do contextualize, A, what was going on in terms of the transactions and the negotiations at the time, and also Mr. Howard's responses. of all of these three, we can, and I actually communicated this with Mr. Blanche, we can live without number one, if they feel so strongly about it.

And so, with the first one, there is just no —— there is just no necessary reason to include that for context. So, it's not being offered for the truth. The very small potential, you know, benefit of it providing context, in our view, is greatly outweighed by the potential for the jury to have confusion and take it for the wrong reason, even with a limited instruction. That is the exact same reason for the other one as well. If you read all the texts and with all the evidence that has been permitted about what's happening in that week, no context is necessary in that situation given the risks that they are going to —— the jury would take, very shady shit is going on, for improper reasons. Who knows why she said it. We can all guess and speculate, but that's why it shouldn't come in. And then the last, your Honor, look, we don't think it should come in at all. We certainly do not think the last sentence in the clause of the first sentence should come in at the end of it. So, yes, he is sending what she signed with Trump so we can get the story out with Fox this morning, and then no one will be afraid. And the Daily Mail is scared of Trump. I mean, that's a hearsay statement that provides no context to the rest of the text exchange. So, that's —— we did agree on virtually everything.

        "text": "Thank you, your Honor. The second matter relates to one of the Court's pretrial evidentiary rulings that the Court asked the People to re—raise at an appropriate point. We think now is not that point, but soon is the appropriate point. This relates to the People's request to introduce evidence regarding the defendant's attempt to dissuade witnesses, including Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, through a public pressure campaign, retaliation, harassing comments, including in public remarks and online. The Court originally held in its Order on the People's motions in limine, reserved the item pending an offer of proof. We made the offer of proof on April 15th. The Court held at that time that the evidence regarding the intimidation and pressure campaign was probative for multiple purposes, including the defendant's guilty conscious and to explain witnesses changing their position, but the Court excluded that evidence subject to the defense opening the door. And the Court —— I believe the Court said the issue might well be academic because the defense was likely to open the door. We believe the defense did, in fact, as your Honor predicted, open the door in opening statements last week, and they did so in the opening statement in several ways. Counsel stated that the evidence would show that Mr. Cohen was previously loyal and defended the defendant on television, publicly and privately. And then, after getting caught in 2018, Mr. Cohen made the decision to blame the defendant for his problems, and he is an admitted liar, and that's at pages 899 to 900. Defense counsel also said the evidence would show that Mr. Cohen's expected testimony can't be believed because his goal is to go on television and social media and his entire financial livelihood depends on attacking the defendant. The defense made a similar or same assertions as to Stormy Daniels, another expected witness, stating that the evidence would show that she previously denied an improper relationship in writing, and that she was now making a living off of the defendant by talking about her interactions with him, including through a book and a documentary. All of those assertions that defense counsel made in the opening statement about what the evidence would show regarding the credibility of those witnesses are precisely the kinds of arguments or assertions that your Honor predicted the defense would make and stated, would open the door to the People being allowed to elicit evidence regarding the defendant's efforts to keep them in the fold, keep Mr. Cohen in the fold originally, followed by subsequent harassment online. So we ask the Court —— I am sorry. When the Court made that ruling on April 15th, the Court said the People should bring this back to me if at any point you believe that the defense has opened the door. So we ask the Court, in light of the opening statements, to hold that the People may introduce evidence to offset the defense claim that these witnesses are somehow benefiting from their willingness to testify to explain why both witnesses initially denied certain facts and now acknowledge those facts and as evidence of the defendant's consciousness of guilt. Thank you."

That's different in kind than eliciting —— well, depending on what the questions will be, questions about a pressure campaign, because of public tweets or Truths by President Trump at the time, and presumably now. So, before we —— before your Honor rules, we would ask the People to proffer what it is, specifically, they intend to elicit from the witnesses or extrinsically prove regarding this and go from there."

The second purpose is to explain why both witnesses initially denied certain facts and have now acknowledged those facts. And the third purpose is as evidence of the defendant's consciousness of guilt. And if I can just direct your Honor's attention to the transcript —— to the transcript of the April 15th proceeding, starting at page 56. Your Honor already observed following the People's proffer of that evidence, quote, you can't dispute that virtually everything that you put up is probative of something to some degree, whether it is consciousness of guilt to explain Mr. Cohen's turnaround to offset allegations that the witness is somehow benefiting from this. So, your Honor recognized those purposes that the People should not elicit anything until the defense opened the door, and our point now is that it is clear that the opening statements opened the door wide."

So, your Honor, public statements, and the public statements, in particular, that we are thinking of are comments regarding Michael Cohen during early 2018, immediately after the FBI raid and seizure of his devices, and the raid of his homes, saying things like, some people may flip if they are put under pressure, but Michael Cohen is not that kind of person. Followed immediately after, he plead guilty in August of 2018, by other public statements that changed his tune entirely. Then he said things like, if anybody is looking for a good lawyer, Michael Cohen is not your person. I am paraphrasing. But it's in the tweets referring to Paul Manafort, and saying, Paul Manafort will never crack, unlike other people who will flip if the government puts them under pressure. So that's evidence of a coordinated effort to bolster the witness and to prevent him from cooperating by saying nice things about him publicly, and as soon as he began cooperating, attacking him, which is classic evidence of consciousness of guilt by intimidating and attacking a witness."

Consciousness of guilt would allow the People to say, how do you know that he is guilty, Ladies and Gentlemen? Well, look what he did on this day which shows consciousness of guilt. The idea that President Trump was somehow feeling guilty or consciousness of guilt about the indictment in this case, when he was speaking about Michael Cohen and pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York to crimes that Presidents Trump isn't charged with and never was charged with, doesn't work, right. Meaning that there are 34 counts here of falsifying business records. There is —— the statements that President Trump made at the time of leading up to, and at the time of Michael Cohen's guilty plea were not consciousness of guilt of anything happening in this courtroom. And the risk that the jury will hear that and use it for an improper purpose is huge, right. Is it frustrating to have your lawyer plead guilty and publicly say he is going to cooperate and testify against you? Of course. And similarly, statements along the way encouraging his lawyer not to is not surprising either. Consciousness of guilt is of a different order. Consciousness of guilt would be President Trump doing something as it relates to the charges in this case that would show his motivation for doing it was to cover something up that would show that he is guilty. So, with respect to the other proffered reasons for some of this testimony to counter financial benefits to Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels and to explain why they changed their story, that makes sense. And I think they are going to talk about that on direct, but consciousness of guilt is of a different order, in our view."

The question is as to what, what can you use that for. I agree that it opened the door, and you can use it to explain what I will describe as a lot of back and forth amongst the main witnesses. Also, you can use it to reply or explain that they have not made as much money as the defense would have people think. At this point, I don't believe that it really goes to consciousness of guilt.

It came to my attention that there may be a misunderstanding regarding the Order restricting extrajudicial statements and how it impacts upon Mr. Trump's right to testify at trial. I think it's important that I clear up any misunderstanding that might exist. I want to stress, Mr. Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify at trial, if that is what you decide to do after consultation with your attorneys. That is a constitutional right that cannot be denied or abrogated in any way. It is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed upon. Just as you have the absolute right not to testify, if that is what you decide to do after consultation with your lawyer. The Order is restricting extrajudicial statements. That does not prevent you from testifying in any way. It does not prohibit you from taking the stand, and it does not limit or minimize what you can say from the witness stand. In fact, as the name of the Order indicates, it only applies to extrajudicial statements; that is, statements that are made outside of court. It does not apply to statements made from the witness stand. Please let your attorneys know if you have any lingering doubts or questions that need to be clarified, and I will try to answer them for you."

        "text": "Sure. So we understand that the next witness is a summary witness and intends to get in a number of exhibits that we have —— business records —— foundational objections to for all of them. But then we have other objections for three of them, your Honor. So the first one, I can start with the business records exemption. So we understand that the proffered evidence include two Truths, alleged Truths by President Trump; a handful of tweets by President Trump; and a tweet by the Washington Post; and then a news article by the Washington Post. We believe there are hearsay problems with each of these exhibits without the proper business record foundation being laid. So with respect to the Truths, it may be that by a preponderance of the evidence, the statement —— that the Truth itself could be allowed into evidence without a statement of the defendant. But there is a lot of information on every tweet, for example, the name @realDonaldTrump, the time it was sent and other information, that's hearsay. And that hearsay, we don't believe, is admissible through just a summary witness who doesn't have any foundational expertise to talk about the basis for how the date is put on the tweet, how —— you know, the typical things that you would expect for any type of business records. The same thing with the Truths, your Honor, the same exact problem. There is content within the Truth that purportedly they will argue are President Trump's statements. But there is a lot of stuff in that exhibit that is pure hearsay, and it is an out—of—court statement that will be offered for the truth of the matter asserted: The date, the time, the handle. And without a proper foundation, we object to that coming in. The straight —— and the same is true of the Washington Post tweet for the same reasons. And the same is true of the Washington Post article for the same reasons. Separately, for three of the exhibits, putting aside the hearsay objection, we don't believe they should come into evidence. Turning first to 405A and B. 405A is the Washington Post article dated October 7, 2016 laying out the purported Access Hollywood tape. Your Honor's ruling a couple of different times, including from the motions in limine, about what would be and what would not be allowed in with respect to the Access Hollywood tape, the original ruling said no tape, but witnesses could testify about it at the beginning of the trial. There is now going to be an email introduced that has a transcript of a portion of that Access Hollywood tape. What the People want to introduce now under 405A is the full —— what amounts to a full transcript from the Washington Post article. And, sure, there can be an instruction that says it's not offered for the truth, but there are quotation marks around the entire article. And so, the danger of unfair prejudice is extreme in this situation. Remember, the only reason why the Access tape —— Hollywood Access tape is coming in at all in this trial, under the Court's ruling, is to show intent and motive and to show what —— how the campaign responded and why they responded the way it did. There is already a ton of evidence about, already, about the Access Hollywood tape from Mr. Pecker, from Mr. Davidson. I expect there will be a witness today that will testify extensively about the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape, even on the fringes, are allowed."

And the campaign, not surprisingly, reacted forcefully in articles, in statements, and then ultimately with this Truth. It had nothing to do with witnesses. And, by the way, there has been oral argument in D.C., there were briefings where the Prosecutors in D.C. suggested that this is one of the reasons why Protective Orders should be put in place and then later a Gag Order, but when pressed, there has been no proof to disprove that, so when the context of it comes into evidence here, there is no basis for it.

The inadmissibility rule was not a rule that was ever recognized. Several cases that we have cited has held the exact opposite in the analogous context of consular immunity. As we cited in other papers holding that evidence of otherwise immune conduct is nonetheless admissible in a trial regarding criminal conduct for non—immune acts. So, the testimony we intend to elicit involves statements by the Defendant, and there is no doctrine that would allow excluding it."

        "text": "I'm happy to. Look, I mean, I don't think this is a long argument. We very much object to President Trump being cross—examined on the findings of the Court earlier this week, for a couple of different reasons. The first one is that, you know, this is a trial where the jury sees you every day; and so, interjecting into the cross—examination of President Trump a finding by your Honor beyond a reasonable doubt of contempt raises —— and there are a lot of reasons that would go into explaining it that, obviously, President Trump would have to talk about. It puts a layer on top of the testimony that, really, the risk of prejudice, because it's in this courtroom with your Honor, is greater than it is —— than it would otherwise be. And, more importantly, or as importantly, for many of the contempt findings —— the repost, for example, we're appealing. We accept the Order of the Court. There is no case law that suggests that was a violation. The Court noted that. There is a lot that went into those reposts and a lot of process that went into that. The finding of contempt is what it is. But, to be able to cross—examine President Trump on that, if he takes the stand, just invites this whole sideshow that the People don't need . And, especially, because they're already getting what your Honor has already ruled, that if President Trump testifies, he can be cross—examined on a prior finding by a different Judge, in a different court on this issue. So, to the extent that the People want to expose President Trump and cross examine him on that issue, they're going to do it. For those reasons, we do not think it's appropriate to allow the People to cross—examine President Trump."

        "text": "Thank you. On the last point that Mr. Blanche just raised, as your Honor noted in your original Sandoval ruling, the Court analysis is not bound by the number of the defendant's prior convictions. That's People v. Gray. And, so, in fact, the Courts have discretion to permit inquiry into the defendant's entire criminal history. Here, the Court's findings of nine criminal contempts are directly relevant to the defendant's credibility. They're finding that the defendant intentionally violated the Court Order. Both the Court of Appeals and the First Department have expressly held that contempt findings are appropriate and allowable. Sandoval evidence of the case —— I am thinking of People v. Grant, where the Court of Appeals held that a prior criminal contempt conviction bears heavily on the issues of veracity, since a person who wilfully violates may logically be presumed to be, similarly, willing to violate his obligation to tell the truth, despite his having made a promise to the Court to testify honestly. That is 7 NY 3d 421. And the First Department reached the same conclusion in a different case, People v. Ciochenda, C—I—O—C—H—E—N—D—A. That is 17 A.D. 3d 248. Again, pointing out that the trial Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing inquiry into instances where the defendant violated Court Orders. So, these findings, your Honor, are directly relevant to the defendant's credibility, should he choose to testify. As the Court already noted, the balancing analysis that the Court performs is to take into account not only the potential prejudice to the defendant, but also the prejudice to the People of being unable to present important ——in some cases, dispositive evidence of the defendant's credibility to the jury."

I think for a jury to hear that this Court, the same Judge that is presiding over this case has found Mr. Trump to be in contempt on this case, I think would be so prejudicial, it would be very, very difficult for a jury to look past that. So, I agree with Mr. Blanche, and I am going to deny the People's application to go into that. Anything else?"

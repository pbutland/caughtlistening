    "text": "They will be able to read it later, I would assume. Your Honor, based on defense counsel's proposed jury charges, we understand that they will likely be asking Mr. Cohen today about Judge Furman's decision —— recent decision in the Southern District of New York. We understand that he may be able to inquire about it, but we would object to the decision going in as being extrinsic and collateral. Also, we do think that if they go into that, meaning Judge Furman's decision, not what he testified to, that we would be, on redirect, seeking to admit Judge Engoron's decision about that testimony. So I just wanted to preview that. A couple of other things, just before the testimony continues, I don't know if we can do this on the fly as we go, so I wanted to preview it for the Court. Defense counsel provided us with a number of exhibits. As you know, there are —— well, you may not know, there were some clips on Tuesday, but now there are —— I may be wrong —— but maybe close to 50 clips relating to Mr. Cohen's either TikTok or other programs, podcast programs. We have only the full clips —— I asked for the full clips for some of the exhibits that Mr. Blanche told me he was going to seek to admit; we don't have the full clips for the others, but I didn't know that he was seeking to admit them. He may be seeking to use them. Of course, the witness may not really be able to determine what else was said on that podcast, but we do have some very specific objections for some of the clips that Mr. Blanche may seek to admit. One is, there has been significant testimony about Mr. Cohen's bias."

    "text": "Mr. Cohen's bias, you know, his hostility towards the defendant; his making money off the defendant. And we did not even object to the exhibit relating to some of his merchandise —— we felt that it was going to come in, in any event —— but in that merchandise there are pictures of the defendant behind bars, in an orange jumpsuit. Enough of that has come in at this point. A number of these clips, we think, are precluded by your Honor's decision on the motion, on the People's motion in limine, which is, they reference opinions about whether he should be in jail, whether he should be in handcuffs, whether he should have a mug shot taken. First, our Office did not take mug shots, did not take fingerprints. Mr. Cohen probably is not I aware of that —— it's not something that he may or may not be aware of. But, at this point, we really think that this is intended to elicit something quite improper for the jury. And so, B35 —— just to go over a few of them —— B35 —— the other thing is that they are taken out of context. So, for example, B35, had Mr. Cohen talking about, you know, something like mental excitement about seeing him in an orange jumpsuit, which is what they have excerpted. But what they haven't included is just before that clip and just after that clip his saying \"that's not appropriate, that's not what we should be wanting, what we want is accountability, we should be seeking only accountability, we should be seeking due process, a fair jury, a fair Judge.\" So the context has been excerpted out of that. We are left with an excerpt of a clip talking about excitement about seeing him in a jumpsuit, which, again, we think your Honor has precluded evidence of potential punishment or consequences in this proceeding. So if that is admitted —— we object to it, but if it's admitted, we are going to seek on redirect to submit the clip and its context. And there are other clips, the other clips are similar in many ways, perp walk, handcuffs, et cetera."

And, of course, the Court can limit it appropriately. And we are being judicious, in our view, and we are not offering 50 clips of him saying things.

If they are seeking to admit texts of that nature, well, first of all, we object. We don't think that this should come in. Your Honor had a concern about too much evidence coming in about threats to witnesses, especially because we have a jury who may be concerned. But we are going to object to the exhibit.

And the reasons —— because in our papers, for whatever reason, I believe we had the Eighth Circuit, and it created a whole bunch of what they call, I think, phantom results, because A.I. wants to please the user. And I then provided to my counsel these three cases that were directly on point for why supervised release for me under the circumstances was just improper. And I provided it to him and he included it in the document. And those citations were inaccurate. Not the sum and substance, but the citations themselves."

They used it once without being sustained and once with being sustained; some kind of improper leak. Two, that Michael Cohen or Jeremy Rosenberg or both engaged in this conduct. There is no other reason to ask those questions. And, respectfully, this is not something that should be cleaned up by the person who asks the questions or on redirect. This should be cured by the Court. The Court has given numerous limiting instructions in realtime at the defendant's request. You made this application at the morning break. It still hasn't been cleaned up. To be honest with you, I don’t think cleaning it up by the parties is the right way to go. I think your Honor ought to clarify the record and eliminate any suggestion there was some kind of impropriety. I think those questions were entirely improper. I think it should be up to the Court to cure it, not Mr. Blanche."

And the one that we wanted to discuss —— the category that we wanted to discuss is general definitions and terms that relate directly to this case, such as campaign contributions. And I think, just to frame the conversation, what has changed since the time of the ruling is that both parties had put in requested jury instructions and both parties are seeking instructions regarding FECA and some of the definitions at issue. So one of the reasons that we wanted to bring this up before bringing the expert in is to give your Honor a sense of what we would be seeking to do and to make sure that we are not encroaching on your Honor's potential legal instructions. You have at once both parties who are asking the Court, I think, for instructions on a similar area.

And then the third issue is \"The Press Exemptions\" where we've requested an instruction. I don't think that there is a competing request, and we would be seeking to elicit testimony regarding that exemption from Mr. Smith. So, for basic statutory definitions, I think your Honor has seen those in the parties' proposals, \"contribution,\" \"relative individual contribution limits,\" the term \"expenditure,\" and the term \"coordinated expenditure\" are, I think, what would be the focus. And within a couple of those definitions the statute lays out that phrase \"For The Purpose of Influencing an Election.\" And so that's why we think —— we would seek to elicit from Mr. Smith an interpretation of what that phrase means. And, really, what we would be seeking to do through him, Judge, is sort of track what is in the request that we've submitted to your Honor. So by tracking that phrase is giving content by the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, that the test is an objective one —— excuse me, an objective one under the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Orloski. We would seek to have Mr. Smith describe the facts of Orloski a little bit so that the jury can understand what it means to have an objective test for the concept of \"For The Purpose of Influencing an Election.\" And then describe the —— then you are relating to the Congressman Jim Moran 5141 that's cited in our papers, again, describing some facts, to give the jury a sense of a situation where the FEC has applied that term and how they have done it.

So that's \"For The Purpose of Influencing The Election.\" Next, I mentioned \"The Irrespective Rule,\" which is set out in the FEC's regulations and cited, I think, by both parties in their request to charge. It's at 11 CFR 113 —— I'm sorry. .1(g). And so, we seek to have Mr. Smith discuss that rule, and discuss the focus on whether an expense would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign, which we think is an important issue for the jury to consider with respect to whether the payments at issue could be considered expenditures and/or contributions. And then talk about a little bit how that regulation was developed beginning in 1995. We've cited for your Honor our request for the Federal Register Provisions that discuss the FEC's thinking about that. And, again, through Mr. Smith, what we're doing is trying to give the jury a sense of what the requirements are for this term and how the FEC has applied them. And so, we would walk through a couple more of the MURs that are cited in our request, 7025, 4944. And there is an advisory opinion we cite from 203. Not hypotheticals, but just seeking, again, to give the jury a sense of applications and how the agency then administers the regulation that it created and applies it in practice. And then the last issue that I mentioned that we would be seeking to cover with Mr. Smith is the \"Press Exemptions.\" And that sort of has a basis in both the statute as well as the FEC's regulations. And we have also cited an advisory opinion in our request to charge that, alternatively, we would have Mr. Smith describe, again, just to give the jury a little bit of content around these terms. And I say that, and make this whole proffer with a little bit of concern that we don't want to be treading on your Honor's legal instructions. These are things that, coming into the trial, based on the in limine ruling, we had hoped to do through Mr. Smith. Now, you have these two competing jury instructions and so there is a little bit of tension here, and so we wanted to ——"

We are now making this proffer to your Honor so that everybody sort of has eyes wide open coming into Monday, when I think it's very possible this testimony could come in, that there is a little bit of tension right now between the pending request and what we would cover from —— through Mr. Smith. We are sensitive to that, and we don't want to have him up on the stand and give the impression that we are encroaching on your Honor's province."

    "text": "Your Honor, I think 95 percent of the proffered testimony that was just described flies directly in the face of your extremely clear March 18th Order, which expressly said that Mr. Smith may not testify regarding the interpretation and application of Federal Campaign Finance Laws. You specifically held that he could identify general definitions, but not interpretation or application. So as to each of the three terms of art in the Federal Campaign Finance Law that Mr. Bove just described, \"For The Purpose of Influencing,\" \"Irrespective of the Candidacy,\" and \"Press Exemption,\" 1 think he just walked your Honor through a very long list of Federal Case Law, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit Case Law, as well as Agency Advisory Opinions and Agency Adjudications interpreting those terms. That is —— that kind of testimony from an expert is precisely the reason that there is a general and broadly followed prohibition on testimony by an expert witness on legal matters. And, your Honor, I think there are two compounding problems here. One is that, as Mr. Bove noted, we have also retained an expert witness who, if necessary, would be prepared to testify as to the same issues. But then —— and we anticipate that he would say, based on what we've seen in the defendant's briefing, that the way the defense is interpreting the application of those statutes is inconsistent with how the Agency and how Federal Courts have done the same. But then we've got three people telling the jury what the law is, when there should be only one. It should be your Honor exclusively instructing the jury on how the law applies. I mean, by analogy this would be like calling an expert witness to opine on whether the intent to defraud in the Penal Law definition does or does not —— is or is not limited to a pecuniary financial motive only. That's a brief —— we have briefed it. It's identified in the charge. Your Honor has ruled on it. And that should be the end of it. The —— in fact, the very fact that this is a contested legal issue in the parties proposed instructions to the jury is even more reason why this should be resolved through argument before your Honor at pre—charge conference, not something that we should be putting in expert testimony —— expert testimony to discuss. I think there are two other problems. First, and unless I'm missing it somewhere, the possibility of any testimony on the \"Press Exemption\" has never been included in any of the defense's disclosures regarding this witness, either before or after your Honor's motion in limine. So there is a serious notice problem with the \"Press Exemption\" proposal from the outset. And then there is a broader notice problem, your Honor, which is that it's, as you know, dating back to last November, we tried for months to compel the defendant to disclose reciprocal discovery, including this expert testimony. We had to move the Court to compel reciprocal discovery in November. Your Honor granted that motion. We didn't get the defense expert disclosure until January, and then the entire point of pretrial notice of proffered expert testimony is so the parties can prepare. We filed a motion in limine to exclude their expert testimony. Your Honor largely granted it. And we have prepared a potential rebuttal witness based on the language in your Honor's —— the Court's March 18th Order. So to expand Mr. Smith's testimony at this point, just a few days before he may take the stand, presents a significant notice problem as well because our witness, in reliance on the Court's Order, we have not prepared him to talk about the facts about a D.C. Circuit case or the Orloski case or the Buckley versus the Valeo Supreme Court decision or how it applies. So, your Honor, what Mr. Bove just described is totally outside and way beyond both what your Honor already ruled and any recognized exception to the general prohibition on legal testimony from an expert."

And, as you noted, there is still —— it's still not clear that the Court will. Judge, as a matter of just basic fairness, given the way that the People have now structured their theory of the case, the jury has to be provided instructions one way or another —— or I will say information, one way or another, about how to apply these principles. And so, what I have proffered is from our standpoint what I think are the very basics and the bare minimum that would be required for the jury to make an analysis of whether or not any of these things were unlawful contributions, which is a necessary showing here, at least that there was a conspiracy with that intent. I think we've been clear in pretrial motion practice and from the start that we don't think this jury here should be evaluating a FECA violation. We understand that before your Honor we've lost that fight. What we're saying now is that just basic fairness requires that they understand what the principles are in a fair way. And I think on the \"Press Exemption\" question in particular, I don't think there could be any reasonable dispute that that was absolutely central to both AMI's defense and the FEC's analysis of whether or not there was a campaign contribution both in the Non—Prosecution Agreement and in the Conciliation Agreement. And so ——"

My recollection is that Ms. Necheles said to your Honor at a bench conference last week, before any of the proposed jury instructions were in, that they intended to raise with your Honor, to question what their expert would be permitted to testify to. So I'm not sure that we can credit the characterization that this proffer and these instructions are necessitated by differences of opinion regarding the law in the proposed jury instructions. And then, second, on the press exemption, as you know, your Honor, we haven't yet responded to the submission that the defense put in the other day. I'm not sure, as I stand here right now, that we will oppose the exclusion of the language in the charge to define the \"Press Exemption,\" but the \"Press Exemption\" is why this entire undertaking is way beyond what any witness should testify to. The statutes and the regulations combined contain about 20 words of texts on the \"Press Exemption.\" That entire concept is developed almost entirely through additional case law in courts and through agency application. So, it's exactly the kind of thing that has been developed through the adjudicative and agency determination process and that the parties can discuss with you and that you should decide, your Honor, not an expert, certainly not competing experts instructing the jury."

    "text": "I don't think that the fact that each of you has submitted proposed jury charges necessarily changes my ruling or my decision to the motions in limine. To direct your attention specifically to the area that dealt with this, I direct your attention to Pages 1, 2 and 3 of the Court's decision. And I will read from the very last, next to last paragraph of the Court's decision: \"The People's motion is granted to the extent that Smith may not testify as a lay fact witness, offer opinion testimony regarding the interpretation and application of Federal Campaign Finance Laws and how they relate to the facts in the instant matter, nor may Smith testify or offer an opinion as to whether the alleged conduct in this case does or does not constitute a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). However, Smith will be permitted to testify generally as to the following: General background as to what the Federal Election Campaign Commission is; background as to who makes up the FEC; what the FEC's function is; what laws, if any, the FEC is responsible for enforcing; and general definitions and terms that relate directly to this case; such as, for example, campaign contribution. As I listen to your presentation, Mr. Bove, it sounds to me like what you are asking is that I enlarge this decision quite a bit. When I hear you use words like \"interpretation,\" \"past decisions,\" \"advisory opinions,\" that does sound an awful lot like what would normally be called opinions on the law. And, in fact, you used the term, \"a battle of the experts.\" The only reason we would get into \"a battle of the experts\" is if your expert got on the stand and testified as to some sort of expert opinion not only about FECA, but possibly the law and then the People would put on their expert to rebut that; and then I would have to instruct the jury. We are definitely not going to go there. What I'm going to do, in fairness to you, because I would like to digest both submissions further, I will take some time this weekend to do that, to read and study both sets of submissions. I would also like to read the minutes from what has just happened here. But until you hear differently from me, my ruling has not changed. It's going to be limited to the very, very general definitions and very general background information. I also do agree with the People that they had asked for a very long period of time for disclosure and notice regarding the expert witness, and despite the repeated efforts to get that, it didn't come until, finally, very late in the game. It was offered, but in a manner to suggest that the witness would actually testify as a fact witness, and you know what my ruling was on that, an expert can't testify as a fact witness because they don't know the facts of the case. So, at that point, the purpose of your expert was greatly diminished. Again, in fairness to you, I will consider your arguments. I will go back and reread the submissions, but until and unless you hear differently from me, my ruling has not changed. If there is any question as to what the ruling is, again, go back to Pages 1, 2 and 3."

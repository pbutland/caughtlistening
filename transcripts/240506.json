    "text": "Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Trump. So, the matter called into the record is the People's motion for contempt. Before I hand down my decision, I did want to address the Defense and Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, as you know, the Prosecution has filed three separate motions asking this Court to find you in contempt. In a moment, I am going to hand down my decision on the third motion, in which I find you in criminal contempt for the tenth time. It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent; therefore, going forward, this Court will have to consider a jail sanction if recommended. Mr. Trump, it's important to understand that the last thing I want to do is to put you in jail. You are the former President of the United States and possibly the next President, as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings, which I imagine you want to end as quickly as possible. I also worry about the people who would have to execute that sanction: the court officers, the correction officers, the Secret Service detail, among others. I worry about them and about what would go into executing such a sanction. Of course, I'm also aware of the broader implications of such a sanction. The magnitude of such a decision is not one—sided. But, at the end of the day, I have a job to do, and part of that job is to protect the dignity of the judicial system and compel respect. Your continued violations of this Court's lawful Order threaten to interfere with the administration of justice in constant attacks which constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue. So, as much as I do not want to impose a jail sanction, and I have done everything I can to avoid doing so, I want you to understand that I will, if necessary and appropriate. Do the attorneys have any other questions about that? I will now hand down the decision from the Court. This is for the Defense, and this is for the People."

Just to flag, we identified The Trump Organization exhibits for the Defense and asked them to identify for us any evidentiary objections they had about two weeks ago. On May lst, they sent us an email identifying a number of exhibits —— a number of objections to certain exhibits. I'll identify them for you now. But, I anticipate we'll only be getting to about eight or so exhibits today, many of —— where there are objections the parties need to discuss. Most of those objections, I understand, are about hearsay questions that I think would not be disruptive to handle at sidebar when it is introduced. There's at least one exhibit that was the subject of a Defense motion in limine to exclude. That's the exhibit consisting of Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes on the Essential Consultants' bank statement. As your Honor held in the Defendant's motion in limine, the People are prepared to lay an appropriate business records foundation for that record today. Again, I think to the extent the Defense has any objection after that foundation is laid, we can also handle that at sidebar."

And then I —— when I add the second 180,000, I come up with a total of 410,000. Then he said, \"Use 420,\" because I was possibly rattling the numbers back to Allen and he said: \"No, no, the number is 420.\" Instead of figuring out what I did write, I wrote \"420.\" So I used 420 and I divided it by 12 —— by 12 so that's 35,000 per month effective 2/1/17, which was 2017.

Meaning, the statements by Mr. Cohen in this case are being offered as a business record exception to the hearsay rule. That's our objection. The more meaningful objection —— it's not the same as the one we raised this morning, from our understanding, the People are going to offer People's Exhibit 42 through this witness, who we believe is a Trump Organization employee. And it appears to us, unless we're wrong to be Capital One Bank Records, and we very much object to that. I can walk through the information on this exhibit —— that is, in theory, going to be offered for the truth. There is no way this witness can offer a business record foundation for this."

If you move on to other checks, there is information on these checks that I don't think this witness can explain. For example, on the second page, it says something totally different on the stamped check. It says something about Richmond, Virginia. It has a signatory that isn't Mr. Cohen. And the point is, the reason why you are supposed to lay a foundation and have the witness testify about the records and what they mean, as we heard this morning from Mr. McConney, there needs to be enough foundation laid to explain and justify the information on the check that is hearsay to allow it into evidence for the truth.

    "text": "Among other things, some additional Tweets and Truths from the defendant, as well as to —— as a summary witness to go through some of the texts that were admitted as part of People's 171A. As you know, there was a lot of back and forth about that exhibit, about certain items that were redacted. We tabled it and agreed to have a summary witness read it later. I would like to address counsel's arguments from the bench, but also to address some additional arguments that counsel has made —— and I don't think through any bad faith —— but it's just not true. And counsel has said this several times, that counsel has not had notice of the exhibits that we are going to use. First of all, we have been designating exhibits for the last eight months periodically on a rolling basis, and with very few exceptions, had designated all of our exhibits by March 15th. The Court had a request from the People to extend, and you extended that deadline over the defendant's objection to March 25th, and we served a few additional exhibits. But it's not like this is the first time that these exhibits have been brought to counsels' attention. Second of all, before the trial started, we provided redacted versions of all of the exhibits we intended to introduce at trial, as well as an exhibit list. On April 11th, we had a lengthy conversation with counsel in which we listed precisely which Trump Organization—produced exhibits we would be seeking to introduce. And we did that because we were discussing the potential —— a potential stipulation that didn't end up happening. But, these exhibits have been designated for a very long time, so I don't think counsel is intentionally misleading the Court to say that, you know, they just found out yesterday that these exhibits were going to be admitted. What we have been doing is notifying counsel the day before who the witness —— who the next day's witnesses are going to be. The reason for this, as we've made clear, is because the defendant has been violating the Order, restricting extrajudicial speech. And we did not want to have the witnesses' names, the next witnesses' names out there. The defense has our witness list; has had it for months. That list includes Ms. Longstreet, who testified on Friday, and all of the witnesses who will be testifying at the trial. I'm saying this because I don't like the impression being left that we are somehow sandbagging the defense by telling them the day before who our witnesses are or what our exhibits are. They may not be finding out the order of which we're going to be calling these witnesses or introducing these exhibits. But, they have had the entire witness list and the exhibit list for a very long time. Getting back to your Honor's question about Ms. Longstreet. We called her on Friday. As you remember, and let me just first say that, of course, the Court has inherent authority to control the order and the mechanics of witness examination during the trial. As you know, we learned Thursday that a juror had a medical appointment or issue that required early departure on Friday. There were certain aspects of Ms. Longstreet's testimony that needed to come in before Hope Hicks could testify. And so, we called her and truncated her direct examination so that we could get her off the stand and get Ms. Hicks on the stand so that we could, hopefully, finish her and not have to get her back today, because the juror had to leave. And as you recall, we timed that pretty closely. I think we ended on Friday at 3:30, and the juror had to leave sometime between 3:30 and 3:45. So, shortly after, we discussed Ms. Longstreet. We notified —— we put on the record at a bench conference that we intended to recall her. I don’t think that there is any remote prejudice that the defense will suffer from allowing us to recall her for these limited purposes, which, as I said, include some additional Tweets that were not relevant to Ms. Hicks' testimony, but are relevant to a subsequent witness’ testimony. And then to have —— really, the bulk of her testimony will involve going through the exhibit that had been the subject of a lot of back and forth about which portions were appropriate to redact. And I believe at the time that we finalized that, we indicated that we would use a summary witness to read those texts."

I’m happy to be told I’m wrong, but that’s what I am referencing when I said that to the Court that I didn't have her name. Secondly, I did not say to the Court at sidebar that we did not the know the exhibits. I said we did not know which exhibits the People were going to offer with respect to this witness. She’s not on it. And so, the point was that when they told us included on the witness list was a custodian from the X Corp, and a custodian from Truth Social —— so, when we learned that she was going to be testifying and getting those exhibits in, as your Honor knows, we objected, and we prepared a cross based upon our understanding of what she was going to be allowed to admit. We didn’t know, like I said, her name until Wednesday afternoon. We then performed the cross, assuming those were the exhibits she was going to offer. As the Court is aware, part of the cross was that, I think the point was that of the however many thousands of social media posts she was tasked with reviewing, the witness testified to only seven or nine, whatever the numbers were that she was asked to identify and admitted in evidence. I did not know at the time, because no one told us what was just said today, was that there was timing and scheduling issues and so they only intended to call this witness to get a few exhibits in and then they intended to recall her. That's not the way it’s supposed to work. And I agree with the People that it’s absolutely within your discretion under the rules, under Rule 107. But, if you look at the cases, to the extent that there are cases on this issue, the reasons given for recalling a witness, at least that I have found, do not include a summary witness who they call just to get some stuff in, not tell anybody they're going to recall them, and then after the witness leaves, the stand and say: Oh, we're going to recall her."

J—2 and J—17, they are specifically tweets that you —— she elicited that Ms. Daniels wrote and put on her Twitter. But Ms. Necheles did not elicit the tweets to which she was responding, which are both threatening. For example, J—2, she specifically asked about it. It was responsive to a threat that she received on that. In fact, the witness answered that, but Ms. Necheles did not put it in evidence. And so, frankly, we feel that the jury needs to have the full context on those. I would like to admit one of them. On the second one, I would like to at least elicit a question about what her tweet was in response to. Certainly, your Honor has ruled that these types of threats can be elicited in a proper context. They have cross—examined throughly on the fact that, one, it attempts to undermine the threat in 2018 in the parking lot. These are in some ways corroborative of that. Second, they have cross—examined extensively about the fact that she was only doing all of this to make money, and even her testimony here, and her story is all about money, undermining the fact that there are other issues that have arisen in terms of the threats, and that her whole reason to testify here is not purely about money and that there have been other costs. In fact, Ms. Necheles asked about that, and specifically about the money she made, all the money that she had made off of this."

And it is significant because, for example, on the news last night, there was —— and this is just one example, and there are many —— one of the supposed participants in that evening, the friend of Ms. Daniels who supposedly was returned —— she got a phone call from the room that there was testimony about."

It's now him having to not be able to respond to this new version of events that now deals very deeply with a very different issue than a sexual event that took place in 2006. And so, you know, as we said repeatedly —— and I'm not going to dwell on it —— but, you know, this is about —— he needs an opportunity to respond to the American people. And the reasons for the Gag Order as they relate to Ms. Daniels are over. She's no longer a witness. And as it relates to other witnesses in the case, your Honor, we are towards the end of the case, I can be corrected by the People, but I believe that the only significant witness left —— that's the wrong word —— the only witness that is really the subject of the Gag Order is Mr. Cohen. And so, as far as the Court's concern about this proceeding, it should give way to the testimony of the past couple of days. I mean, he's going to be asked repeatedly over the next week or two about these new accusations of consent and of what happened that night. And as the Gag Order stands now, he's not allowed to say, \"I did not do that.\" So there are voters out there and there are questioners who will ask him questions about it, and he can't say anything. His —— the other side can say things. And they already have. There are numerous news articles about it. Many articles, your Honor, today, just based on yesterday."

        "text": "Thank you, Judge. And it seems as though the other side lives in almost an alternate reality. First of all, there is not another side out there. There is a proceeding here that this Order is designed to protect. And I think it has been somewhat effective thus far. And I think we have to look back as to why it was issued in the first place, to put in context what's going on here. This Order was issued to protect the witnesses, the citizens participating as jurors, all the people participating in this proceeding, and the very proceeding itself. This is where facts are brought out. This is where, if somebody wants to respond to something that's said in this room, that can happen in this room. It's not supposed to happen out there. There are people out there saying things about Ms. Daniels and other witnesses, clearly saying them with the defendant in mind. I'm not in a position to say that it's at his direction or anything close to that. But there are people making the defendant’s case for him out in the world. We have been told repeatedly by witnesses, even in the courtroom, even on the stand, we have seen the fear in some of these witnesses. The witness who just testified, a couple of times broke in because there was an exhibit displayed on the screen that had her home address. And you could see the fear in her eyes when that happened. It was luckily not displayed to the public. And that’s because of what this defendant is doing. It’s what he has done in the past. It’s why this Order was issued. The Order was not issued lightly. It was issued after we developed an extensive record relating to the attacks this defendant mounts indiscriminately for anyone that he deems worthy of his venom. He does it selfishly, with no concern about the safety of the people he is attacking. And, unfortunately, we have seen the results. Among the evidence the People submitted, in a room that formed the basis of the two Orders restricting extrajudicial statements, was evidence of the significant safety consequences of the defendant's public attacks. We submitted an affidavit from the head of the DANY —— the DA's Office Executive Protective Detail about the explosion and threat cases lodged by the NYPD against the DA, his family, members of the Prosecution, their families. Your Honor has seen firsthand, as I talked about the very real consequences for witnesses when they express fear in the courtroom. I had a conversation with a witness last night, a custodial witness, somebody who is coming in to put in records, who is concerned about safety. And that's not the only witness like that. They are not witnesses who have a huge stake in this, and they are worried about it. The fact that witnesses are brave enough to come in here, under subpoena, tell the truth under oath, shouldn't expose them to this defendant's barrage of threats that will put them and potentially their families in danger. Modifying this Gag Order now, in the middle of trial, would signal to future witnesses that they could be at risk as well. In affirming the D.C. Court's Gag Order in the D.C. criminal case, the D.C. Circuit relied on exactly this point. That Court held, and I quote here: \"Common sense and common human experience teach that hostile messages regarding evidentiary cooperation that publicly relate to high profile witnesses have a significant likelihood of deterring, chilling or altering the involvement of other witnesses in the case itself.\" \"The undertow generated by such statements does not stop with the named individual. It is also highly likely to influence other witnesses.\" Here, we have other witnesses. We have a jury. This is a proceeding that's going on. Some of these Orders have involved proceedings where we weren't even on trial yet. Here we are on trial. This Order is not designed just to protect the witness until they are done on the stand and then they walk out the door and they have no protection. And it's not just designed to protect the proceeding part of the way. I also just wanted to point out, we saw a quote from this defendant an hour and a half ago that sort of addressed that exact point. He said: \"You attack people because other people see you doing it, and it sends a message.\" That's his words on that screen today. And that's what he's doing here. Modifying the Gag Order now to allow the defendant to attack Ms. Daniels —— and that's what he wants to do. Let's not pretend he wants to engage in high—minded discourse, and to thereby put her at risk would seriously risk jeopardizing the integrity of these proceedings. We understand —— well, I will leave it there. Thank you."

But, the only reason why her testimony was admissible, according to the Court's ruling prior to trial, was to President Trump's motive and intent, the coconspirator's motive and intent, and what they knew at the time. So their motive and intent was based off of, among the articles and what she was saying publicly at the time, which is that: \"Ugh, here we go. We started kissing. I hope he doesn't try to pay me.\" Okay."

My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels, or a witness who has already testified. My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole. That means that everybody sees what happens. Witnesses who have not yet testified will see what happens. They will see how witnesses who have testified are going to be treated by your client. So, the portion that I wrote down was where your client is attributed with saying \"because other people will see you doing it.\" And that's my concern. Other witnesses, including not only Michael Cohen, but these other witnesses that Mr. Conroy referred to, will see your client doing whatever it is that he intends to do. And I can't take your word for it that, no, no, this is going to be low key, this is not going to be an attack, this is just going to be a response to what was said, because that's just not the track record. The reason why the Gag Order is in place, to begin with, is precisely because of the nature of these attacks. The vitriol, these were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses. So the track record, your client's track record speaks for itself. I can't take your word for it that he will just say, hey, I dispute the facts. Now, I continue to be concerned about the witnesses using the Gag Order as a sword instead of a shield. And I will continue to be mindful of that. And I will continue to keep an eye out for that, but that's not what I see happening here right now. And that's not the argument that I see you making. So, with regard to your application for me to modify the Gag Order to allow your client to respond to Ms. Daniels, that application is denied. I will hear you on the motion for a mistrial."

        "text": "Your Honor, we started this conversation yesterday. I made a motion yesterday, and I am making another motion today. We are also prepared, if it's helpful to the Court, as we go through this, to put something in writing over the weekend that further articulates why we believe that there is simply no way that this case should go forward given the testimony that happened, the past day with Ms. Daniels. It's worth —— we mentioned it yesterday, but it's worth mentioning it, that in your Honor's decision of March 18th on Page 4, when you are explaining why Ms. Daniels testimony is admissible at this trial, you, the Court says: \"Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated the falsification of business records, but is also probative of the defendant's intent.\" \"Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the narrative of events and is necessary background for the jury. We then, thereafter, your Honor, put in a motion for an adjournment based upon, in part, on Ms. Clifford's recent change of story. And we alerted the Court and the Government that Ms. Daniels was now making additional claims, contradicting her previous claims that were made at the time that the NDA was entered into, claiming that the —— that this, you know, again, completely made—up encounter with President Trump may have been non—consensual. And we got that from the documentary that was recently released and from a few pages of notes from December when the People met with Ms. Daniels and gave us the notes. And then, as the Court knows, before the testimony started, we objected again. And the Court allowed —— indicated it would allow testimony about it, but said that it was fine, but we don't need to know the details of the intercourse; and Ms. Hoffinger said that's correct. And then, what proceeded to happen was a whole host of questions that went way beyond just mere fact that it happened. And it included questions from the transcript at Page 2592 asking about the fact that Ms. Daniels had a difficult time growing up. And, again, that was objected to, and it was sustained; but that's a question that should have never been asked. And she then is questioned about President Trump spanking —— being asked to be spanked during the incident. Again, how that's relevant to why we're here, when you —— especially when you weigh it and compare it to the prejudicial nature of that sort of testimony. It almost defies belief that we're here about a records case and the Government is asking questions about an incident that happened in 2006, which we deny even happened, and a series of questions about rolling up a magazine and spanking him. The Court then warned the Government at the break and said that the degree of detail that we're going into here is unnecessary, we don't need to know the details, what the suite looked like or anything like that, please move along more quickly. And the Government said, Okay. They did not do that, your Honor. Instead, they —— there was extensive testimony —— and, again, this is extremely prejudicial testimony. This is not a case about —— this is not a case about sex. This isn't a case about whether that incident took place or didn't take place. Presumably, the NDA can be entered and was entered. We completely denied it. Ms. Daniels said it happened, the NDA was entered. Whether it happened or not has nothing to do with the charges in this case. And it continued on. At Page 2609 of the transcript, there was a question asked about what the inside of the bathroom looked like; right. And you will hear, your Honor, when I'm just highlighting some of the questions that were asked, this isn't a witness that was out of control. This was a question that was answered in response to the Government's question of what the bathroom looked like inside; and she answered the question."

        "text": "little bit later on, I already read it to the Court in response to the Gag Order, the question was: \"What was your reaction to seeing him like that?\" Now, before the —— before the witness took the stand, there was direction given by the Court about limiting that. There was additional direction by the Court after the break about moving expeditiously through this. And there is an open—ended question about what your reaction was to seeing him like that. There is a very long answer that, again, is completely different than the story that Mr. Cohen, that AMI knew about, Dylan Howard, Gina Rodriguez, the story that they had been told about in 2016, when they were presumably negotiating and determining what —— whether to pay for this story. That's not the story that they were told. So, it's not relevant, and it shouldn't have been asked. And I already read that. I'm not going to reread it again. And then, it didn't stop there. Page 2610 of the transcript onto Page 2611, there is a long question about what happened when she exited the bathroom. And this is where, again, she said something not anywhere near the story that was told, supposedly, to Mr. Cohen. She says: \"I went to step around. I laughed nervously, tried to make a joke out of it and to step around to leave. Even though I was moving like I was in a funhouse, like slow motion. I thought to myself; great. I put myself in this bad situation. Like, what did I do? How did I misread everything? He stood up between me and the door. Not in a threatening manner. He didn't come at me. He didn't rush at me. He didn't put his hands on me or nothing like that. I said, I got to go. He said, I thought we were getting somewhere. We were talking. I thought you were serious about what you wanted, if you ever want to get out of that trailer park.\" Now, again, that is a power description. That is an extremely prejudicial statement by a witness that was never said to —— there is no evidence that that was said to AMI. There was no evidence that that was said to Mr. Cohen. There was no evidence that that had anything to do with the motive of anybody involved in this case to enter into that NDA in 2016. On the other hand, it's just extraordinarily prejudicial for a jury to hear. Shortly thereafter, 2611 to '12, the question is: \"What happened next, briefly?\" Okay. There has already been testimony —— the Court was clear with the Government to not go into more than just the fact that it happened. But, they didn't abide by the Court's rules. \"What happened next?\" And the witness says, \"I think I blacked out. I wasn't drunk. I just don't remember.\" And then there was the questions that we talked about yesterday, about how —— the size; how tall was he. So, there is a question: \"So, he was standing up and you were standing up. What were your relative heights?\" How is that relevant to this case? That is so prejudicial, and so incredible for a jury to hear the Government ask a witness talking about what she's now saying is a power move by the person who she's having sex with, okay. And the DA says: \"Well, what were your heights,\" knowing the answer. Now, we didn't know the answer because we didn't get any notes from their prep except for one from December. But, they knew the answer because there was no surprise when she said, \"I'm 5'6\"; I don't know how tall he was, but several inches taller and much larger.\" Okay. Now —— and then there was a question about the —— whether a —— at 2613, about whether she felt threatened and the answer was, \"No. Not physically.\" And then she describes how threatened she felt. \"Although I did note there was a bodyguard right outside the door. There was an imbalance of power for sure.\" I mean, that is —— I mean, you have jurors who are now hearing about an imbalance of power between a man and a woman. And none of that information is information that goes to the motive of anybody in this case, including President Trump, because it's not any information that she was saying at the time, which is the only reason that evidence is coming in, your Honor. And, then, even though your Honor had said that, clearly, that that's fine —— this is the transcript at Page 2511, before the witness took the stand: \"We don't need to know the details of the intercourse.\" But the People still asked. And then the People said: \"Can you very briefly describe, you know, where you had sex with him?\" She describes it. In detail. Right. And I'm not going to read all of the whole answer. But it's 2613 and '14. And, again, I don't know what —— I mean, our understanding of the Court's motion in limine for why this evidence was coming in and then your Honor's instructions, there was no basis for the Government to ask that question, given what the testimony was offered for, your Honor. And then the People didn't stop there. They asked whether she remembers how her clothes came off. And the answer was no. And the question —— and, again, presumably the Government knows this is coming —— says, \"Is that a memory that has not come back to you?\" Again, that is so prejudicial to suggest that there was an event where —— again, I mean, nothing to do with this case and why we're here. And the answer, that was an objection sustained, but it's the question that should never have been asked. Thereafter, the Government wouldn't stop. They said: \"Do you have a recollection of feeling something unusual that you have a memory of?\" There is no reason for that question, your Honor. That should not have been asked. And, you know, we didn't know these questions were coming. We didn't know. And that's —— you know, we had a sense from her documentary that she was changing her story. And we alerted the Court, and we alerted the Government, but we were sitting here, hearing that for the first time on the witness stand yesterday. And then, finally, at 2615: \"What, if anything, did you remember other than the fact that you had sex on the bed?\" The answer: \"I was staring at the ceiling. I didn't know how I got there. I made note like I was trying to think about anything other than what was happening there.\""

And then the questions about wearing a condom. Judge, now, in that situation, the significance of that is —— and, again, we didn't know this was coming. But, a few minutes earlier, the questions had been elicited about her job and about how and why she went to work for a particular company, the only company in the industry where a condom is mandatory, and so then eliciting that there wasn't a condom —— and, again, that has nothing to do with the false business records, but is so prejudicial. It's a dog whistle for rape."

        "text": "Okay. So that was a lot that Mr. Blanche said. Most of it just flat out untrue. Starting with the fact that this is a new account. This is not a new account. This account has been documented in many previous interviews, which the defense has had access to, and used somewhat effectively and somewhat misleadingly on cross—examination. Not the least of which is, at least half the things that Mr. Blanche has said that they didn't know was coming are included in the exhaustive typed interview notes that were taken in a December interview with Ms. Daniels, and shared with counsel promptly after that interview. Those details were elicited in the Anderson Cooper interview. They were elicited in numerous other interviews, all of which the defense has access to. So the claim of ambush is just nonsense. The claim of changing the story is also extraordinarily untrue. There may be, as with any witness recounting a story, details that are said in one forum, but not in the another forum. Things that were, you know, omitted in an interview that was given for entertainment purposes versus an interview that was given for, you know, a more fulsome interview with Anderson Cooper in 2018 versus an interview in preparation for trial testimony, which is more detailed than any of those things, versus a documentary. All of which the defense has had access to. So, our first point here is that this is not a change of story, as they have tried to characterize it. Second of all, to the extent that there were inconsistencies, Ms. Necheles —— certainly, Ms. Necheles certainly probed them in her very narrow, but somewhat misleading cross—examination. You will remember that she, in an attempt —— she attempted to impeach Ms. Daniels with three or four inconsistencies or omissions from the Anderson Cooper interview, which were allowed. We attempted to put in the rest of that interview to show just how similar her testimony was to the account that she gave Anderson Cooper in 2018. And I’m not going to reargue the ruling, I understand the Court's ruling on that. But, the fact of the matter is, is Ms. Necheles led a very misleading impression, as Mr. Blanche is doing now, that her story has somehow become radically different from the way that it always was. So, moving on to the actual mistrial motion. It has always been the People's contention that the details in this case, the details of the two—hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with the defendant in the living room and the dining room of his hotel room in Harrah's corroborate her account. They corroborate, A, the fact that sex happened, which increases the motivation to silence her. I will point out a few things. Well, the point here is that the details of her story, both before and during the sexual act corroborate her story. That is the —— those are the kind of details that make her account more credible. Now, the defense has gone through great lengths to try to discredit her, to try to claim that the sex never happened. And, incidentally, if they want to offer testimony of the fact that the sex never happened, that's their prerogative. However, they have —— they opened on, and this is Page 96 of the transcript, referring to Stormy Daniels: \"She was paid so she would not spread false claims about Mr. Trump.\" They opened also on Page 905 to 906 of the transcript: \"Ms. Clifford has publicly denied any improper relationship in writing.\" Page 906 of the opening: \"Her testimony will be salacious.\" Now, this is all coming from the defense. And so, they are basically trying to have their cake and eat it too. They are trying to discredit Ms. Daniels by claiming in their opening that her story is false and then preclude the People from eliciting the very details that can corroborate that account because they have the ring of truth. Ms. —— Mr. Blanche gives a couple of examples and thinks that these questions were totally out of left field. For example, he raises the question about the spanking incident that Ms. Daniels relayed during her testimony. And Ms. Daniels also testified that when she came out of the bathroom in Mr. Trump's —— the bathroom off of Mr. Trump's bedroom, that he was lying on the bed and the first thing that went through her head was: \"How did I misread this?\" \"How did I misunderstand these clues?\" \"How did I think this was about a business meeting?\" And you can bet that if we didn't draw the sting and elicit the spanking incident, that Ms. Necheles would have cross—examined her: Oh, really? You spanked him? You didn't think that there was anything sexual about that. So we needed to give her a chance to explain that, to prevent them from undermining her credibility. Similarly, Mr. Blanche complains about eliciting the fact that Mr. Trump did not wear a condom during their sexual encounter. Now, if you remember the testimony, and part of the reason the testimony was elicited about the conversation that preceded the sexual encounter, is that Mr. Trump seemed —— asked a lot of questions about the testing in the adult film industry: How often the testing happens, whether performers are required to wear condoms, et cetera, questions about that. And the reason —— the reason that that's relevant is because it explains his decision to not wear a condom. And the fact that testimony about him not wearing a condom comes out is because the description of the conversation that she had with Mr. Trump, again, corroborates her story. So what seems like a detail that is insignificant and irrelevant to Mr. Blanche is not, as Ms. Necheles' cross made perfectly clear; cherry—picking the details that she thought were inconsistent and omitting the details that have always been consistent. So the overarching point here is that the details are essential to give the jury the tools they need to analyze her credibility. And presenting only a generalized account undermines her reliability as a witness because it affects her ability to perceive and remember these details. And Mr. Blanche complains about the fact that these details are messy. But, the point is —— and Mr. Blanche says, well, she never said any of this to Michael Cohen or AMI in 2016. She didn't speak to Mr. Cohen or AMI in 2016. But you know who knew what happened in that room? Mr. Trump knew. And those details of what happened in that room, those messy details, that is motive. That was Mr. Trump's motive to silence this woman before she could tell her story in 2016, less than a month before the election. So, these are not —— this is not irrelevant. Mr. Trump was aware of those details. And the fact that the testimony is prejudicial and messy, according to Mr. Blanche, that is why Mr. Trump tried so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about this. Notwithstanding all of that, we went out of our way to eliminate the most salacious details in order to avoid embarrassing the defendant, even though some of those details are highly corroborative. And, you know, there was a fair amount of detail elicited about the room outside, the conversation, the two—hour conversation that Ms. Daniels had with Mr. Trump. But do you know where there was not a lot of detail elicited? The actual sexual encounter. By my count, there are about eight questions about it. Most of them are yes or no answers. There is no opportunity for long explanations about it. We tried very hard to respond to your Honor's efforts to pull back the testimony and to not have a fulsome description of the actual sexual act. And, you know, despite the fact that the details of that sexual act would corroborate her story, they were not elicited. I will give you an example. I believe your Honor sustained the objection here, at one point Ms. Daniels was asked, you know: \"Did you feel anything unusual?\" Now, the answer to that question was going to be: \"I felt what it felt like to feel the skin of a 60—year old man. I was 27 years old. And that was a different —— that was different than anything I had ever felt before.\" Now, that's the kind of detail that would corroborate her account of having a sexual interaction with the defendant, but was not elicited. Your Honor sustained the objection. There are other details that I don't want to put on the record. I'm happy to make an ex parte —— or not an ex parte, a sealed record about some of the very salacious details that were deliberately omitted, notwithstanding the fact that they are highly corroborative because we did not have the desire to embarrass the defendant. So Mr. Blanche, in his application, is conflating the significant level of detail that was elicited about the pre—encounter, the conversation, the relatively harmless conversation that happened in the dining room and living room, but not details about the sexual encounter. And that's what —— the adjustment that we made to be responsive to your Honor's concerns that we not go too far into the details of the sexual encounter. I'm going to say one more thing about this, which is the argument —— this argument was thoroughly briefed by the defense in their endeavor to keep this testimony out, as well as similar testimony about Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin. And, by the way, about Karen MacDougal, we didn't change our minds about calling her. She was on our witness list, but we had never indicated an actual intention to call her. I am just correcting Mr. Blanche. We had never affirmatively indicated that we were going to call her. She was like many people on our witness list. Anyway, back to what I was saying. This issue was thoroughly briefed. And the Court, mindful of the potential prejudice, limited the details of the Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin story to just the fact of the allegation and not the underlying details, but did not make a similar limitation on the Stormy Daniels story because, as the Court recognized, it was so intertwined with the motive to silence her. I'm just going to read very briefly from your Honor's ruling."

Their testimony qualifies under several of the Molineux exceptions.\" I'm skipping a little bit. \"Locating and purchasing the information from Daniels not only completes the narrative of events that precipitated the falsification of business records, but is also probative of the defendant's intent.\" \"Further, the evidence and testimony surrounding these individuals is inextricably intertwined with the narrative of events and is necessary background for the jury.\" Your Honor went on to distinguish between Karen McDougal and Dino Sajudin: \"However, when carefully balancing the probative value of testimony against the potential for undue prejudice, the Court believes that the testimony from or about Sajudin and McDougal must come with some limitations. Unless the People provide a satisfactory offering of proof, the testimony by or about Sajudin and McDougal will be limited to the fact of, and may not explore the underlying details of, what allegedly transpired between those individuals and the defendant.\" And we honored that ruling. That limitation did not apply to Stormy Daniels, although the defense asked that it did. I'm only saying this to say that we feel that we have very faithfully adhered to your Honor's rulings and even took additional details out of the questions that we had planned on asking Ms. Daniels as a result of your Honor's —— the conversation that we had at the bench before she began testifying, when the defense renewed their motion. All of this to say, is that the defense has not alleged anything remotely approaching grounds for a mistrial. And their motion should be denied."

        "text": "No, it doesn't. I am making the ruling, and I decide whether it does or it doesn't. I'm telling you, it doesn't. Please have a seat so that I can render my decision. Following your motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, I went back to chambers and I pulled out my decisions on both motions in limine; the omnibus decision. I also looked at the transcript from Tuesday's proceedings. I looked at that yesterday. And I went back to just make sure that everyone had followed my guidelines and that there were no inconsistencies, and to just make sure that no one had violated my rulings. After having done so, after reading, again, both sets of motions, both decisions and the motions in limine, the Omnibus Motion and the transcripts, I came away satisfied that —— let me backup. You will recall in my decisions, both in the motions in limine and the omnibus motions, that while I did decide on many of the issues, there were some that I said we are going to have to see how the evidence comes in. And at every trial, the evidence comes in in a different way and it's very, very difficult to anticipate. So sometimes a Court has to change its rulings. Sometimes there has to be a certain amount of flexibility. Why do I say that now? Because in going back to the very opening statements, and I'm looking at Pages 897, 905, 906. Mr. Blanche, in your opening statement, you deny that there was ever a sexual encounter between Stormy Daniels and the defendant. And, again, I direct you to Page 897. Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe: Donald Trump, who denies there was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there was. Although the People do not have to prove that a sexual encounter actually did occur, they do have the right to rehabilitate Ms. Daniels' credibility and to corroborate her story, which was immediately attacked on opening statements. The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh to determine whether the encounter did occur and, if so, whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels' story. Now, there is more to say about the details. You will recall that I commented on the details on Tuesday. And I will get to that in a minute. 1 direct your attention to pages 2508 and 2511 of the transcript, having to do with Ms. Daniels' story, but we continue. Ms. Necheles claimed when you made your motion for a mistrial that she did not object more or earlier or more frequently because she believed that my ruling at the bench had prevented her from doing so. That's not correct. In fact, if you look at the transcript, you will see that Ms. Necheles actually objected very early on. Look at Page 2592. So she can't say that she didn't object because of my ruling when, in fact, she did object at 2592. However, there were many times, not once or twice, but many times when Ms. Necheles could have objected, but didn't. And, here, I will direct your attention to Pages 2598 and 2610. Now, after the Court sua sponte objects, and that objection had to do with the reference to the trailer park, I felt that wasn't necessary. I felt that there was a certain amount of prejudice to that. There was no objection, so I sua sponte objected. I didn't want that in. And then I struck it from the record. Following the Court's own objection, Ms. Necheles then began to object with some frequency. And virtually every single one of her objections was sustained. And every one of her applications that the answers be stricken from the record were, in fact, stricken from the record. And I direct your attention now to Pages 2612 through 2615 for that. Yet, for some unexplained reason, which I still don't understand, there was no objection to certain testimony, which was later used in the motion for a mistrial on Tuesday, and again used today. For example, the mention of the condom. I agree that shouldn't have come out. I wished those questions hadn't been asked, and I wished those answers hadn't been given. But for the life of me, I don't know why Ms. Necheles didn't object. She had just made about ten objections, most of which were sustained. Why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of a condom? I don't understand. We continue. Ms. Daniels made clear in her testimony, and I direct you now to Page 2611, that she was not drunk or drugged or in any way coerced. Again, this is Page 2611. And for some reason, I don't know why, you went into it ad nauseam on cross—examination. I had sustained any objections related to that. The witness herself had backed off and said, hey, listen, I don't mean to suggest for a second that this was coerced or forced in any way. She backtracked immediately when she heard how that might have sounded. And for some reason, today, I don't know how much time Ms. Necheles spent on this, on cross—examination, drilling it over and over and over again into the jury's ears. I don't understand the reason for that. With regard to your concerns about this, the numbness in the hands and this feeling that she didn't know what was going on and the room spinning, you will recall that at a bench conference, Ms. Hoffinger asked that the People be permitted to ask a question about a moment that came years later, with what was referred to as a Bombshell moment, and that that would explain a lot of the things that she had not mentioned originally, that she had remembered later on, and some of her emotions that she was feeling, I asked Ms. Hoffinger, what are you referring to? What are you talking about? And she said she was specifically referring to the movie Bombshell. And which is —— which chronicled Roger Ailes and certain allegations of sexual —— of a sexual nature made against him. And, apparently, Ms. Daniels had watched this movie years later and it was at that point that certain memories came back and certain explanations came back to her for her feelings. I ruled immediately that that could not come in. I felt that to somehow inject Roger Ailes into these proceedings would be unduly prejudicial to your client and I did so even though these feelings of the numbness of hands, the room spinning, the blacking out went unexplained. And I did that to protect your client. I disagree with your narrative that there is any new account here. I disagree that there is any change in story. What's happened is people have gone into more detail than they originally planned. And I do agree that certain details, although I may have originally disagreed on Tuesday, certain details such as the color of the floor tiles, the description of the furniture in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture, these details add a sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them. And the fact that you went after her right on opening statements, attacking whether —— attacking, your claim that they never had sex, you didn't attack that there was a falsification of business records, you didn't attack any of the other elements of the offense, you said my client denies that there was ever a sexual encounter. Again, as I said before, right off the bat, that puts your client's word against Ms. Daniels' word. And that, in my mind, allows the People to do what they can to rehabilitate her and to corroborate her story. Your motion for a mistrial is denied. I will see you tomorrow at 9:30."

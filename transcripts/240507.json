And you placed some limits on testimony regarding Karen McDougal and incidents in June, but no limits on the testimony of Stormy Daniels, obviously, recognizing that her testimony and the narrative completes the story of, you know, the events that precipitated the payoff shortly before the election. The details of the encounter, your Honor, are important. The defense has opened already on her credibility and reasons for why she did what she did. They have cited money that she has made on other things. And it's important for us to establish her credibility here. So, therefore, the details are important. We have been careful, your Honor, to omit certain details that might be too salacious. We can, at some point, if you would like, list the things that we are omitting, although I don't think that it's necessary for me to do that in open court. But the general details of what occurred, including the sex act, barring certain details that are unnecessary, are a significant part of the story, but also very important for us in terms of her credibility."

They sent checks in the amounts from fifty cents to five dollars to a list of millionaires throughout the country. I received a check for fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. They may call that cheap; I call it watching the bottom line.\" \"Every dollar counts in business, and for that matter, every dime. Penny pinching? You bet. I'm all for it.\" \"As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged.\" Can you.....thank you. \"There is human (and now computer) error everywhere —— at restaurants, at the phone company, at the grocery store, at hotels —— and you'd be surprised by how much this human error can cost you.\" \"Don't be obsessive about it, but check through your bills from time to time.\" \"You should also always feel comfortable bargaining for goods and services.\" \"I do it all the time, and I'm one of the richest men on earth.\" \"Even in high—end shops, I bargain. After all, the more you're paying for something, the more the seller should be able to shave off the price.\" \"I hate paying retail, and it makes me cringe when I see other people doing it. I've walked into stores and offered $2,000 dollars for a $10,000 dollar item.\" \"It can be embarrassing for me (especially since everyone knows that I'm Trump and that I'm wealthy), but you'd be amazed at the discounts you can get if you simply ask.\" \"You do have to be willing to walk away, but after you've walked away a few times, the price will come down.\" \"I understand that penny—pinching can have a negative connotation ——as in 'miserly'—— but when you calculate how much ten cents on a price can matter if you multiply it by a hundred thousand or a million, the value of ten cents becomes clear.\" \"For instance, let's say I have to buy one hundred thousand light bulbs for all of the buildings that I own and maintain each year. If I manage to save ten cents on each light bulb, that's a savings of ten thousand dollars per year!\" \"That's ten thousand dollars I can put toward another building or another investment or donate to a cause that needs the money more than I do.\" \"Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances such as percentages and cents. Numbers that seem trivial add up and have enormous implications.\" \"My parents hammered frugality into me at an early age, and it's the most important money—management skill a person can use. Call it penny—pinching if you want to; I call it financial smarts.\""

And so I think it's important to bring out partly how she was feeling at the time, because it explains that. And, again, the defense opened the door from the start to credibility issues. This is the account that would have been told to the American people had she not entered into the NDA. She entered into the NDA willingly, but had she not entered into the NDA, this is what would have been told to the American people. And that's why they wanted to pay her to remain silent."

So I started dancing on the weekends, which was actually kind of cool because I didn't have to miss any classes and could still make more in two nights than I did shoveling manure eight hours a day.

For those that don't know, it's like traveling acts that come in, and they headline at the club. They put on very fancy burlesque shows. They either breathe fire or do aerial, stilts, just like they are the star performance and they give them all the special treatment. And because I had this background in actual dancing, and I was like, I want to do that, but you have to have some sort of —— a reason to be the headliner. You have to have a reason they pay you to come in and be the star. And the way to do that is either to pose for magazines or do competitions or to do adult movies. So, if you are a regular girl in the club, you can come and perform, but if you were like in Playboy, or Playboy centerfolds, or one of those people, then you could be a headliner. So, you would have to have what they would call credentials or credits. And so, I asked a lot of those performers how they got those, and, of course, they said you have to have these credits or a reason to be the star. And they connected me with some photographers and videographers, and I went on to pose for some magazines to get the accolades, I guess, to be able to go on tour as the featured entertainer."

They top out on a pay grade, and the people who make the most for their appearances were the people who, the girls, performers who had done adult films. And I topped out of rate and was doing really well. I never had any sort of issue with nudity or sex or adult films. Went to California with a girlfriend of mine who was out there to do a shoot. And she obviously just wanted me to go with her, and I never went to California. She said, I will pay for your trip. I am so scared. So I went with her. I was an extra, like a completely clothed background extra, in a bar on her shoots. And the director, who is a very famous director, from a famous adult company, Wicked Pictures, saw me, and said he actually thought I was already an adult actress and asked me if I would be in another movie. I honestly was kind of scared to do it. And she said, I will do it with you, and just doing one you can say you have done it, and it bumps you up in pay grade. So I said, yes. And I will cut out a lot of the other details, and five days later she got on a plane to fly back home, and I got offered a contract at Wicked Pictures."

So, I did explain to him like different types of adult films, some are scripted. Some budgets are $5,000 and some budgets are $250. I explained that there is such a budget range and how I got involved in it. He was very interested in a lot of the business aspects of it, which I thought was very cool. He asked questions like, are there any unions? Do you get residuals? How are the people paid? Do you get health insurance? What about testing? Are you worried about STD’s? Do they have a doctor on staff? You know, most of the time, I am trying to be very careful and not say bad words. Most of the people who want to talk to me about work, they want to know the sexy stuff, or the dirty stuff. What's your favorite position? They want to know the salacious things.

And it was at that point he got really quiet, and he was thinking, and he told me he had an idea, that I should go on his television show."

He said, you remind me of my daughter because she is smart and blond and beautiful and people under estimate her as well. And the way he framed it did actually make perfect sense, because he is all about like PR things, the spin.

    "text": "Yes, your Honor. Thank you. We move for a mistrial based on the testimony this morning. Your Honor, there are a couple of different reasons, but what's clear is that the Court set guardrails for this testimony. And the guardrails by this witness, answering questions from the Government, were just thrown to the side. And there is no way to unring the bell, in our view, and that the testimony that came in was so unduly and inappropriately prejudicial to President Trump and the actual charges that are at issue in this case that there is no remedy that we can fashion or we believe the Court can fashion to unring this bell. I mean, the testimony, your Honor, about the alleged incident back in 2006, a lot of the testimony that this witness talked about today is way different than the story that she was pedaling in 2016, your Honor. Which is, from my understanding of what the ADAs said this morning, the only reason why this evidence is even admissible, right, is to talk about the information that was supposedly kept from the voters in 2016. There was testimony today about being blacked out; about not wearing a condom, which was after there was testimony from the —— from her employer that you had to wear a condom; that there was always —— that there was always a condom worn; the height of the two individuals; the fact that —— you know, the things like the spacing in the room; the fact that there is a bodyguard outside the room; the power dynamics. She testified —— the question was: Do you want out of the trailer park? And all of this has nothing to do with this case. And it's extraordinarily prejudicial and it's something that is —— the only reason why the Government asked those questions, aside from pure embarrassment, is to —— is to inflame this jury to not —— to not look at the evidence that matters, but to just hear from this witness. And on top of that, your Honor, even after the incident, there was testimony about a second alleged sexual advance sometime later on. Totally irrelevant to this case. And there is no reason that should have been elicited, your Honor. Again, we don't even know that that's coming, because we don't get notes of what this witness has said in prep. The last one we got was from last year, your Honor. She testified that there was communications with President Trump afterwards and that she thought something bad was going to happen and that she was worried about not being safe. She then repeatedly testified about purported alleged meetings with President Trump, and with every single one she qualified that it was in an open place, in a public place. What's the jury to do with that? And for many of those you sustained objections to, Judge, and that is true, but it was said repeatedly; and the jury hears it. And I am sure that the transcript will say \"objection sustained,\" by your Honor, but it's still extraordinarily prejudicial to insert safety and safety concerns into a trial about business records. And, you know, I know your Honor knows this, but this is exactly what President Trump was —— what we raised with the Court, seeking an adjournment based upon Ms. Daniels' changed testimony. For years, including up to 2016, which is —— which is when she was pedaling this story, she talked about a consensual encounter with President Trump that she was trying to sell. That's what Mr. Davidson talked about. That's purportedly what Mr. Cohen was told. And that's not the story that we heard today. We heard a completely different story. And the reason why that matters is because, of course, we are going to cross—examine her on the fact that her story has changed. And I'm sure the Government will then say we've opened the door and then they can then go ahead and ask even more questions about what she wants to say about what happened in 2006. But, it's so prejudicial in a case about an NDA and whether there were false records placed on The Trump Organization's books in 2017. And, you know, I think your Honor knew that this was an issue by setting up guardrails along the way and this morning. But now we've heard it. And it is an issue. And it's not —— how can you unring the bell? And we are going to cross—examine her shortly, presumably, and talk about —— and then elicit the fact that she denied twice. There were articles that said that she denied it, that she denied this took place. But, that's not really the issue. I mean, that's going to be the cross. The issue is she has testified today about consent, about danger. That's not the point of this case. That's not the point of her testimony. And that's not what she was pedaling, that‘s not —— I'm sorry —— not what she was pedaling, that's not the story that she was selling in 2016; and now we're here. I mean, the least of which is the fact that just over lunch, people are already reporting —— everybody is reporting that she's suggesting consent. Again, that's a new fact, and it's extraordinarily prejudicial. And the mere fact that she says there was consent, after saying she blacked out, doesn't remember anything, they only had water, but she doesn't remember anything, this is the kind of testimony that makes it impossible to come back from. I mean, you know, not even talking about the fact that we are talking about somebody who is going to go out and campaign this afternoon and how unfair it is in that environment, as well. But, the Government must have known this was coming out. And it's just, you know —— we sit here listening to it. And we objected to it the best that we could. But, you know, this has nothing to do with the reason why we're here, your Honor. And even the limited fact that she signed the NBA, the limited fact that she was selling this story over the years, including at the time of the election, that's not what we heard today. That's not how the evidence came in from this witness. Of course, your Honor cut her off several times, but there was so much —— and we haven't looked at the transcript to give all of the examples. And we are happy to do so if that's helpful. But, how can we come back from this in a way that's fair to President Trump and in a way to make sure that this process stays exactly where it should be, which is about whether there were false records on The Trump Organization's books and put on in 2017? So, we believe, regrettably, that there should be a mistrial; and that to the extent that there is another trial, that this witness is either excluded or that her testimony is extremely limited to the guardrails, frankly, that your Honor set this morning."

    "text": "Yes. Thank you, your Honor. Again, I would just note, this was fully briefed by the defense in their motions in limine. And your Honor did not put any guardrails on her testimony. Recognizing, of course, that this completes her account —— her account completes the narrative of the events that precipitated the falsification of business records. And this story, your Honor, her account is highly probative of the defendant's intent, his intent and his motive in paying this off, and making sure that the American public did not hear this before the election. It is precisely what the defendant did not want to become public. I will say, without getting into too many details, that Mr. Blanche's recitation of the fact that this is entirely new is not true. I will say that, and I'm sure that he knows this, that the account and things like the fact that a condom was not used has been out there for a very, very long time. This is not new. This is not a new account. Now, there were certain details that I told your Honor that she remembered after a movie in 2019, and I was going to elicit that. You asked me not to, and I did not. But, you know, the other thing is, Judge, they opened the door to this. So, the 2011 threat to her was opened on not only in their opening when they talked about legal fees and that she was changing —— you know, coming up with this story, because she's an opportunist, out to make money and that she owes Mr. Trump legal fees. So, they opened the door. That's the subject of the defamation case. Second, they specifically put in an exhibit which was admitted in evidence, through Keith Davidson's testimony, where they referenced this threat in 2011, saying that it was not true. And, so, it was incumbent upon us to bring out those details in her direct, again, to rehabilitate credibility where they attacked it both during Keith Davidson's testimony and on opening. So, your Honor, we were extremely mindful of not eliciting too much testimony about the actual act. We did it initially before your Honor even asked us to carve it back. Additionally, so there were details that were left out based on the Court's instructions at the bench. They were additional details that were not brought out. But, your Honor, this —— stating that this is an entirely new story is not accurate. And I'm certain that when they cross—examine Ms. Daniels, some of this will come out, and some of this will come out on redirect. And I know that your Honor has mentioned that you will allow me to elicit some of it on redirect in terms of what issues came up publicly and what details were remembered at different times based on different things. But they opened the door to the threat in 2011. And now your Honor has asked us to discuss a limiting instruction on that, and we can certainly do that. We have written one that we have written up quickly that we can discuss with defense counsel, if they would like that. But, your Honor, this goes directly to her credibility, which they attacked and while I'm sure will continue to attack, they opened the door in their opening, they opened the door in Keith Davidson's testimony, and these are not all new details. But, at the end of the day, your Honor, this is what defendant was trying to hide. And in terms of the payoff in 2016 before the election. This is an exhibit. If you were —— if you would, of what they were trying —— what Mr. Trump wanted to make sure didn't get disclosed. We have carved back details. We have been mindful of your Honor's decision. And we have carved it back even before them, so I don't think there is any basis for a mistrial, your Honor."

The point of the argument is that the reason why this evidence, in theory, is admissible, over our objection, is because this is —— these, in theory, are the facts which was presented to Mr. Davidson and Mr. Cohen so that they could evaluate whether they could enter into an NDA and, supposedly, the fact and the details that were going to be kept from the American people in 2016. That's the theory for this evidence coming in. The problem is that isn't what came in. And so what —— instead, what came in is this extraordinarily prejudicial testimony that has changed over time. And we can't fix that except to cross—examine her, but it's still —— it has nothing to do with the case. The voters decided in 2016. The People are going to make a lot of that in their summation, I expect. And, Judge, I don't think anybody, anybody can listen to what that witness said and think that that has anything to do with the charged conduct. And it's the kind of testimony that's so prejudicial that you have to run —— you run the very high risk of the jury —— of the jury not being able to focus on the evidence that actually does matter."

I think that there are some areas that would have been better if the People did not go into them. In fairness to the People, I think the witness was a little difficult to control. And that's why I was permitting some leading, to give them the opportunity to try to control the witness. It was not easy. Having said that, I do think that there were guardrails in place. I do think that the Court instructed the Prosecution that there were certain details that we don't need to get into. And, again, I'm not dismissing what you are saying. I do think that there were some things that were better left unsaid. Having said that, I don't believe we are at the point where a mistrial is warranted. There are a few things that go along with that. I will note that where there were objections, the objections, for the most part, were sustained. Where there was a motion to strike testimony, for the most part, that motion was granted as well. I will also note that I was surprised that there were not more objections at various times during the testimony. And, in fact, at one point the Court sua sponte objected because there was no objection coming from the defense. So, when you say that, you know, the bell has been rung, the defense has to take some responsibility for that. The Court has done everything that I can possibly do to protect both sides and to ensure fairness and that‘s why, again, I objected on my own. Whether these are new stories or not new stories, the remedy is on cross—examination. And, in fact, if they are new stories, the more fodder that I will expect to see on cross—examination, if you have any. I also believe —— if you want, I will give a limiting instruction regarding the incident at the parking lot in 2011. Just bear with me one moment."

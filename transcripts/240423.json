        "text": "Judge, as an initial matter, I am going to hand to the Court, and to counsel, a set of documents. The documents numbered 1 through 10 are the alleged violations. They are all documents that were part of my affirmation, but just to make this part of the record of this proceeding, I am handing a copy to the Court and a copy to counsel. There are also four additional documents that I may refer to in there separately. I would also note that there is a 9A. So one of the posts, post number 9, Exhibit 9, is the landing page of the Truth Social post which is a newspaper article that the defendant posted. 9A is sort of a better version of that article which is what you would see if you clicked on that article in Truth Social. It would blow it up into a better printout so that it is readable. Judge, each of the 10 posts that I just handed the Court and counsel violate the order restricting extrajudicial statements that this Court issued on April 1st. That order amended the Court's initial order on March 26th of 2024. Eight of the violative posts were on the defendant's Truth Social account at Real Donald Trump. Two of the posts were on his official campaign website Donald J. Trump dot com. Each of them violates the Court's April lst order which is a lawful order of this Court. In that order the Court found that the types of extrajudicial statements at issue pose a very real threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings by intimidating both defendant's direct targets, as well as others who may be called upon to participate in these proceedings and who, rightly, fear being subject for vitriol and sort of the undertow affect that we worry about. Here, the defendant sought an emergency stay in the First Department, and I will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. That application was denied on April 9th, the application for the stay and the next day the post at issue here started. Defendant has violated this order repeatedly and he hasn't stopped. I just want to note for the record that yesterday, here in this building, right outside those doors, in a pen setup from which he has daily conducted press conferences on his way into and out of the courtroom, the defendant violated the order again on camera. He did it right here in the hallway outside. He said, among other things, they didn't say you building a building, and this is a transcript, they didn't say you building a building and called a payment to a lawyer because as you know Cohen is a lawyer. He represented a lot of people over the years. I am not the only one and he wasn't very good in a lot of ways in terms of misrepresentation. But he represented a lot of people. But he puts in an invoice or whatever, a bill, and calls it a legal expense, and I got indicted for that. He later went on and said, and what are they going to look at? All the lies that Cohen did in the last trial? He got caught lying in the last trial. So he got caught lying, pure lying and what are they going to look at? That? We will be filing another Order to Show Cause for this violation later today. The Court has warned the Defendant, his attacks on witnesses clearly violate the order willfully and flagrantly. The Court should now hold him in contempt for each of the 10 posts. The initial Decision and Order on March 26th, restricting extrajudicial statements was issued after the People demonstrated a long history of attacks on all the participants in the judicial process here and in other jurisdictions, witnesses, jurors, judges, lawyers, family members. No one is off limits to the defendant and he can attack and seek to intimidate anyone he wants to in service to himself. On April lst, the Court issued a second order restricting the defendant's extrajudicial statements. That order, your Honor, was issued because after the March 26th order the defendant ratcheted up attacks on family members who were not covered by that March 26th order. Among other things, the April 1st order prevents the Defendant from making or directing others to make public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding. And in a second relevant provision, prevents the defendant from making or directing others to make public statements about any prospective juror or any juror in this criminal proceeding. The defendant was warned that he would face sanctions under Judiciary Law 750, (a) (3) and 751 if he violated, and here we are. Judge, I am going to go through the violations of the 10 posts that I just handed up. The first violation was on April 10, 2024, at 10:07 a.m. The defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that reproduced a social media post by Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer of Stormy Daniels who was later convicted of stealing from her. The Avenatti post stated, we can't be hypocrites when it comes to the First Amendment. It is outrageous that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews, post on social and make money on bogus documentaries, all by talking shit about Trump, but he's gagged and threatened with jail if he responds. To that the defendant added in his own words, thank you to Michael Avenatti for revealing the truth about two sleazebags who have with their lies and misrepresentations cost our country dearly. The second post that same day ——"

        "text": "Thank you. April 10, 2024 at 10:48 a.m., the defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that contained a picture of a document and that document, by the way, will be at issue in this case. The document was entitled, Official Statement of Stormy Daniels, dated January 30,2018, which refers to facts that are directly at issue here. The defendant accompanied the picture with his own statement, look what was just found from a fake news reporter. Again, Judge, that is a document with respect to the first subsection in the order. It is a document that relates to a reasonably foreseeable witness in this proceeding. It is a document that relates, specifically, to things that she'll testify about in this proceeding. And so, I don't think there is any other interpretation of that post, again, posted five days before jury selection, than that it relates to this proceeding. On April 13, 2024, at 12:56 p.m., the defendant posted a post on his Truth Social account and stated, has Mark Pomerantz been prosecuted for his terrible acts in and out of the DA's Office. Has disgraced attorney and felon, Michael Cohen, been prosecuted for lying. Only Trump people get prosecuted by this judge and these thugs. A dark day for our country. MAGA 2024. Here again, Judge, Michael Cohen is a reasonably foreseeable witness. Throughout the pendency of this case defendant and others have tried to make Mark Pomerantz somehow an issue in this case. This is, again, going after Michael Cohen's credibility, which is a recurring theme in these posts and, frankly, was a theme yesterday in the opening statement for this case. And so, I think it's pretty clear now that we are two days before jury selection and the defendant is again going after Michael Cohen. On April 15, 2024 at 9:12 a.m., and this is while the defendant was likely in the courthouse, the defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that stated, a serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor against Trump in an embarrassment for the New York Legal System. The post contained a link to an article in the New York Post. Clearly a reference to Michael Cohen. Clearly a reference to this proceeding. And so, I think, again, that link to the order is pretty clear with respect to this post. That same day, about an hour and 15 minutes later, the defendant posted the same post again on his Truth Social account. And for the same reasons, it is clearly related to these proceedings and to a reasonably foreseeable witness in the case. Again, that same day, April 15, 2024, on his official campaign website, just to make sure the word fully got out, the defendant published a link to an article from the New York Post with the following introduction, ICYMI, which my understanding is it means, in case you missed it, and then a colon, and then the same link that he had posted twice previously that day, a serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor against Trump in an embarrassment for the New York Legal System. Again, specific reference both to this proceeding and to a reasonably foreseeable witness in the case. The next day on April 16, 2024, and we are on Exhibit 7 that I handed up, so I should have been giving those numbers as I went along. On April 16, 2024, 1:50 in the afternoon, the defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that stated, it's, again, the same post that we have just been referring to and it contained the same link to the article. That same day on his official campaign website, he again posted the, in case you missed it, with the link to the serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor against Trump in an embarrassment to the New York Legal System. Again, those are so clearly related to a reasonably foreseeable witness in this proceeding. On April 16, 7:09 p.m. —— the other thing to keep in mind, and I know your Honor knows this, I am just going to say it for the record, this is while we are on trial. The trial has now begun. On April 16th, at 7:09 p.m., the defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that contained an article attacking the testimony of Michael Cohen. The article had a picture of Michael Cohen with the headline, no, Cohen's guilty pleas does not prove Trump committed campaign finance crimes. The entire article was embedded in the post. And, again, that's what I handed up as 9A. If you clicked on various parts of the article, the particular page of the article would come up in a more readable form. The whole thing was visible when you clicked into Truth. And, again, reasonably foreseeable witness, direct reference to this proceeding, very clear link to the order that this Court issued on April 1st. The next day, and this was last Wednesday, April 17th, and, again, this is a very troubling post at 5:46 p.m., the defendant published a post on his Truth Social account that stated, they are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump jury. I want to give the court a little bit of context for that Truth. And that is a quote. That whole thing is in quotation marks. It's attributed to somebody named Jesse Watters. On that day, last Wednesday, there was a segment on a Fox News show called, At Five, that airs at 5:00 in the afternoon. On that show Jesse Watters, who is one of the commentators, spoke about the jurors who had been seated or were being interviewed in this case in a derogatory way. Mr. Watters said the first part of what Mr. Trump posted. He said the first part, in order to get on the Trump jury. Now, Mr. Watters may have said things like, in order to get on the Trump jury, later in that episode or later that night when he has another show at 8:00, but he didn't say it at 5:08 on his show, and this post came at 5:46, about 30 minutes later, give or take."

What was in the quotation on the defendant's Truth was, they are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump jury. So it is a hybrid of something somebody else said together with something the defendant, apparently, added on his own. I think the link to the jurors in this case, to this proceeding, I think it's very clearly a violation of your order on April 1st and so, that deals with that. The other piece I want to add to that is if you, I am sure, again, I am sure you remember, but for the record, this was last Wednesday evening, that this was going on and Mr. Watters in his segment was giving lots of details about the various jurors. The next day was the day juror two came in and said, I don't think I can be on this anymore because of publicity and things she was hearing from friends and acquaintances and everything else, so we ended up losing a juror. What happened here is precisely what this order was designed to prevent, and this defendant doesn't care. The burden here, Judge, is on us. And, Judge, that's the 10 posts. I don't know if you have any questions specifically about those or I was going to move on."

        "text": "The burden here is on us to show the existence of a lawful order expressing an unequivocal mandate, a violation of the order, and that the violation was made with knowledge and is willful beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court's Order of April lst, is clear and unequivocal and it is lawful. It has been challenged a couple of times here and it was challenged in the First Department. A stay was denied. One of the bases for issuing a stay would be possibility or likelihood of success. That stay was denied. There is ongoing litigation there, but right now this is a lawful order in front of this Court. He violates the order when he posts about known witnesses or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their participation in this criminal proceeding and he violates the order when he posts about a juror or prospective juror. And, Judge, that language is a broad prohibition with respect to the jurors, about statements about the jury here. It is not limited to a statement about a particularly identifiable juror. Counsel in their papers inserts the word, individual, in the filing on page seven in an effort to argue that this provision is ambiguous. The order is clear, notwithstanding the defendant's willingness to make arguments that conflict with the facts and at times with each other. And the clarity is stark with respect to this provision related to jurors, particularly when contrasted to the more specific language that modifies witnesses, the Court and DANY personnel. Judge, 1 would just refer to some of the language. And I won't read it, some of the language in the Court's April 1st order, talking about why it is so important to issue that order now based on the defendant's history, based on this proceeding, and based on what was going on. There is no doubt that this defendant made these statements. And I just want to talk a little bit more about the back and forth on that last post, the 10th post with Jesse Watters because I think those two —— the defendant's willfulness in these posts, defendant took something that Jesse Watters said, added to it and posted it. And it came from a segment specifically discussing juror profiles in this case. He did it about 40 minutes after Jesse Watters said part of the statement. To me, that shows very clear deliberation and willfulness in making the post. All of the posts here are made concerning this criminal proceeding. We know that from the proximity. We know that from the words. We know that because they are consistent with the defense in this case as outlined in counsel's opening yesterday. It's very clear that they relate to this case. I am not sure how there could be a straight—faced argument that these posts, all within the last 12 days or so, some of them echoed in counsel's opening yesterday, relate to anything other than this criminal proceeding. Throwing MAGA into a post doesn't make it political. It may make it more ominous. Defendant's 10 posts at issue today are willful violations of the Court's order on April lst. The defendant knows the terms of the April lst order. He has repeatedly complained about the order on his social media account, including, among others, and I handed the posts up in the packet that I handed up of the 10 violations, there is a post from April 2nd, from April 6th and from April 10th and 11th."

If you clicked it, it is a video in which the defendant is actually speaking about the Gag Order and the fact that kind of what he says is he is gagged but he is referring to it. He refers to the order's restrictions and attacks the Court as conflicted. The defendant has engaged in multiple rounds of briefing involving the April 1st order and its earlier version, the March 26th order, including filings in this court and in the Appellate Division up to and including his response to this Order to Show Cause on Friday, on the 19th. In each, the defendant has engaged in details with the order—specific directives, his Appellate Division filings specifically criticizes and seeks to prohibit enforcement of the April 1st order's restrictions on his extrajudicial statements regarding Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. In paragraph nine of the defendant's verified Article 78 Petition, filed by counsel, they complain that the article —— that the April 1st order forbids the defendant from responding to so—called attacks by Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. And yet, that's part of their argument here is that he is allowed to respond to these attacks. So in the First Department they are saying he's forbidden. He knows. He is forbidden. That's what the order says. And yet, they want to come now and claim and muddy the waters and say, Judge, well, we can respond to attacks. There is no provision in this order for responding to attacks. They have repeatedly cited to a line in which the Court does say that the defendant can respond to political attacks and try to morph them into a massive exception to the order, which it is not and it is clearly not and the Court should not be swayed by that. I would also just note that this is not the first time there have been filings in different courts with inconsistent representations or assertions and I submit that they can't be taken seriously. When we examine the defendant's words and his actions, it is clear that he knows about the order, he knows what he is not allowed to do and he does it anyway. There can't be any question that he is aware of what the order requires and that knowledge alone indicates that his disobedience of the order is willful. It's intentional. Even if his asserted ability to respond to attacks can be used as political or based in fact on the order, and it is not. There is no indication that his claim that he is responding to attacks is anything more than an after the facts justification for his contumacious behavior. It is not clear at all that he was aware of the posts he claims he was responding to at the time he made the post that violates the Court's order. Nothing on the face of the post indicates that. By his logic, if someone covered by the order says something mean or not nice about him, he can respond because the attack is political, I suppose, because by talking about the defendant, the speaker is a public figure or because the defendant is running for office, again, it makes no sense. He says whatever he needs to say to get the results that he wants. It's tortured at best and would eviscerate the clear language and meaning of this order if the Court were to adopt that. The Court and the People have made clear that the April 1st order leaves the defendant substantial room to engage in speech about this criminal proceeding, including criticisms of the Court and District Attorney. The defendant has shown his ability to understand the significant leeway left to him by making multiple social media posts and other public statements that criticize the criminal trial without violating the April 1st order. By going beyond those criticism and launching specific, separate attacks on two witnesses and by attacking prospective jurors or juror, the defendant is nothing less than knowingly and willfully, that is intentionally, breaching the crystal clear, unequivocal lines set by this Court in the April 1st order to protect the integrity of this proceeding. I am just going to talk a little bit about another argument that the defendant made in his papers where he claims that what he calls, reposts, are not his statements. In fact, some of his most dangerous statements, including one we brought to the Court's attention as early as arraignments last year, that photo of the defendant holding the bat at the head of the District Attorney, are what he wants to carve out of the order by calling them reposts. That flies in the face of common sense and I am going to draw an analogy which is not perfect but I think is helpful. New York Defamation Law has made clear for over a hundred years that one who repeats or otherwise republishes a defamatory matter is subject to liability as if he had originally published it. That's Geraci versus Probst, 15 New York 3rd 336. And I can hand up copies if you like. I will do that at the end."

And as the Court noted the other day, the law is clear that a party may not challenge a Court's order by violating it. Your Honor, the Judiciary Law authorizes the Court to impose a fine not exceeding a thousand dollar or to sentence the contemnor to no more than 30 days jail or both in the discretion of the Court. That is in Judiciary Law 751, and that's for each finding of contempt. We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty. The defendant seems to be angling for that. For today, for these 10 violations of this Court's April 1st Order, we are asking the Court to impose the maximum number, $1,000 fine for each of the 10 violations. We are also asking the Court to order the Defendant to remove all 10 offending posts, eight from his Truth Social account, and two from his campaign website, to take those down. Finally, for the Court to again warn the defendant that this conduct will not be tolerated and remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary. The defendant is having his day in court. Unfortunately, he is still doing everything he can to undermine this process. It has to stop. A finding of criminal contempt, imposition of sanctions and stark warnings from this Court are the minimum remedies necessary to try to stop the defendant from engaging in this behavior. Thank you."

There is no dispute that President Trump is facing a barrage of political attacks from all sides, including from the two witnesses who are referenced in the early posts. And I am going to separate, your Honor, if I can, the reposts from the first round of alleged violations involving the Avenatti comment and the comment regarding Mr. Cohen not being convicted of perjury and the comments about Ms. Clifford and Mr. Cohen. Okay. Those comments, those three posts, were in direct response to comments made by these witnesses, not about these criminal proceedings, your Honor, not about their testimony at the witness stand and President Trump's comments back to them was not about their testimony from the witness stand."

But he's talking about his company Truth Social and he says: \"But when I put out a statement or message\" —— and I'm not sure what the distinction is in his mind —— \"it is spread all over the place, fast and furious. Everybody seems to get whatever I have to say and quickly.\" So that's what we know about what the defendant thinks of his use of Truth Social. Judge, there is a lawful order here. It's very clear. The defendant has violated it willfully and knowingly by posting these posts. And we are asking the Court to hold him in contempt."

I have had a great relationship with Mr. Trump over the years, starting in the —— when, starting in '89, I had an idea of creating a magazine called Trump Style, and I presented it to Mr. Trump. And he liked the idea a lot, and just questioned me who was going to pay for it, because magazines are pretty expensive. So I told him, I said, Mr. Trump, you have all of these hotels, all of these casinos, all of these apartments, you basically have a fixed distribution. So he liked the idea, and we went ahead and launched the magazine on a quarterly basis. And I would see Mr. Trump probably once a quarter at that time to get the cover approved and the content approved."

And he would always advise me of parties or events or things that I would either go to or send, at that time, my editors to, that was prior to the National Enquirer. And then when I bought the National Enquirer in March of 1999, one of the first calls that I received was from Mr. Trump. He called me and he says, congratulations, he says, you bought a great magazine. And he knew over the years the Editor—in—Chief and a few of the editors at the National Enquirer."

And he was always kind enough to send me the content, show the ratings and I was able to publish that in the National Enquirer and some of the other magazines and I received all that content. Obviously, I didn't have to pay for it. And it was a great mutual, beneficial relationship because all of the press about the show and how it was doing was all published also along that time. Then in 2003 or 2004, when Mr. Trump launched The Celebrity Apprentice, then our relationship even started to grow even further because the celebrities that he was firing on the show and the amount of press that the show received and the incredible ratings that it had and what I believed it did for Mr. Trump as a national figure on TV as The Boss did a tremendous—also help for my magazines, because they, the audience of the National Enquirer and the other celebrity magazines loved Mr. Trump as a major celebrity and followed it, followed him religiously, I should say. Then I would add on that all of the —— a lot of content on the show, whether somebody was going to be fired or terminated or there was some controversy he would have, as the publisher, Mr. Trump was kind enough to give me the information first; so it was very beneficial for my magazines.

They're being offered for their truth. There's also been no notice that the Government considers Mr. Bannon to be a co—conspirator in this case. As the Court knows, there is no conspiracy charged in the indictment. Statements by a campaign staff member doing normal campaign work do not further any alleged conspiracy that the People are relying on as a predicate act. And the limiting instruction that you are giving with respect to the newspaper articles could not adequately cure the risk of prejudice when we're talking about testimony from statements like this. It's just very far afield from what the charges are in this case, what has been alleged before this line was elicited about how this conspiracy functioned. And so the reason I asked for the sidebar, it's difficult on a question—by—question basis, other than just continually, we think this whole line is inadmissible."

It's not a statement that is being offered for the truth. It is, as I suggested at the bench, much more akin to a verbal act. Moreover, and let me just say, I think that we've gotten enough on this topic, so I don't really need to go back into it. This may be moot. I do see this coming up. Counsel said it yesterday in the opening, and Mr. Bove said it again, and I think there is a misperception about the law and about what this case is about. It is true that there is no conspiracy charge on the indictment. However, as the Court is aware, Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree requires an intent to defraud, that includes the intent to commit or conceal another crime. The primary crime that we have alleged is New York State Election Law Section 17—152. There is conspiracy language in the statute. In that statute it reads: \"Any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon by one or more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" So while it's true that there is no conspiracy in the second degree charge on the indictment, it is not true that a conspiracy has not always been alleged to be part of this case. The entire case is predicated on the idea that there was a conspiracy to influence the election in 2016. Mr. Bove may interpret some of the evidence in a way that is different from the way that we interpret it, but that's what the jury's role is, to interpret what the nature and scope of that conspiracy was. This is evidence that will aid them in making that determination."

There is no misperception on this side about the predicate that Mr. Steinglass just talked about. I think what the issue is, that the existence of a conspiracy argument is not the sole requirement for the hearsay exception we're talking about. The statement that is being offered also has to further the conspiracy at issue. I don't think there is any basis for a conclusion that what was just elicited from Mr. Pecker regarding Mr. Bannon is furthering the conspiracy that is alleged as the predicate to the charges in the indictment. What that was, I submit, is very normal standard campaign work. And I agree with Mr. Steinglass, that is the type of thing that will come up throughout the trial. That predicate should not be used as an excuse to shovel in hearsay from witnesses who will testify at the trial."

True, that in and of itself might not be criminal, we can have much debate back and forth on this. In connection with all of the other evidence in the case and the robust components of the agreement that was forged at Trump Tower to influence the election, that was a piece of it. The evidence doesn't have to be conclusive to be admissible. It has to be relevant, and it's relevant to this idea of the conspiracy, whether Mr. Bove has a proved innocent explanation for it or not."

First, I think that there —— that the fact that it's a business record may mean that conversations among employees about business—related matters are admissible because they're business records, even if —— otherwise, there would be no business record. Everything in a business record is, arguably, an out—of—court statement being offered for the truth. So, I do think that, for example, if a person who was a party to a conversation was not under a business duty to do so accurately, that would be embedded hearsay, and that would need to find another exception to the hearsay rule. I believe the primary exception to the hearsay rule on which we would rely is co—conspirator hearsay. And I believe the testimony of Mr. Pecker has already established a prima facie case of conspiracy, so that statements made in the business records that are in furtherance of that conspiracy would be admissible, in addition, on those grounds. But, I think —— I —— I am suggesting, gently, that it would be an uncharitable view of the business records exception to suggest that every statement contained in a business record has to be independently admissible under some objection other than business records."

I spoke with Giuliani yesterday and he told me the following: He said he spoke with Stephen Ryan of McDermott Will & Emery, Mike's current attorney, and he and Jay Sekulow will be meeting with Ryan in Washington on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. He indicated that the President was paying for McDermott Will & Emery to review the documentation for the attorney—client privilege issues. He may have meant Trump Enterprises, but he did say that the President —— he also said the President was satisfied with Ryan and MWE was the right group to go through all of the documents, but after that he wanted more aggressive lawyers representing Cohen, us. He said the President was being charged $200,000 by MWE for the document review and that Jay Sekulow told Trump that was an outrageously large fee. I spoke with Giuliani about the text message that I had sent him the previous Friday, in which I outlined the argument that Mueller had already found that there was no Russian collusion with Michael Cohen because after doing all of this investigation, last November, he transferred the case to the Southern District. I said that it was important to reverse the Avenatti—created Russian spin to the Cohen investigation, and the best way to do that was to use Mueller's investigation to our own advantage. He loved the idea and thought it was very important to get that message out there. But he thought he should not do that because it would look like he is defending Michael Cohen. He said Ryan wouldn't do that and, in any event, Ryan was the wrong guy for that, but I was the right guy for that. He said the President is tired of Ryan and will no longer fund Ryan once the document review is completed."

Many of them are already writing that you are cooperating. This strategy has been consistent from the start to put pressure on you into believing that you are alone, that everyone you knew before is distancing themselves from you and you are being \"thrown under the bus.\" The whole objective of this exercise by the Southern District of New York is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation.

    "text": "Okay. Jurors, as you've just heard, the People rested yesterday. The Defense just rested today. So, what normally happens at this point is that you will hear the summations of the attorneys; the summations are then followed by my instructions to you on the law; and then you will begin your deliberations. In a case like this, which is a rather long case, summations will not be quick. I expect that the summations will take, for both attorneys, they will take at least a day. I expect that my instructions will take at least an hour. My belief is that it's always ideal or best not to break up summations. I prefer that the jury hear both summations at the same time, if at all possible. It's not always possible. Also, ideally, I then would like to give the jury the jury charge; and then immediately after the jury charge, I would like for the jury to begin your deliberations. As you know, this week we are only meeting today and Thursday; therefore, there is no way that we could possibly do what needs to be done in any kind of a cohesive manner; it would just be broken up. I considered all of the permutations, the different scheduling options, and at the end of the day, I think that the best thing that we can do is to adjourn now until next Tuesday. At that time, you will hear the summations of the attorneys, and that will probably continue the next day, on Wednesday —— and I am asking you to come in on Wednesday —— and that next day, Wednesday, you will hear my jury charge, and then I will expect that you will begin your deliberations, hopefully, at some point on Wednesday. So, you are familiar with all of the instructions that I have given to you up to this point. You've heard them many times. It might be tempting to think that, you know, now that both sides have rested, you can kind of let up a little bit. But, in fact, these instructions now take on even greater significance. So, I remind you to, please, not to talk either among yourselves or anyone else on anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is in, and I have given you my final instructions on the law, and I have directed you to begin your deliberations. Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return for supplying any information concerning the trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person improperly to influence you or any members of the jury. Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. And do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony. Please do not read, view or listen to any accounts or discussions of the case, that includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial, or the reading of any posts on any court sites. Do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. Please do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, email or the internet. And do not Google or otherwise search for any information about the case, or the law which applies to the case, or the people involved in the case. Just speaking ahead to next Tuesday, I'm not a hundred percent sure that we're going to get both summations done by 4:30. So, what I would ask you to do between now and then is to give some thought, if necessary, if you could work late on Tuesday. If you are unable to do so, that's fine; we will just continue on Wednesday. All right. Thank you. I will see you in a week."

You may both want to just initial whatever you give her to make sure that it's accurate. First, I would like to go over what it is that I received from you, just to make sure that I have everything. I received an email from Mr. Colangelo, dated May 13th, at 8:34 AM, with the proposed attachments. I received an email with attachments from Mr. Bove May 14th, at 9:09 AM. I then received another email from Mr. Colangelo on May 15th, at 5:37 PM. That was regarding the proposal structure as to the remaining counts. I received an email from Mr. Colangelo on May 17th, at 10:22 AM. That was the People's response to the Defense proposal. Those were the substantive emails that I received. Today, I also received four joint submissions. I'm not sure what time the first two came in. But, one of them, the first one, had to do with —— the first one had to do with the proposal structure on FECA. The second one had to do with the proposal on accomplice as a matter of law. The third one was a joint submission regarding falsifying business records in the first degree and several other charges. Then, the last one was a joint submission regarding Election Law Section 17—152 predicate. Is there anything that you believe that you submitted that I have not acknowledged?"

    "text": "Yes, your Honor. Our position on FECA, here, because of the way its positioned in the Government's theory of the case, meaning no longer a predicate on the business records count but now an unlawful activity as an object of the New York Election Law conspiracy, that the FECA predicate in that position, it has to be a criminal FECA violation. Because a conspiracy to violate New York Election Law, it's only a crime if it has a criminal object. If it's a non—criminal violation, you're talking, I submit, about a civil conspiracy, at most. This is an issue, both, at the FECA level and then when we talk about that one predicate charge that's very, very important to us, which is New York Business Law 175.10 requires intent to either commit or conceal another crime. That other crime, now we know, is New York Election Law. But, there's no illegal conspiracy. That's the key. It's got to be an illegal conspiracy, unless the conspiracy's object, one of them, is criminal. So, it's not enough for the Government to establish a civil violation of FECA or to suggest to the jury that —— I understand that they don't have to prove a substantive violation of FECA —— but to suggest that the object conspiracy was a civil violation of FECA. Because what we're talking about is a civil conspiracy, which can't serve as a predicate for the business records charges. If 1 can cite some cases on the conspiracy to the crime has to have a criminal object: People v. Wisan, W—I—S—A—N. This is a Richmond County case. It's a little vague in 1986. But, what it says is that the United States Supreme Court has held, time and again, that to be a criminal conspiracy, there must be a criminal object. And one of the Supreme Court cases cited in Wisan is Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391 at 404, 405. What that means to us, Judge, and why we're asking for the \"willfully\" instruction when you talk about FECA is that, otherwise, it would allow the jury to think about the predicate offense and the objects of this predicate offense in civil terms, and put President Trump in a position where this jury could convict him based on a flawed finding of some kind of intent to conceal a civil conspiracy can elevate a civil misdemeanor charge up to a felony. That's a very serious concern for us. That's why, starting with the FECA charge, we requested your Honor instruct the jury in terms of criminal offenses. And, here, the FECA offense requires a \"willful\" mens rea. That's consistent, Judge —— last one —— with the way that the Government has requested instructions on the Federal tax predicate that they're seeking instructions on. If you look at Page 6 of the Government's request, they ask for a \"willfully\" instruction with respect to that charge. So, I think it's also consistent with their request. But, even if they hadn't made that request, it’s critical for —— to make sure that the jury knows and is required to find that the predicate of the 175.10 charge is a criminal offense, and if the object isn't criminal, then we're stuck with a civil conspiracy."

And that's what they're seeking to do. That's at the core here with respect to \"willfully\" down at the FECA predicate. But, again, when we start talking about New York Election Law, that's extremely problematic. And another reason that it is —— both sides have relied on the CJI instructions, the conspiracy in the sixth degree instruction that we relied upon, I think, is pretty clear that: \"The Defendant must intend\" —— I'm quoting —— \"conduct constituting a crime be performed.\" So, I think the Supreme Court has been clear that for a conspiracy to be criminal, it must have a criminal object, and I think the New York Pattern Instructions recognize that.

There's two other points I would make in quick response. One —— to what Mr. Bove just said. One is that, more broadly, your Honor, and as you previewed yesterday, and as you may have seen from our proposed FECA charge, we think there's value, as you indicated, in tailoring the \"unlawful means\" instructions more narrowly and more concisely than in our original proposal. One of the reasons for that, as the Court held in denying the Defendant's Omnibus Motions to dismiss, the falsifying business records offense is committed when the Defendant has the intent to defraud, that includes the intent to commit or aid or conceal in the commission of another crime. But, the object crime doesn't need to be completed, and there are cases the Court has cited where the Defendant was acquitted of the object crime. So, because we're now talking about —— and one element of the predicate of the charged offense —— we think it makes more sense for the Court not to burden the jury with excessive verbiage we don't think is necessary for the jury to accept what's necessary here."

So, it's the proposed importation of a different test from an entirely different context. Even the case he cited, the Fourth Circuit case, North Carolina Right to Life v. Leake, L—E—A—K—E, we believe has been either overruled or substantially aggregated by a subsequent Fourth Circuit decision, Real Truth Against Abortion, 681 F.3d 544. It's not even clear at all this is a viable test in the limited context in the Regulations on expressive advocacy. In any event, your Honor, it's not necessary to define this term for a couple of other reasons. One. As we discussed, we think the jury needs less, not more, on FECA instructions; and we think the term \"for the purpose of influencing any election\" is a pretty straight—forward term that jurors can understand. Second. We think to the extent the Court defines the \"irrespective of the candidacy\" test, which we're going to talk about, that test is going to be the test for determining whether an individual third—party's payments of a candidate's personal expenses, whether that's a contribution or not.

First, the \"irrespective of the candidacy\" and the way the language appears in the Regulation is not, on its face, the most artful turn of phrase, and we thought it might be a useful explanation for the jury, to help them understand: What does it mean for a third—party's payment of a personal candidate's personal expenses to be done irrespective of the candidacy? And this gloss that we've identified in this additional sentence is language directly from an FEC advisory opinion, which is a binding and definitive interpretation of FECA issued by the Commission and that the Commission has looked to define when something is \"irrespective of a candidate\". That's the first reason. The second reason is that there's been factual testimony —— and we anticipate this will be a contested point on summations —— regarding what the different motivations were for executing the Karen McDougal payment and the Stormy Daniels payment.

Mr. Bove has opposed the sentence highlighted in yellow in that it suggests a subjective test. That is a motion we briefed at the Motion in Limine stage, and we gave the Court two pages of authority for looking at whether a payment would have been made irrespective of a candidacy is a subjective test. That's how you determine whether a payment would be made irrespective of the candidacy or not. You have to look at the reasons. And these authorities are cited in our Opposition to the Defendant's Motions in Limine at Page 13 to 14. That's a document we filed on February 29th. We think the \"it's subjective\" evaluation is the way that Regulation is applied. So, for that reason, we think the sentence that the People proposed is the better explanation of the \"irrespective\" test than the final sentence in that paragraph that the Defense proposed. If the Court is inclined to go with the final sentence in the Defense paragraph, we do think it would need to refer to a third—party's payment, because those are the circumstances we're talking about here; and that sentence does not, right now, refer to if a third party would have made the payment."

First, we think, again, \"normal and legitimate press function\", especially against the facts that have already been elicited during this trial, is a concept that the jury will be likely to understand without unnecessary additional instruction and that the parties can argue on summations. We're not sure any further explanation of that term is necessary. If it is, the problem with the last sentence here —— which we acknowledge is drawn from the fact—pattern in one of the cases cited in the footnote. The problem with that last sentence is a little bit confusing because it has nothing to do with the circumstances of this case. \"Sending solicitation letters\", \"seeking new subscribers\", it's hard to see how that explains to the jury what a normal, legitimate press function is. If we're going to be giving examples, it seems odd to select that one over other ones, including, for example, the FEC's exception when it came to the FEC involvement in the facts of this case. PEG involvement was not a function of its limited activity, but, instead, fell outside that for four reasons. We outlined those four factors in the proposal we sent to the Court last week. We stripped it out, following the Court's guidance yesterday, to be a little more concise. If the Court is inclined to include an exception, we think it should be something closer to the facts of the case that the jury is likely to understand and not a confusing and attenuated example about solicitation records that were referenced in a District Court case from 1981."

In terms of AMI's Conciliatory Agreement, we don't think that represents a \"legitimate press function\" for this case, that the press exception didn't apply. There's evidence in the record that AMI wanted to resolve these things and move on. You remember Mr. Pecker's testimony. There was a large transaction in escrow. They wanted to resolve their business and close, so they could move forward. It applied on the Non—Prosecution Agreement for fact—findings to support what it was doing in that case.

So, in that context, that's a very complicated legal concept. Our position is, a criminal conspiracy, this is 17—152, Election Law Conspiracy between parties, that the Government will make arguments about, it was a private secret agreement. And then President Trump tried to conceal a private secret agreement of others. We think in that context, where the Government's burden requires proof that the President sought to conceal a conspiracy, an in coed agreement, not a substantive crime, that more emphasis on these intent elements is required.

In part, because of how the defense presented the case in opening statement. The defense made extensive arguments in opening —— this is at the transcript Page 893 to 895. Sort of a lengthy discussion of the fact that the defendant did not himself enter the accounting records directly. The Court‘s authority under CPL 300.10 (2) to charge the jury, includes instructing the jury on material legal principles that are important to the case. We think the concept of made or caused, particularly because of how the defense says it, both presented the case in opening and indicating that they intend to argue it in summation, we think that's a critical concept. And the reasonably foreseeable language that we included here is drawn directly from the case law, including the four cases that we cited in footnote that the Court referenced in our proposal. There is no disagreement, we don't understand there to be, that causing false entries occurs when the falsification of those entries is the reasonably foreseeable consequence in this action.

That's number one. Problem number two is made clear by the CJI charge on accessorial liability. There has to be corresponding intent. To tell the jury at this point in the instruction, you can find causation based on reasonable foreseeability, but de—couple that from the intent requirement, would make this completely wrong as a matter of law."

Nobody said he went into the power company's power accumulation system and altered how the billing records were going to coming out, but applying jumper cables supported the conviction. So, on facts like the ones we have here, and given the way the parties have had to argue the case, we think this is a very straightforward explanation of the law that is important for the jury to understand."

This elaborates in ways that are favorable to the Government and not entirely accurate as matter of law on a definition that your Honor seems inclined to let stand on its own based on the CJI charge. There is also, I think, a very significant issue with suggesting —— with instructing the jury that intent to defraud could include defrauding a Government in the voting public based on the facts of this case. We raised it in a footnote to our request. The issue is under Tavares, a Court of Appeals case the Government cites, we're dealing with enhanced intent element to elevate this to a felony, and if the jury is permitted to find that intent to defraud includes intent to defraud the Government, it really leaves nothing for the part of the concealment mens rea because the Government's theory is that involved a conspiracy to defraud the Government in the voting public. So, we think to use this language, you know, we know everybody is trying to put themselves in the best position. We understand what we're doing here, but this is just that. It's their argument. We're not going to be making arguments along these lines. But this instruction would, at a minimum, be confusing, we submit legal error, because it will permit the jury to return a guilty verdict by merging intent to defraud and the other part of the enhancement element."

We briefed it extensively to the Court. The Court ruled. In your Honor's own words, and acknowledging controlling case law, defined \"intent to defraud,\" and in the next section \"intent to commit or conceal another crime.\" So, these two sections, both intent to defraud and intent to commit or conceal another crime, are drawn directly from this Court's existing analysis of those two elements of the offense. And we think under CPL 300.10, this is a perfect example of an instance where the charging obligations should include explaining to the jury how the facts of the case apply to the law, particularly because the circumstances like intent to defraud the Government, or intent to defraud the voting public are germane here. One other point here, your Honor, unlike in the FECA charge, for example, where we agree that it makes a lot of sense for the Court to take a less is more approach because there the Court was considering charging language on an unlawful means element of a predicate offense, these are actual definitional terms in the charged crime. So if there is anywhere that it makes sense to give the jury more guidance, it's in defining terms like intent to defraud and intent to conceal or commit another crime. The Court took a similar approach in the Trump Corporation tax fraud case by defining when the defendants wrongfully took, obtained or withheld money from their owner in order to support larceny charges. And the Court referred to the owner as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. And so, this is an approach the Court adopted in other cases, and we think the additional language here is warranted."

The reasonable doubt charges also says what the People don't have to prove. And then, your Honor, again, particularly where we are going to be going into some detail regarding the contours of the object crime, the intended crime, the predicate, we think it would be particularly confusing for the jury not to be told what they are to make of the instruction they are about to get regarding the Election Law Violation and then regarding the unlawful means to support the Election Law Violation.

    "text": "I think the real dispute between the parties is the wilfully language, from our perspective. From our perspective, for the 17—152 conspiracy to be a criminal conspiracy, there has to be intent that reflects the highest level of intent of the objects of the conspiracy. Here we've had the argument at the beginning about FECA, and our position is that, for this to be a criminal conspiracy at all, it has to be a criminal violation of FECA. Criminal conspiracy has to have a criminal object. But, in addition to that, the Federal tax unlawful means that the Government has proposed, they concede in their request, that that is a statute that requires wilfulness. So, there are two unlawful means proposed by the Government, two categories, at least, FECA and tax crimes, that both have that wilfulness mens rea. And so, our position is that that needs to be imported up into the 17—152 mens rea. That is, the mental state required to join the conspiracy. Our cite, this is in Footnote 25 of our request to charge, People versus Caban, C—A—B—A—N, New York Court of Appeals, 2005. This is an individual who is prosecuted for conspiracy and necessarily is an individual that must have the prescribed mens rea, the requisite intent to join others and commit a substantive crime. So that second sentence from Caban, we submit, is controlling here. So, because the object of the unlawful activity under 17—152 must be criminal —— and we're going to have this argument in a little bit, we don't think that the tax predicate should go to the jury. But, if it does, it will have this wilfully requirement, same with respect to FECA. So, we think when you are describing this Election Law Conspiracy, for you to be describing a crime, a potentially valid predicate to elevate the charges to a felony, it has to have this wilful language."

It violates those or would violate those Criminal Provisions of 26 U.S.C. So, that's not a concession in some cases \"willfulness\" is required. It's not. The underlying criminal conduct violates the criminal prohibitions of FECA anyway, but clearly meets the standard of \"willfulness\". That's not a concession.

Again, the only proof obligation the People have, which is a high one, is to establish that this Defendant had made or caused false entries in the business records of his enterprises, with an intent to defraud and the intent to conceal the commission of another crime.

I think the second key disagreement here is we believe the Court should advise the jury that there are three different unlawful means that the co—conspirators intended to execute in order to promote the Defendant’s election unlawfully: violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act, falsification of other business records, and the violation of Tax Laws. And we understand —— and I believe this is a sufficiency argument. We understand that the Defense opposes that third category, the violation of Tax Laws."

Because if they don't prove up criminal objects, then there is no criminal conspiracy. In that event, there is no predicate to elevate the 175.10 charges up to a felony. So, under these circumstances, the way the Government chose to put this theory of this case to this jury, there does need to be proof. Because, otherwise, the jury could find that there was a conspiracy to promote President Trump's election without unlawful means, in which case, that would not support what the Government is going to ask this jury to do. So, we think that our language is an accurate statement of the law, and proof is required that there were criminal objects of this conspiracy. Because, otherwise, there's no unlawful means. In that event, there's no 17—152 conspiracy, and there's no basis to elevate this up to a felony."

There's a very significant difference between the facts in Mackey and a burglary charge, where the Court of Appeals said there can be evidence of criminal intent of the fact of the entry, the manner in which the burglary happened. This is not that case. And your Honor has discretion here. The really important issue is: The predicate that the Government is moving forward on requires proof of unlawful means. The jury cannot infer that the predicate is established just by the fact that there was an agreement to promote President Trump's election in 2016. Of course there was. He won. They have to establish some kind of unlawful means to make that a crime. That makes this very different from Mackey. That's why we structured these proposals in the way that we did."

As we understand it, the Defense objection to including this charge at all is that I believe the Defense is arguing that the evidence is insufficient to establish Tax Law violations. We just think the trial record refutes any argument along those lines. The record shows, both through witness testimony and the documentary evidence, including Weisselberg's handwritten notes on the Essential Consultants' bank statement at People's Exhibit 35, Jeff McConney's contemporaneous handwritten notes, People's 36, the record shows that part of the intended concealment here was to camouflage the reimbursement as income so it wouldn't be noticed. And in order to camouflage it as income or as a consequence of camouflaging it as income, they doubled it, they grossed it up for tax purposes. Weisselberg and McConney even wrote down \"grossed up\" on People's 35, \"times two for taxes\" on People's 36. So, falsely identifying corporate payment as reimbursement —— as income rather than reimbursement. And then, as the Court also saw through the 1099s that were submitted to the IRS, carrying forward that deception through documents that not only were intended to be, but ultimately were, submitted to Government agencies, all is evidence of false —— submission of false information to Tax Authorities; and those elements, alone, establish the City, State and Federal Tax violations that we identified."

And, to be honest, I didn't even really think about it. I just wanted to get my money back.\" That testimony is the reason that the tax predicate should not go to this jury, because what the Government's theory is, is that they're talking about tax filings by Mr. Cohen. He didn't agree to do anything. There's that 1099 Miscellaneous Form which just only reflects and it confirms in an open way that payments were made to Mr. Cohen. The Trump Organization was transparent about this. That's not evidence of some kind of agreement to make false tax filings by Mr. Cohen. And Mr. Cohen testified that he didn't know anything about it.

The trial record supports it was a reimbursement because it tracks directly the $100,000 to Keith Davidson. Arguably, there's competing evidence the parties can present to the jury. We don't remotely think it's income for work. We think the transcript shows he knew he was getting income for reimbursement that they were calling \"income\" when it's not. He also said over and over again that the checks were reimbursement, they were not payment for a retainer for services rendered. So, all of that supports the view that he knew he was getting money called \"income\" when it wasn't. That, alone, supports the tax violation, Judge."

And so, we broke this out in terms of documents that came in in that fashion on witness testimony. I think that with respect to the documents, we are largely in agreement. And there is a dispute about the witnesses, meaning there was testimony from Hope Hicks and from Mr. Cohen about public reactions and responses to the Access Hollywood tape. Our position is that the only basis for that testimony to come in was not for its truth, but rather for its impact on the listener. Here, I assume the Government's theory is that President Trump necessarily was one of the listeners, and they‘re going to make arguments about how he reacted to these statements that they've elicited. What we are seeking is an instruction that clarifies and confirms that factual assertions in those reactions were not offered for their truth. Things about, for example, the RNC's reaction to the tape and how that might impact their association with President Trump in his campaign at the time. The Government disputes how this evidence came in with respect to Ms. Hicks. And I think we would like to clarify here. Your Honor will recall that there were —— there was a series of questions during Ms. Hick's direct examination about reactions, and at some point —— and we did not object to those, not because we believed they were coming in for the truth, but because sitting here I understood why they were coming in for their impact on the listener. At some point, the questioning, from our perspective, became cumulative in that, as we've said before, in our view there is sort of a tipping point for evidence that's not coming in for its truth becomes unduly prejudicial. When we reached that point, I asked for a sidebar. At sidebar I referenced the hearsay issue. I said I understood that there is a time and place for this type of evidence, and I think we've gone over the threshold. So, I think it's clear on the record that we understood why the evidence was coming in and the instruction that we are asking for on Page 78 just makes that clear to the jury. And we think that's important and we don't think it should be very controversial because there is no other basis for the communications and the testimony that we are referencing this instruction."

There is a suggestion in the Government's reply to our request, that there is some kind of dispute that the jury needs to evaluate about whether —— what that non—pros reflects and whether it reflects a violation. We think that type of argument would be wholly inappropriate in front of the jury, unless somebody opens the door to it. 1 have been clear about our intentions with respect to the door. So there really shouldn't be any argument from the Government in summations about what that non—pros reflects on behalf of AMI, because that would be making arguments about the non—pros as substantive evidence of President Trump‘s guilt. The only reason —— like the FECA pleas, the only reason that the non—pros is in evidence is with respect to Mr. Pecker's credibility. It's not in evidence as substantive proof of anything.

We think that the door was opened by the Government on direct examination of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker by —— through a series of questions about a conversation that Mr. Pecker had with Mr. Cohen relating to the Agreements involved —— that concern Ms. McDougal. And we flagged this issue in advance of the trial, that in the records that were disclosed to us, there was this comment about the agreement being \"bulletproof.\" It is a fair inference from that, the use of that word by Mr. Pecker, that what he meant was that it had been vetted by counsel. He actually testified, I believe on direct, that it had been vetted by counsel. What happened then, Judge, is that Mr. Cohen —— and this was to some extent from us unexpected —— Mr. Cohen confirmed that he communicated that word to President Trump. That was an evidentiary link we hadn't necessarily anticipated at this trial, absent President Trump taking the stand. Once that evidentiary link was made, there is a fair inference that he —— he understood that to mean that it had been vetted by counsel, that the Agreement was legal. Why does that matter at this trial? We haven't put on a formal advice of counsel defense. I'm not seeking to retread that. What we are seeking to do, though, Judge, is to argue that this is extremely probative of President Trump's intent and, in particular, whether or not the Government can meet their burden of establishing intent to defraud, and the other types of intent that we talked about today, willfulness as to FECA, et cetera. And so, the fair inference from this conversation that‘s in evidence, supports us, and supports this instruction, and at a minimum, even if the Court is not going to give the instruction, this is an argument that we wanted to raise at this conference and flag because we do think it‘s appropriate, both with respect to the bulletproof comment and the inferences that President Trump drew from it, and from the general fact that this entire trial is entirely predicated on the testimony of an attorney who worked for President Trump and that he was entitled to draw some inferences from that fact. The Government seeks competing inferences. They seek to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. We understand that. But our position is that this is an exceedingly fair argument for the Defense to make when we challenge the Government's burden, even if the Court is not going to give the instruction we have requested."

    "text": "Your Honor, this is a retread. Your Honor rejected this argument on March 18th in your Order granting the People's motion in limine to exclude any argument regarding reliance on advice of counsel. To the extent that Mr. Bove is making an opening—the—door argument, this defense and any argument based on this defense is both legally and factually unavailable for a number of reasons. The first is that under New York Law, a prerequisite for making any argument like this is that the defendant himself testifies in order to establish a prima facie case of his state of mind. The defendant exercised his constitutional right not to testify and subject himself to cross—examination. But having done so, having done so, he can't then seek to introduce argument or present argument to the jury regarding his intent. And the New York Law that I'm referring to, there is a case called People versus Lurie, L—U—R—I—E, 249 AD 2d 119. That's a First Department case. So, legally unavailable because the defendant didn‘t establish the basis for this claim himself anyway. The second, as the Court already recognized, and again as a legal matter, the presence of counsel concept, particularly when it's based on some claim of reliance regarding what a third party's lawyer may have said, is also legally unavailable. And we cited a case here in Court called Lek Securities Corporation 2019 West Law 573944. That's a Southern District of New York case from 2019. That case held that a defendant can't assert a reasonable or good faith reliance based on a third party’s representation of advice to third party received through consultations with counsel to which the defendant himself did not have access. And then, there is a factual reason why that particular analysis applies with strong force in this case, which is that the testimony also shows that Mr. Pecker didn‘t give even remotely close to a full presentation of the facts to the lawyer that he consulted. He, in fact, testified that he specifically authorized his General Counsel to give to the outside lawyer simply the McDougal contract and didn't advise the lawyer of any of the underlying facts that would be necessary to determine whether the contract did or didn't evidence of violation of Campaign Finance Law. He didn't tell him about the agreement in Trump Tower. He didn't tell him that his real purpose was to influence the election. He didn't tell him that he didn't value the services that McDougal was going to provide at 150 grand. He only valued it at 25 grand. He didn't give him —— he didn't tell him about the intended assignment of the life rights back to Mr. Trump after the fact. So, none of the facts that an attorney would have needed to rely on in order to make an informed judgment about the lawfulness of that contract were even presented to the attorney, which is why a defendant can't rely on third party advice for this kind of defense in the first place."

In that decision, I directed the Defense to provide Notice of Disclosure of your intent to rely on the defense of advice of counsel by March 11th, 2024, and to produce all discoverable statements and communications within his possession or control by the same date. Subsequently, in response —— and the answer was we're not relying on advice of counsel, therefore, there is no waiver; there is no need to submit any documents. Later on, the defense of advice of counsel morphed into something called the presence of counsel, which I had never heard of and I was not familiar with, but I addressed it in the motions in limine.

The Government's response is that there was some testimony that there was a subsequent backup or syncing of the phones. But there is testimony —— Mr. Daus was unable to testify and could not testify, because he wasn't able to do the analysis about what that —— what was actually loaded back onto the phone. So, we think for that reason, the exfoliation instruction is appropriate. In addition, there was testimony from Mr. Daus about the use of the apps like Signal and Dust and Telegram that sent messages to quote, \"explode\" or \"self—delete.\" I'm referring to the transcript at Page 2058.

That the sync came from a laptop with a user name from Michael Cohen, and that he was unable to verify in any way what was loaded back onto the phone because he never had access to the laptop. Not at all what Mr. Steinglass just said about a complete backup. And our argument is not that the evidence was deleted for the purposes of this instruction, the factual basis is not that evidence was deleted in 2020 when he reset it again or in 2023 when it was mishandled, the inference is in 2016 when he did the reset, and he loaded something else that we don't know about onto the phone. In addition, the use of the apps that involve self—exploding messages and the deletion of messages that he concededly sent in 2016 also supports the instruction."

In fact, the Government's witnesses were testifying correctly. And this is also a situation, Judge, there has been several times today where we've said we are not going to have instructions that sort of credit or put weight on other arguments. This is the Government seeking to have weight put on their argument about whether a Retainer Agreement is required. Those authorities establish that that's not the case.

But they cite to the New York City Code of Rules and Regulations, and they acknowledge the existence of the rule that requires them. This is not about whether or not there is a dispute over legal fees between the parties. This is about whether it was correct for the Defense to ask questions of the witnesses to imply —— not to imply, to outright state, that there is no requirement for a written Retainer Agreement. And there is. And the theoretical exception that Mr. Bove points to in 1215.2 sub B is not applicable here because even Mr. Cohen testified that he did maybe ten hours of legal work for Mr. Trump and his family in the entire year of 2017. So, to say that 1215.2 sub B, which is an exception to the rule requiring a Retainer Agreement when the attorney services are of the same general described as previously rendered to and paid for by the client as though that somehow covers what Mr. Cohen was doing for the Trump Organization for the ten years before when he was on salary, is, I think, I don't want to say disingenuous because that's a pejorative, but not appropriate and does not cure the fact that they have misled the jury."

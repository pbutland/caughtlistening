    "text": "Good morning, jurors. Welcome back. Members of the jury, we will now hear the summations of the lawyers. Following their summations, I will instruct you on the law and then you will begin your deliberations. Under our law, Defense Counsel must sum up first and the Prosecutor must follow. The lawyers may not speak to you after that. Summations provide each lawyer an opportunity to review the evidence and submit for your consideration the facts, inferences and conclusions that they contend may properly be drawn from the evidence. If you find that a lawyer has accurately summarized and analyzed the evidence, and if you find that the inferences and conclusions the lawyer asks you to draw from that evidence are reasonable, logical and consistent with the evidence, then you may adopt those inferences and conclusions. Members of the jury, please bear in mind the following points: First, you are the finders of fact. And it is for you and you alone to determine the facts from the evidence that you find to be truthful and accurate. Thus, you should remember that whatever the lawyers say and however they say it, it is simply arguments submitted for your consideration. Second, remember, the lawyers are not witnesses in this case. So if the lawyers assert as fact something that's not based on the evidence, you must disregard it. Remember, nothing the lawyers say at any time is evidence, so nothing the lawyers say in their summations is evidence. You have heard the evidence. And you must decide this case on the evidence as you find it and the law as I explain it. Third, during the summations, one lawyer's recollection of the evidence may in good faith differ from the recollection of the other lawyer or from your own recollection. And the lawyers will undoubtedly differ with each other on the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence. It is your own recollection, understanding, and evaluation of the evidence, however, that controls, regardless of what the lawyers have said or will say about the evidence. Again, you and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case. If, during your deliberations, you need to have your recollection of the testimony refreshed, you may have all or any portion of the testimony read back to you. Fourth, remember, under our law, I am responsible for explaining the law, not the lawyers. If you think there is any difference between what the lawyers may have said and what I say the law is, your sworn duty as jurors is to follow my instructions on the law, as you have promised me that you would. And, fifth, if during the summations I sustain an objection to a comment of a lawyer, that comment will be stricken from the record and you must disregard it as if it were never said. If I overrule an objection, the comment will stand. Whether I sustain or overrule an objection, or on my own indicate that a comment must be disregarded, my ruling indicates only that the comment does or does not violate one of the rules of law set down for lawyers to follow during their summation. It is not an intent to indicate that I have an opinion on what is said or of the facts of the case, or whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. Remember, under our law, you, the jury, judge the facts, if any, to determine which facts, if any, have been proven and whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, not I and not the lawyers. Jurors, at this time, it's not clear whether we will be able to complete both sets of summations by 4:30. I leave it to you to decide whether you would like to work beyond 4:30 so that we can finish the second summation. Expect that if we do need to work beyond that time, it won't be very long, perhaps an hour. But I leave it to you. You discuss it. You decide. And you let me know what you would like to do. If you decide that you don't want to work late today, we will just finish it up tomorrow morning. Having said that, we will now commence summations. Counsel."

    "text": "Thank you, your Honor. I'm sorry, I am just confirming something. All right. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I hope that everybody had a nice, long weekend. I want to start with something that I can say, I think with confidence, that everybody inside this well agrees with, which is just to thank you -- to thank you for your jury service. You guys, every one of you, have been here on time and we see you paying close attention to the evidence all day, every day, and we really appreciate that. Our Criminal Justice System, as Judge Merchan just told you, is unique. There is not a lot of justice systems in the world like ours where a group of citizens like you all actually decide the facts. It's not the Prosecution. It's not the Judge. It's not a group of judges. It's you all that decide the facts. And each of you will decide, at the end of this case, whether President Trump is guilty or not guilty. And when I stood here five weeks ago, five weeks ago, on April 22nd, I started out by saying something that I'm going to repeat to you right now because it's as true right now as it was on April 22nd, and that is, that President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes. And the District Attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period. The evidence is all in. It all came in as of last Tuesday. And that evidence, like I said to you on April 22nd, should leave you wanting more. You should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen. You should want and expect more than Deb Tarasoff telling us how she booked certain invoices and how she vouchered certain evidence on the personal records of President Trump; something beyond the word of a woman who claims that something happened in 2006. You should demand more than the testimony of Keith Davidson, an attorney who really was just trying to extort money from President Trump in the lead up to the 2016 election. And there are consequences, the consequences of the utter lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple:  It's a not guilty verdict. Period. Now, this morning we are going to -- I'm going to spend some time talking to you about the evidence that you all saw over the past five weeks. But it is also not just about what you saw and what you heard in this courtroom, but also what you didn't hear. This case -- this case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago; an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred. It's not even about a confidential settlement in 2016 and a Non-disclosure Agreement with Stormy Daniels that was signed nearly eight years ago. It goes to the charges, the reason why we're here, the reason why you all are here, is whether and to what extent President Trump, while he was living in the White House, as the leader of the free world, whether he had anything to do with how payments to Michael Cohen, his Personal Attorney at the time, were booked on his personal account and ledger at Trump Tower. Is the booking of legal expenses on the personal ledger of President Trump accurate?  Were the -- were those bookings done with an intent to defraud? That's why you are here. And the answer to that, to those questions are absolutely, positively, not. The bookings were accurate, and there was absolutely no intent to defraud. And, beyond that, there was no conspiracy -- no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by President Trump, the folks at AMI, Michael Cohen. The proof there doesn't add up, and we are going to talk about that this morning. Let's talk about the evidence. I'm going to try to use a pointer, and if I fail, then Mr. Sitko will stand in for us."

    "text": "This is what I was just talking about. These are the charges that you ultimately have to find. And as Judge Merchan just told you, I'm not going to talk about the law, that's the Judge's job. But if I do say anything about the law, if Judge Merchan says something different, his word controls, of course. The bottom line is, the charges in this case have to do with invoices, vouchers, and checks. The invoices were all submitted by Michael Cohen. And I'm going to stop -- you are going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen today; that should not surprise you. You cannot convict President Trump -- you cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen. There were key conversations, key interactions that he claimed that he had with Dylan Howard, with Keith Schiller, Allen Weisselberg; those are important. But Keith Schiller, Dylan Howard, and Allen Weisselberg were not witnesses in this trial. Michael Cohen is the witness that they called. And the words that Michael Cohen said to you on that stand, they matter. They matter. He took an oath. He swore to tell the truth. And he told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies. Pure and simple. Now, the records that we are talking about here that are on the screen, those are not, as you all know, they are not 2015 records, they are not 2016 records, these are all records that were generated by folks in 2017 when President Trump was in the White House. You heard that when he was there, he was working from early in the morning until late at night, as you would expect. And the checks that he signed, which we are going to talk about, he signed when he was at the White House. Now, there are two things that I expect that you won't find as it relates to these documents. First, is that the documents contained false entries; and, second, that President Trump acted with an intent to defraud. Those are not the only two elements that are at issue in this case, but those are the elements that are an issue with the documents. And I am going to start with these two because in some ways you don't have to go further. The records are not false, and there was no intent to defraud. So let's talk about the invoices. These invoices, as you all know and remember, were prepared and sent by Michael Cohen and then the accounting staff at Trump Tower just put the stamp, the stamp on them, as you see on the screen there. Then there were vouchers. And the vouchers, as you know, were prepared by Ms. Tarasoff, who testified. She told you that she and Jeff McConney used a system called MDS. Do you remember that Monday when both of them testified and they talked about the accounting software that The Trump Organization used called \"MDS.\" And the vouchers, the information that was put in those vouchers were a result of what the invoices said; right. Do you remember she told you that? That she saw the invoice from Mr. Cohen, and based upon what she saw in that invoice, that's exactly how she knew what to put on the voucher. It also was consistent with what she understood was happening at that time, which is that Michael Cohen was serving as President Trump's Personal Attorney, which was true. There is not even a dispute about that. And then -- and then the checks; right. So the checks are on the far side of the screen that you are looking at in front of you or higher up. The information on these checks was also auto generated from the information put into the vouchers; that's what Ms. Tarasoff told you. And so, again, the language in the check documentation is all driven by the vouchers, which is all driven by the invoices. So, let's talk first about the invoices. Now, some of these invoices were sent in the body of emails; some were sent as attachments to emails; and you can see examples of both of them here. Every single one was addressed to Allen Weisselberg, care of President Trump. There is no dispute that not a single invoice was emailed or sent to President Trump directly. Now, I expect the Government will say, well, you know that President Trump saw these invoices because, generally speaking, Ms. Tarasoff told you that it was her practice to staple them to the back of checks before they were sent to President Trump. And she explained how that process worked. But -- and, again, through no fault of her own, because we're talking about something that happened in 2017, she did not have any specific recollection of whether the invoices that relate to the particular charges in this case were actually stapled to the checks. She told you about her general practice. But general practice, ladies and gentlemen, is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Especially when Ms. Tarasoff told you that she never did anything at the direction of President Trump. She never spoke to President Trump about anything to do with the checks or invoices. She just did what she always does. She got an invoice from a lawyer, and entered the invoice as a legal expense. Now, the second point I want to make about these invoices is that Cohen typically wrote \"for services rendered;\" right. But here is the thing -- and I don't think there is even a dispute about this -- Cohen was rendering services to President Trump in 2017, as his Personal Attorney. He admitted that. He said it on direct examination. He said it on cross-examination. There is really no question that in 2017 Michael Cohen was serving as President Trump's Personal Attorney. As a matter of fact, on direct examination, as you can see on the screen, he said, one of the reasons why he needed to serve as President Trump's Personal Attorney was because there were still outstanding matters that they were dealing with, which was true. There were outstanding matters that Mr. Cohen was dealing with on behalf of President Trump in 2017. Here is just one example, and there are others. This is a May 2017 email from Mr. Cohen to Mr. Weisselberg: \"Hope all is well. Please find attached the May invoice. And call me to discuss the last open foundation matter.\" That's in May of 2017. Now, the Government wants you to believe that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Weisselberg and President Trump had some kind of agreement, some kind of conspiratorial agreement to falsify the records; that Mr. Cohen was really not working for the $35,000. He was working for free. That's what they have said to you. But, here, as you can see, Mr. Cohen is sharing with Mr. Weisselberg an invoice and saying \"call me\" or \"I need to discuss something I'm doing on behalf of President Trump.\" Here is another example. There was some litigation related matter, as you may recall, from someone named Summer Zervos. Now -- and, again, this happened a lot. But Cohen lied to you -- Cohen lied to you on direct examination when he said, in response to the question:  \"How would you characterize the amount of work that you did generally on that matter, if any?\" \"Very minimal.\" But then on cross when he was confronted with documents, he indicated that he was lead counsel, co-lead counsel on that matter. And in response to a question about whether that was taking a fair amount of his time to work on that, Mr. Cohen said, \"Yes.\" And that's just two examples of what Mr. Cohen was doing for President Trump in 2017. He tried to call it minimal. It wasn't. But even if it was minimal, even if the amount of work that Mr. Cohen was doing for President Trump in 2017 was minimal, there was a Retainer Agreement. And that's how Retainer Agreements work. You heard that. You heard that from Mr. Cohen when he talked about all of the other consulting Retainer Agreements that he had. Do you remember he told you about one with Novartis? Novartis paid him $100,000 a month for 12 months, that's $1.2 million. And he told you he had six interactions with them. Anything criminal about that?  No. That's the way Retainer Agreements work. You are on call. Just like Michael Cohen was on call with President Trump. Now, when the Government talks to you about these invoices by Mr. Cohen, as I expect they will later today, and uses the phrase, \"For Services Rendered,\" what you see on the screen, that's a true statement, period. And that's -- that's not evidence of some secret agreement that Mr. Cohen had with President Trump. He broadcast this fact to the world. Remember, he told you that after he had a meeting and it was established that he would be the Personal Attorney to President Trump, he rolled right into Sean Hannity. He talked to every reporter that he could, pushing the fact that he was going to be the Personal Attorney to Mr. Trump. He put that signature block on every single email that he sent in 2017. This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's Personal Attorney. Period. Now, I talked a little bit about the Retainer Agreement a minute ago. But many of the invoices also talk about Retainer Agreements. Now, remember what Mr. Cohen said to you about Retainer Agreements and whether there was going to be or ever expected to be a written Retainer Agreement between him and President Trump. The testimony is on the stand -- I mean, excuse me on the screen. \"QUESTION:  Correct me if I'm wrong, there was never an expectation that there would be a Retainer Agreement; right?\" \"ANSWER:  Correct.\" That was a lie. And you cannot just minimize the lie and say, well, maybe he made a mistake. A lie is a lie. And this is a significant lie. Remember the email, B206. He was not shown that email on direct examination. This is an email sent by Mr. Weisselberg to Mr. Cohen as soon as he started as President Trump's Personal Attorney. And what does it say?  \"Thank you. You never stopped in for a Bro hug. Please prepare the Agreement we discussed so that we can pay you monthly.\" How can it be that Mr. Cohen repeatedly asserted on direct, on direct examination, and even on cross, there was never going to be a Retainer Agreement. Now, it was a big -- it was a big scam to cover up a pay back. Did they forget to tell Mr. Weisselberg about the scam? I mean, is that what Mr. Cohen wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Now, the invoices continue to talk about Retainer Agreements. And, remember, Mr. Weisselberg was clear, he asked for a Retainer Agreement, asked for him to see it. You didn't see a Retainer Agreement. There is no evidence that there ever was one put together. But, as you know, as you heard from multiple witnesses about that, it doesn't matter."

    "text": "Beyond Mr. Davidson, remember Mr. McConney, who is not a lawyer. He just works for the Trump Organization. He told you the same thing regarding Retainer Agreements and verbal Retainer Agreements. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, there is no dispute that in 2017 there was an attorney-client relationship between Mr. Cohen and President Trump. Nobody has told you differently. He, meaning Mr. Cohen, was President Trump's personal lawyer. Period. So, before we get to the vouchers, let's just take a step back. Nobody disputes that Mr. Cohen was President Trump's personal lawyer in 2017. So what makes more sense? What makes more sense? That President Trump was paying his Personal Attorney in 2017 $35,000 a month pursuant to an Agreement that he made, that President Trump made with his Personal Attorney, right before he took Office. It makes perfect sense. Or the version that Mr. Cohen came in here and told you?  Which is that, no, no, no, no, no, I was not paid, I was going to work for free. Now, I didn't tell anybody that, but in the back of my head, what I thought is I will just work for free and make a lot of money as a consultant and the $35,000 a month is not really for my retainer fee, it's actually an overpayment for the hundred and thirty thousand dollars that President Trump was paying me back because of the NDA. For the first time in President Trump's life, he decided to pay me back triple. He doubled up the 130. He gave me 50,000 for some online poll that he had decided he wasn't going to pay for for over a year, which, by the way, I stole from him a little bit on that, and decided I wanted a bigger bonus, so I got an extra 60 grand on the bonus. That's not what really happened, ladies and gentlemen. There is a reason why -- there is a reason why in life, usually the simplest answer is the right one -- and that's certainly the case here -- that the story that Mr. Cohen told you on that witness stand, is not true. That, really, he was paid $35,000 a month by President Trump to be his attorney in 2017. Now, next, let's talk about the vouchers. There are 12 of them, as you know. There are 12 vouchers that are at issue in this case. In this case, I put one of them up on the screen for you to see, to remind you. And, again, this is from The Trump Organization's MDS system as you heard about from Mr. McConney and Ms. Tarasoff. Remember, Mr. McConney told you that it was an antiquated accounting system back in 2017. But, also, and significantly, there is no evidence that President Trump knew anything about this voucher system. No evidence. Not a single word. Now, I don't know how the Government is going to address that. But let me tell you this, if the Government reads to you quotes from a book a decade earlier, sometimes more than a decade earlier, you should be suspicious. That's a red flag. If the reason the Government is going to ask you to conclude that President Trump knew anything about this voucher system is because of something that he wrote in a book, where he was assisted by ghost writers, decades earlier, there is a problem in the proof. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not include a passage in a book from decades earlier, ladies and gentlemen. So, you heard also from Ms. Tarasoff about how she decided how to put information in the vouchers. And she told you, remember, this is an email that was sent on Valentine's Day 2017 where Mr. McConney told Deb:  \"Pay this from The Trust, post to legal expenses and put retainer on the months of January and February, 2017.\" Very clear instructions. And it's exactly what Ms. Tarasoff did. But, I just read the whole email, there are three separate sentences. Each of these sentences should give you, without a doubt, reasonable doubt. We already talked about the retainer, the retainer issue. You can see that -- and you saw this in the records on the voucher -- that what Ms. Tarasoff was told to do is exactly what she did; she followed Mr. McConney's instructions. She didn't follow President Trump's instructions. She didn't follow Allen Weisselberg's instructions. She followed Mr. McConney's instructions. Now, she booked it as a legal expense, which, by the way, as both she and Mr. McConney told you, every single invoice that came to The Trump Organization, whether President Trump's personal accounts or elsewhere that came from a lawyer or a law firm, was booked the same way, as a legal expense. So, back to that email. There is no other way to categorize an invoice from a lawyer to President Trump than to call it a legal expense. The Government has criminalized that, has said that that was a crime, what Ms. Tarasoff did. That's absurd. It's not a crime. This is what Mr. McConney said about that, payments to the Trump lawyers by The Trump Organization are legal expenses. That's why you booked them that way on the General Ledger. Yes. That's how they were booked. And you can see that, again, on the voucher that I'm displaying, on the pull out. Same thing from McConney, confirming what I said a moment ago, that there is basically just a drop down menu. This isn't Ms. Tarasoff creating some long explanation for how somebody should be -- how an expense or an invoice should be categorized in the system, it's a drop down menu and it's called \"legal expense.\" Now, you heard from Mr. McConney the reason why this was done. Remember -- and the transcript is on the screen now -- the purpose was basically to make payments to attorneys so that they could be reviewed at the end of the year; right?  Correct. And that's exactly what they did. That's not the story. That's not the explanation the Government gave you in opening, when they said this was some elaborate way to cover up a hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment. That's not what the evidence showed. So back to the same email. Now we are at the first sentence:  \"Please pay from The Trust.\" Now, let's first stop for a minute on this. This is a couple of weeks after President Trump had been inaugurated; right. It's February 17th, 2017. He moved to Washington, D.C., and at that time, as you heard, all of President Trump's assets were moved into a Trust. The purpose of this was to avoid any conflict of interest. And, remember, that that Trust went into effect January 20th, the day that President Trump was sworn into Office, and as there was testimony about that from more than one witness. This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization. There were adjustments that were being made. Not a surprise. And, exactly, so, why does that matter? Well, it matters because, as Mr. McConney said, initially they wanted to pay Mr. Cohen out of The Trust. There was some flux and chaos at the time because President Trump had just, for the first time in decades, not been the person running The Trump Organization. So, let's look at that same email, a little bit further down. \"OK to pay as per agreement with Don and Eric.\" Now, who are Don and Eric?  You all know who they are, they are President Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. They were two of the three people that were running the company, right, while President Trump was in Office. If their -- this is one of the charged documents that President Trump is charged with a felony, okay. If there was some sort of conspiratorial agreement, as the People have suggested, between President Trump to Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Weisselberg, if there was actually an Agreement between the three of them to pay Michael Cohen as a cover up, this email does not exist. There is no reason to go and get approval from Don and Eric, if it's already been decided that we are going to pay Mr. Cohen 35,000 a month; don't tell anybody, because it's not really for legal expenses, it's actually just a payback from the $130,000 NDA, then why does this email exist?  Then why do Don and Eric have to approve anything? So, you know, and I don't have an answer to why this -- why the People, notwithstanding this email, tell you that there is a conspiracy that exists. But guess who else you did not hear from in this trial?  Don or Eric. Is there some allegation that they are a part of this scheme, that they are a part of the conspiracy? Now, there is not even a tiny little bit of evidence that suggests that, ladies and gentlemen. That is reasonable doubt. We have no burden to do anything. The burden is always on the Government. They make decisions about who to call at this trial. They called Cohen. They did not call Don and Eric. So, remember what Mr. McConney told you after the first couple of payments were made, after the first three payments were made from The Trust, somebody realized, do you know what, Mr. Cohen is the Personal Attorney to President Trump, The Trust shouldn't be paying that, President Trump should be paying that out of his own personal account. And that's what they did. They recognized that, as they settled in, that because it was a Personal Attorney to the President, that it didn't make sense for the Trump Organization, for The Trust to pay it. They made a mistake the first three months and they fixed it. And, again, that's not evidence of some scheme or intent to defraud, that's just what happens. And it shouldn't surprise you. And so, we can talk about the checks as well while we are on it. Now, there are 11 checks, right, because the first check was for 70 -- was for two months, was for $70,000. Exhibit 4, which is what you see on the screen, it's a $70,000 check relating to the months of January and February, and the second one, People's Exhibit 7, is a $35,000 check relating to March. You know that both of these checks were approved by Eric and Don Jr. And President Trump had nothing to do with them. There is no evidence he had anything to do with anything involving either of these checks. They are signed by Eric. They are signed by Eric Trump and Mr. Weisselberg. Not by President Trump. But, as you know, President Trump signed the remaining checks at the beginning of April 2017. There is an example on the screen to remind you of what they looked like. Now, these checks don't have any of the language, you will see, from the invoice Mr. Cohen sent. They just say retainer. And as you remember from Mr. McConney and Ms. Tarasoff, that was just a generated word from what was put into the voucher. There is nothing sinister or criminal about that word. It's just generated when the check is printed after that information is put in the voucher, not by President Trump, not by Allen Weisselberg, by Deb Tarasoff. So, you shouldn't think that the word \"retainer\" specifies or differentiates between any reason for the payment. It's just a single word. It's just a word that, again, was generated by the MDS system. Now, there was a lot of evidence and in openings there was a lot of talk about how President Trump signed all of these checks beginning in April of 2017. Now, as you heard, from two witnesses, President Trump was very busy. He was running the country. It shouldn't be a surprise about that. And, one of the witnesses, Ms. Westerhout, told you that what she remembers is that sometimes President Trump would look at the checks and the invoices; sometimes he would not. And, again, that isn't surprising. She testified that sometimes there were a lot of checks, a half inch of personal checks because, remember, nobody had the signatory authority on President Trump's personal account except for President Trump. So, when there were checks that had to be signed, only he could do it. So you can't -- you can't convict President Trump because sometimes, without any -- without anything specific at all to a particular charge in this case, President Trump looked at invoices, that somehow he had full knowledge of what was happening. There is -- there is no -- that is a stretch. That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen. Same thing with respect to the Federal Express -- you heard about this Federal Express process that was used. Nothing sinister. It was used because it was a quicker way to get information to President Trump. Again, not surprising when he was in the White House. Now, it wasn't even just President Trump that received information that way. Do you remember? You also heard the First Lady got information from Federal Express, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter got it the same way. So the fact that the checks and the personal information was FedEx'd from Trump Tower to Keith Schiller and then given to President Trump, there is nothing sinister about that. It's common sense when you hear the explanation of why, which you heard from the witnesses."

    "text": "Now, as I just said, it matters where President Trump was during this time. He was constantly moving. He was very busy. He was frequently multitasking. People were constantly interrupting him. He was President of the United States. So, the idea -- the leap that the Government wants you to take that he looked at the checks, looked at the invoices, and was part of the scheme -- and remember what the scheme is: to book a legal expense as a \"legal expense\"; that's the scheme. That he somehow was in on that is absurd. And, again, this is where Ms. Westerhout told you that sometimes he would sign checks even when he was meeting with people, while he was on the phone, and even without reviewing them. Again, nothing surprising there, but it's worth remembering. Now, we're going to talk for just a few minutes now about Mr. Cohen. How is the Government going to ask you to convict President Trump based on the words of Michael Cohen? Even without Mr. Cohen, what we just went through, the Government can't get by with that. The invoices were not generated by anybody at The Trump Organization. They were generated by Michael Cohen. They were sent to The Trump Organization so he could get paid. The fact that the invoices refer to a verbal Retainer Agreement, when you know that there was an attorney-client relationship between President Trump and Michael Cohen in 2017, the fact that the invoices talk about services rendered by Michael Cohen, and you know that he was rendering services during that time in 2017, all that ends the case \"not guilty\". But, there is a lot more. What the People have done, what the Government did for the past five weeks, at the end of the day, is ask you to believe the man who testified two weeks ago, Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen asked you to ignore the documents, ignore what the email says about sending him a Retainer Agreement sent by Mr. Weisselberg, asks you to believe he was just going to work for free. You saw him on the stand for three days, more than three days. Do you believe that for a second? That after getting stiffed on his bonus in 2016, when he thought he had worked so hard and he got stiffed, when he didn't get paid back the 20,000 he was owed, do you think that Mr. Cohen thought: I want to work for free; is that the man who testified, or was that a lie? Now, when we get to Mr. Cohen's testimony, about the issue we're talking about, about the Retainer Agreement, about what he was going to do with it in 2017, just remember something. It's not corroborated by anything. There's not a shred of evidence. What Mr. Cohen told us is that first he talked to Mr. Weisselberg privately, and then they walked down the hall, unscheduled, unannounced, walked into the office of the President-Elect of the United States, who was preparing to be inaugurated just a few days later. And what he wants you to believe, what Mr. Cohen wants you to believe, that he just sat back, Mr. Cohen did, didn't really participate in the conversation. And you can see what he said about it on the screen: \"At some point during this conversation,\" apparently between the President and Allen Weisselberg, \"he turned around and said to me, ummm, while we were talking about this, it was -- and what we're going to do is, we're going to pay you over 12 months.\" He didn't pretend -- Mr. Cohen didn't pretend to be part of the conversation. He said all President Trump said to him is, \"It's going to be one heck of a ride in D.C.\" That's the evidence. That's the evidence and corroboration the Government gave you about President Trump's knowledge in this scheme. Now, this is the same time period, by the way, that President Trump decided to make Mr. Cohen his Personal Attorney. Mr. Cohen told you that. It was around the exact same time. So, Mr. Cohen has two different meetings with President Trump; one when he's told he is going to be the Personal Attorney, and two, when he and Mr. Weisselberg go in and let the President know about this scheme. He wants to you believe that's what gives the President full knowledge -- that's what gives President Trump knowledge of what happens. That's a ridiculous story, and I want to tell you why. I mentioned it earlier. But, the idea that President Trump would agree to pay Michael Cohen $420,000, even though he only owed him 130 is absurd. Cohen even tells you, he told you that he saw Allen Weisselberg hand that piece of paper, which we're going to talk about in a minute, to President Trump for President Trump to look at. So, he wants to you believe that President Trump saw this piece of paper where there's 130,000; 50,000 for Red Finch -- which you know from testimony President Trump said, \"I'm not paying that.\" But, out of the blue, he decides: You know what, not only am I gonna pay it, let's double it. Let's double it. Oh, you didn't like your bonus. You didn't think 50 was enough. Let's throw in another 60. That's what Mr. Cohen wants you to believe happened in that meeting when Mr. Weisselberg walked in with that piece of paper and, supposedly, showed it to President Trump. That is absurd. All the other evidence, you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances. The first job Michael Cohen got at The Trump Organization, remember, was to make sure every bill that's owed, to not have to pay it, pay as little as possible. Now, by the way, his version of events with the campaign are belied by other evidence. He told you he deserved the extra bonus than the normal bonus he normally gets because of all the work on the campaign. What did Ms. Hicks tell you about Mr. Cohen's role? He did things that frustrated the campaign staff, that were frustrating, and at times he went rogue. That's not things justifying a larger bonus. Now, this is the document that we've seen a lot, People's Exhibit 35. This is the document Mr. Cohen tells you he discussed with Mr. Weisselberg right before they walked into President Trump's office. Well, the point of this document is: It contains lies. Again, you have to accept -- if you accept Mr. Cohen's version of what happened, that they were all in this together, that Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Cohen, President Trump were all in this together, but the document that the People offer to prove it is full of lies -- the Red Finch, we've already been through a couple of times, is absolutely a lie. The fact they're going to double it up, gross it up is a lie. And let's talk about that for a minute. Now, here's what Mr. Cohen told you about the grossed up concept. He told you that he had no idea and that he didn't even care. He said: \"What, if any, understanding do you have about why he grossed up that reimbursement up to 360?\" \"I don't know. And, to be honest, I didn't really even think about it. I just wanted to get my money back.\" What evidence do you have, what evidence do you have that this gross up is anything to do with taxes? That's it. That's your proof. Supposedly, Weisselberg said something about grossing it up to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen says, \"I don't know.\" Is there any other proof of that?  Any other evidence?  No. There's none. Mr. McConney said something very similar. When asked what Mr. Weisselberg maybe meant by \"gross it up\":  \"Nobody would know. Nobody would know.\" So, the witnesses that testified in this courtroom, one says, \"I didn't know and I didn't care,\" and the other says, \"Nobody would know.\" And based on that, I suggest, the Government is going to suggest to you that there may have been some sort of tax scheme involved here, as well. That's it. That's the proof. You saw no evidence of the tax scheme by anybody for this $420,000. Not The Trump Organization. Not the personal expenses for President Trump. Not even Mr. Cohen. Now, there is also notes, as you remember, from Mr. McConney, where he also took notes from a separate meeting that he had with Mr. Weisselberg. Now, here's something else that's very important about these notes. Remember when Mr. Cohen told you that he visited the White House in February; remember that? We put a photo up of him. And we saw his calendar entry that he was going to the White House. So, this meeting was early February; okay. He talked about it. It was a big day. Now, what did he tell you about that? He told you that he's going to the Oval Office for the first time in his life, meeting his boss, the man he's worked for for nine-and-a-half years, achieved this amazing thing of becoming President of the United States, but they had a conversation about the checks, about the money. That's what he wants you to believe. Oh, yes, we confirmed it. President Trump said, \"Do you need money? Do you want me to write you a check?\" And I said, \"No.\" That's what he wants you to believe. But, hold on a second. Just six days later, on February 14, 2017  -- Mr. Cohen had visited the White House on February 8th -- Mr. Cohen sends an email back to Mr. McConney, asking: \"Hey. How much does the monthly retainer run again? What am I supposed to do?\" This is after Mr. McConney emailed him and said: \"Hey. Send us an invoice if you want to get paid. Jeff.\" \"Please remind me of the monthly amount?\" So, Mr. Cohen wants you to believe February 8th he was in the Oval Office for the first time after Mr. Trump became President of the United States, they have a confirmatory Agreement about the scheme and why you're here, but just six days later, Cohen doesn't even know how much it's supposed to be. So, the last thing I want to say about the notes that we were looking at earlier about Mr. Weisselberg is -- the notes that you now see next to the -- next to the notes, which are the notes that Mr. McConney told you he took after a separate conversation with Mr. Weisselberg. First of all, Mr. McConney's notes don't reflect 180,000. They don't say what it's for. It just has it written. It says \"times two\". It also suggests that the money is going to come out of President Trump's personal account, which, as you recall, for the first three months it didn't. There was confusion. So, the point is, if you accept the Government's position that there was this agreed-upon scheme in January, why would Weisselberg say to Mr. McConney things that end up not happening? Why was it the Trump Org -- excuse me -- Trump Trust documents paid the first three months if there was this Agreement reached amongst President Trump, Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg? Now, also, you have these. Right? They're in evidence. Why are they in evidence? If this is some document, some evidence of a crime, how come, as you heard from Mr. McConney, he took both of these documents and he put them in the record where he keeps all the records for the Payroll Department in his office? He didn't get rid of them. He didn't try to discard them. This is a case about false filings, about false business records. And, yet, the supposed evidence of the false filing were in the records of President Trump's personal account, in the payroll cabinet of Mr. McConney's office. Does that make sense? So, for all those reasons, you don't have to go further, President Trump is not guilty. But -- but, I expect that you're going to be -- that you're going to hear from Judge Merchan that there's something else that has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government has to prove to you that President Trump caused these entries -- so, caused these entries, even if false, with an intent to defraud. That means, like, a conscious objective, a purpose to defraud. There is no evidence of that, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, the records aren't false. But, even if they were, where is the part of \"intent to defraud\" by President Trump? And how do you know there's no intent to defraud? Well, you saw in evidence that The Trump Organization reported this. There's a 1099 that reflects the payments from The Trust and also from President Trump's personal account to Michael Cohen. Now, there's nothing false or misleading about the 1099s. It's like any 1099 you give somebody who is working for you. So, if there was some deep-rooted intent to defraud, why do you think it was reported to the IRS as exactly what it was, to Michael Cohen as President Trump's Personal Attorney? Now, Mr. McConney is the only witness who testified about the 1099s at this trial, and he told you that there is no way on the 1099 Form, as you can see there, to differentiate between whether it's a legal service or a various expense. You just mark it, and you send it to the person who works for you -- in this case, Michael Cohen -- and it's his responsibility to deal with it with the IRS. There's nothing criminal about that at all. It's the way it's supposed to be done. So, that's one reason why there's no intent to defraud. But, also, you can look -- by the way, these Forms are in evidence, so you don't have to take my word for it. But, they're exactly accurate. Mr. Cohen, at the time, was a non-employee at The Trump Organization. He was a Personal Attorney to President Trump, an outside attorney. And the payments were compensation to him. Period. Nothing false. Now, we offered these documents through Mr. McConney. Not the Government."

    "text": "They're important. It shows that The Trump Organization disclosed these payments. They disclosed these payments to the IRS, both from The Trust and from President Trump's personal account. How else do you know there's no intent to defraud? Well, you saw President Trump send out a Tweet in 2018, saying exactly what he did. If there was an intent to defraud, why would he do that? Now, finally, you saw that there was a document submitted after President Trump was in Office to the Office of Government Ethics where, again, the payment was disclosed to the Federal Government. He signed the Form, and an agency official concluded he was in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. You can see the language that's described there. It's a little small. \"In the interest of transparency,\" while not required to do so, the payments to Mr. Cohen were disclosed. So, how can it be there's any intent, intent to defraud by President Trump, when he discloses it to the IRS, he Tweets about it, and he submits it on his Office of Government Ethics Forms? So, I'm going to talk a little bit now about what I expect the Government will talk about, which is a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. I don't even think you have to get to this, because with what we just talked about, with the way the Forms were filed, the way that they were booked on President Trump's personal records, there's no crime. Period. But, even if -- even if you get to ask yourself about any conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, I expect that you will find President Trump is not guilty. Now, the Government's theory is that in 2017 -- so, after the election; the election is November 2016 -- President Trump caused false filings, which we just talked about, to be made on books of his personal records to promote a candidacy in an election that he had already won. The charges relate to documents in 2017. And the Government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before. By the way, even that, even if you find that's true, that's still not enough. It doesn't matter -- as I said to you in the opening statement, it doesn't matter if there was a conspiracy to try to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy from another candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win. In order for you to find that there was an intent to conceal an election-related crime, you have to find that this effort was done by unlawful means. I expect the Government will talk about three separate unlawful means. Okay. One. Federal campaign finance violations. Two. Tax violations. And then, the third is his other books and records violations. But, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about all three of those. None of them make any sense. Let's talk for a minute about that August 2015 meeting that you heard a lot about from Mr. Pecker and you heard about from Mr. Cohen. That's, supposedly, where this conspiracy starts. There's an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. David Pecker, President Trump, Michael Cohen is there, and at times, supposedly, Hope Hicks was in and out. Well, what you heard is that Mr. Pecker agreed that he would be the eyes and ears for the campaign, that AMI would do what they could to publish flattering stories about President Trump and that AMI would attack President Trump's opponents. But -- this is from Mr. Pecker's testimony, ladies and gentlemen. This is the same thing AMI had been doing for decades. They had been doing it for President Trump since the Nineties. Mr. Pecker told you that AMI purchases stories all the time. They purchased stories about Tiger Woods, Mark Wahlberg and other people. And this was good business for them. Mr. Pecker told you this allowed him to have a mutually beneficial -- a mutually beneficial relationship with celebrities. He talked about Ron Perlman, Rahm Emanuel. He also told you it wasn't unique to President Trump; that, in fact, many politicians work with the media to try to promote their image. No crime. He said, actually, it was standard operating procedure to do so. It's how you try to win elections. And not just President Trump's campaign. Other presidential candidates did it long before 2016. It wasn't just Mr. Pecker. Hope Hicks told you exactly the same thing. It's not uncommon for campaigns to work with the media to run campaign themes. It's a regular practice. Again, this isn't surprising. Campaigns want to amplify the good things about their candidate and expose the bad things about their opponents. Again, this is a campaign. This is an election. This is not a crime. Even Mr. Cohen told you exactly the same thing. He spent decades working the media to help him or to help President Trump push forward a story or a version of events or to suppress something that's being told. Again, nothing criminal. Nothing criminal about it. It's done all the time. Remember, Mr. Pecker gave you that story, gave you an example of something that happened with him and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Do you remember that? It was a while ago. He told you that he had helped Mr. Schwarzenegger suppress stories from more than 30 women, including a book that had been written. Mr. Pecker told you that he had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this. Indeed, it even led to an investigation by the California State authorities and changed AMI. But, as to this courtroom, there were no charges brought, no criminal charges brought as a result of that. Now, remember another story that Mr. Pecker told you about another person running for election -- elected office named Rahm Emanuel. It's Ari Emanuel's brother, who is a big power-broker, apparently. What Mr. Pecker told you, that in 2010/2011, he helped suppress a story about an affair that Mr. Emanuel had had to help Mr. Emanuel run for Office in Illinois. There were no issues with the Federal Election Commission. There were no claims that any laws were broken. And, by the way, that's exactly why Mr. Pecker believed that what he was doing when he met with President Trump and Mr. Cohen in 2015 was perfectly legal."

    "text": "So, you have decades, decades of AMI doing exactly the same thing with respect to stories, working with celebrities and politicians to promote campaigns and suppress negative stories. There's zero criminal intent in that 2015 meeting. Indeed, Mr. Pecker told you that it was really good business to work with President Trump. He explained to you that the positive stories actually started when President Trump started running The Apprentice in the early Two Thousands. As far back as 1988, Mr. Pecker told you that he had helped suppress a story for Mr. Trump. 1988. That's 17 years ahead of the August 2015 meeting. And, again, in 2007 -- so, eight years before the August 2015 meeting -- Mr. Pecker told you he started to work with Mr. Cohen to help President Trump. So, this had been going on for decades. It had been going on for eight years with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker. And they were friends. No dispute about that. Mr. Pecker said that a couple of times. But, this was also not just about friendship. This was good business for AMI. They made a lot of money based on relationships. Not surprising. And then, in 2015, when they had that meeting, there is no doubt that one of the reasons why Mr. Pecker agreed to it was that it was good for business. He told you that President Trump was absolutely the top celebrity that helped sell magazines. And of course Pecker wanted to make money. He ran the company. And so, it's not just -- by the way, it's not just Pecker being greedy and wanting money for himself. He had shareholders. It was his fiduciary duty to make money for his shareholders by promoting President Trump. Again, not a conspiracy. No criminal intent. It's AMI doing what they do and what they have done for decades. Now -- so, there's nothing wrong -- and I said this in our opening statement -- with a politician like President Trump trying to get positive stories and avoid negative ones. Nothing criminal about that. But, let's be clear about something else. The idea, even if there was something wrong with it, the idea that sophisticated people like President Trump and David Pecker believed that positive stories in the National Enquirer could influence the 2016 election is preposterous. Mr. Pecker told you that the National Enquirer's circulation at that time period, in 2016, was around 350,000. The New York Times' circulation was many, many multiples of that number. Millions and millions of people voted in the 2016 election. So, the idea that they really thought this meeting at Trump Tower in 2015 would ultimately influence the election makes no sense. And here -- by the way, here's why that matters. The Government wants you to believe that in August of 2015, Mr. Pecker, President Trump and Michael Cohen all got together in President Trump's office and said: Okay. We're going to commit a crime. Let's enter into a conspiracy, a conspiracy to influence the election in 2016. And that's what they came up with. Now, what were they gonna do? You saw a bunch of the -- a bunch of the articles in this trial that have also been published by the National Enquirer about negative stories about the folks running against President Trump and positive stories about President Trump. But, what did they actually discuss at that meeting? What did Mr. Pecker tell you that they actually discussed? There was no in-depth discussion -- and Mr. Cohen tried to tell you that there was. There was no in-depth discussion about how they would get together and publish really negative stories or really positive stories. It was just a general discussion that Mr. Pecker told you about in 2015 of an effort to try and help President Trump. So, remember, also, that a lot of the stories that the National Enquirer ran were just recycled. Remember, many of the stories had already been published by other organizations. All the stories that you see on the screen. Now, the idea that the National Enquirer could corruptly, criminally influence an election by republishing stories that had already been out there in other forums should, hopefully, make you shake your head. It makes no sense. Now, remember what the Government told you about this August 2015 meeting and what happened thereafter. Now, what they told you -- remember the words \"catch and kill\". They told you -- I'm going to talk to you about the three \"catch and kills\" they put in front of you in this trial. Remember, they told you this was the heart of the Agreement, the catch and kill scheme. But, they didn't even discuss catch and kill at the August 2015 meeting. Mr. Pecker told you that. Mr. Cohen didn't dispute that. There were no financial arrangements discussed at that meeting. Think about that. The Government wants to you believe that the three stories we're going to talk about -- Ms. McDougal, Ms. Daniels, and Dino Sajudin -- were the essence of the catch and kill scheme between Mr. Cohen, AMI and Mr. Trump. And it wasn't even discussed at the time the conspiracy was formed. No financial discussion. No discussion about catch and kill. Think about that. So, Mr. Pecker told you about the first time that he heard \"catch and kill\", and he said it was from the investigation. And then, on redirect, he was asked whether he actually read it in an article. And he said, yes, he read it in an article earlier, but make no mistake about it, there was no catch and kill discussed at this August 2015 meeting when this supposed conspiracy was born. So, let's talk for a few minutes about the catch and kill scheme. Keep in mind, there is nothing unusual -- Mr. Pecker told you this -- about catching and killing. What did Mr. Pecker tell you? He said they only published about half the stories that they bought. Half the stories. Half the stories. So -- and, by the way, Mr. Pecker knows a lot; right. He took the stand a month ago. I know that you've seen a lot of testimony since then. But, he's been in this industry for decades; and so, when he talks about the work that he had done over the years and the way that he ran AMI, he was speaking from experience. So, when he tells you that he had never heard \"catch and kill\" until the investigation or until a news article about it sometime relatively recently, that's meaningful. That's meaningful. When he tells you that half the stories that the National Enquirer buys, they don't publish, that's meaningful. That matters. So, let's talk about the three catch and kills. The first one. Dino Sajudin. A supposed love child. Completely 100 percent false. Everybody told you that. Literally, a made-up story, designed to harm President Trump. Not true. And also harm his employees and folks that work for him. This happened -- this bubbled up a few months after the August 2015 meeting. Right? We're still in 2015. And what did Mr. Pecker tell you about when he learned about this? He said that he was always going to do what was best for AMI, and that if this story was true, he was publishing it. He said it would have been the biggest story AMI had ever had. He estimated he could have sold ten million National Enquirers and that he had a fiduciary obligation to his shareholders to sell the story. That doesn't sound like a catch and kill at all. Now, Pecker told you he never discussed the story directly with President Trump, he just talked to Mr. Cohen about it, and that makes good sense. Remember, he told you that he was trying to figure out what was true. If it was true, he was going to publish it. So, he wasn't talking to President Trump about it. This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity. The biggest story we ever had. Ten million copies. It was worth too much to catch and kill. Full stop. You can see when he talked about that, Mr. Pecker was, in fact, truthful about that. On redirect, he said: Oh, I wouldn't have published it until after the election. But, that doesn't make any sense. He was trying to verify this story in 2015, months and months before the election in 2016. It would have been the biggest story the National Enquirer ever had. Think about that. The Government wants you to believe that in August of 2015, there was this super conspiratorial criminal meeting where Mr. Pecker is going to help -- criminally help President Trump win the election, and the first opportunity he gets to really work this conspiracy, really help President Trump, he says: No, no, no. I'm publishing this. I'm publishing this. What kind of conspiracy is that? The first opportunity you have to really do your thing with your co-conspirators and suppress a story and catch and kill a story: No. This is the biggest story ever. I'm going to figure out if it's true. And if it's true, I'm going to publish it. That's the evidence. That's what you heard. The reason they didn't publish this story, by the way, was it catch and kill?  No. It's because it was false. The story was not true. That's why it was never published. So, if you look at the original Agreement between AMI and Mr. Sajudin, dated November 15, 2015, totally standard document as you heard, nothing unusual, they were going to pay $30,000 if they published the story. Nothing unusual. That's the way the National Enquirer normally did it. And a 90-day period of exclusivity. Again, Mr. Pecker told you that was all standard. So, AMI is just doing what it always does. Then what happened? A little bit later, in December of that same year, they amended the Agreement; and under the Amendment, AMI owed $30,000 to Mr. Sajudin, and they paid it. And it lasted forever. This Agreement never expired. And Mr. Sajudin could never talk about it, or he would owe a lot of money. And what did Mr. Pecker tell you about why -- why they did this, why they switched and actually paid him the money, without actually writing a story?  He told you that Mr. Sajudin was threatening to go someplace else, and they had to see if that story was true. So, if they didn't agree to pay him $30,000, there was a risk he would go somewhere else. And, again, if that was a true story, that was getting published. \"That's why he decided to pay Mr. Sajudin; correct?\" \"Yes.\" \"Mr. Pecker told you the reason why he did that is because it was still possible, in his mind, that that story was true?\" \"That is correct.\" That is not a catch and kill. It's just not. Mr. Cohen, when he talked about this, by the way, he lied to you again. He lied to you about the Amendment. He says he told President Trump about the details regarding Mr. Sajudin. He said he did that because he wanted to take credit. He wanted to take credit with President Trump. But, you can see that he really -- when we cross-examine him on this issue, he really didn't even fight. He, admittedly, didn't tell President Trump all the details. He never told President Trump details like this."

    "text": "Again, on direct he says one thing; on cross he says another. He is not telling the truth. He's lying. So, Mr. Cohen, by the way, used \"credit\" constantly; right. He constantly said to you he wanted credit. He wanted credit from President Trump. He did something because he wanted credit. He kept President Trump updated because he wanted to take credit for himself. He told you that repeatedly on direct and, also, on cross. Why do you think he did that? That's the same phrase that Hope Hicks used in describing Mr. Cohen. She described Mr. Cohen as being \"Somebody who always wanted credit\". Mr. Cohen admitted to you that he was following this trial before he testified. Just think about that for a minute. He came in here and testified two weeks ago, but admitted, because he had to, that he had been following the trial earlier in the trial. Why do you think, suddenly, \"credit\" was part of his story? Is that something that can be trusted as the truth?  Absolutely not. I want to talk now about Ms. McDougal. That's the second catch and kill; right. Now, Ms. McDougal didn't testify at this trial, but you heard about her affair. Again, just like Mr. Sajudin, there was never any money paid by Michael Cohen or President Trump to AMI for anything involving Ms. McDougal's story. But, what is clear from what you heard about Ms. McDougal, this was not a catch and kill, either. Everybody said the same thing. Karen McDougal did not want her story published. Catch and kill:  We're going to catch a story from being published, to keep it from being published, and then we're going to kill it. Ms. McDougal didn't want her story published. She wanted to kick-start her career. She wanted to be on the covers of magazines. She wanted to write articles. She didn't want to publish the story. She wanted to write articles with AMI. And, again, she did that. Again, how is that a catch and kill?  It's not. So -- and her attorney said the same thing. It wasn't one side. He told you, Mr. Davidson said she did not want to publish her article. You can see it on the screen: \"Ms. McDougal did not want to publish an article about the claims that have been discussed here; right?\" \"True.\" You can see, one of her friends forced her hands, the friend that publicized Ms. McDougal's allegations, so she was trying to take advantage of the situation. To be clear, it was not Ms. McDougal's intention to publish her story. And, again, the reason why this matters, the reason why the details of what happened back in 2016 matter to you and should matter to you is that there was never any risk that her allegation would influence the election, because she didn't want her allegations published. Remember why you're thinking about these incidents. It's because the Government has alleged a conspiracy to influence the election. And the second of the three didn't want to influence the election at all. She didn't want her story published. So, she was paid $150,000. No question about that. You saw the documents, and you heard the testimony. But, remember why. Ms. McDougal had an entourage around her. Remember, Davidson took 45 percent of the $150,000. You also heard about a bodyguard. That was Johnny Crawford, who was a police officer, who was providing security. All of them would be compensated. And you also heard about her manager, Gene Rodriguez, who was also compensated. All these people around Ms. McDougal wanted to make money. Of course. So, whatever she ended up with from 150,000 was not much and, again, did not seem to bother her because that was not her motive. She wanted to be on the cover of magazines. She wanted to write articles. She was not trying to get her story published and then have it caught and killed. So -- let's talk about what happened -- again, the legality of the situation. Okay. So, you have the Government's argument that what happened here was, somehow, important. Okay. There was something wrong about to happen. That's not what Mr. Pecker talked about and not what he told you. Remember, he told you that he consulted with an attorney."

He told you that because it's true. So, I want to talk for just a minute about AMI's Non-Prosecution Agreement. And I know we're going back a few weeks, so, remember, Mr. Pecker told you that at the time this Agreement was entered into, the National Enquirer, AMI was in the process of being bought, there was a proposed deal, and that this investigation, the investigation into the McDougal situation had to be cleaned up. He told you, yes, that's correct. So, remember, there was a resolution. AMI entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement. No dispute about that. But, remember what Judge Merchan told you about that Agreement; that Agreement, AMI's Non-Prosecution Agreement, the Conciliatory Agreement that they entered into at the same time is evidence of nothing as relates to President Trump's guilt."

    "text": "Neither the Agreement, the Non-Prosecution Agreement or the Conciliatory Agreement is evidence of the defendant's guilt. Indeed, you are not allowed to consider it in determining whether President Trump is guilty of the charged crimes. That's important. That's important. Now, so, with that caveat, with that in mind, what does the McDougal story tell you about why we're here?  If it shows you anything, it's just more evidence that Michael Cohen is a liar. He told you time and time again about things that he claimed happened, conversations that he claimed he had around this Agreement that are just not true. So, let's look at a couple of those. He lied to you about a conversation that he claims he overheard between President Trump and David Pecker. Mr. Pecker told you that he was at an investor meeting in New Jersey. Remember that. He was at an investor meeting in New Jersey at Chatham Asset Management, and that President Trump reached out to Mr. Pecker at his office, and that they were able to reach Mr. Pecker on his phone. Now, Mr. Pecker told you that at the end of the call, President Trump said to him, \"I don't buy stories. I don't buy stories.\"  Then he said, \"Cohen will call you.\" But what did Mr. Cohen claim happened in that conversation?  He didn't think it was good enough to say that President Trump doesn't buy stories. So, this is what he said about that call. He told you President Trump told Mr. Pecker:  No problem, I will take care of it. So that is a big difference; Mr. Pecker telling you that President Trump said, \"I don't buy stories,\" and Mr. Cohen coming in and saying, \"No problem, I will take care of it.\" And which one is true? You know that The Trump Organization, President Trump, Michael Cohen, never paid Mr. Pecker a penny for the McDougal story. There is no dispute about that. Now, let's talk about another lie. Remember when Cohen testified about a lunch that he supposedly had with David Pecker, and the Government -- the Government said, \"Directing your attention to September of 2016, did you have lunch with Mr. Pecker when he presented to you -- pressed you further?\" Again, this is when Mr. Cohen was saying that Mr. Pecker was really frustrated that he had not been paid for the McDougal story. They have lunch. Tell us a little bit about the lunch. We went to his favorite Italian restaurant. Again, he expressed his anger, \"I got to get this money back.\" Ladies and gentlemen, that lunch did not happen. Mr. Cohen made it up. Now, even if you want to credit the idea that Mr. Pecker just forgot about the lunch, he didn't testify about it at all, even if you want credit that, there would be other proof that the lunch happened, a credit card receipt, something besides Mr. Cohen's own words, but you saw none of that. I am going to tell you why that matters. When key meetings and key conversations are remembered with clarity from 2016 by Mr. Cohen -- think about that -- 2016, you heard testimony about a clear memory of conversations. You've got to check that. Is there something about those conversations that rings true?  Is there something beyond the words of Michael Cohen that suggests to you that those conversations, that those meetings, that those lunches actually happened. Now, we'll come back to the lunch in a moment, but there is something else to talk about now, which is, the phone call -- the recording that Mr. Cohen made of President Trump. Okay. So you have a lawyer recording his client, supposedly on September 6, 2016. And I say \"supposedly,\" because there is a lot of dispute about that recording. A lot. The Government has not shown you that that evidence is reliable, and I am going to talk about why. Let's start with the context. Now, Mr. Cohen told you that the reason why he had to tape this conversation with his client was so that he could play it to David Pecker. He was going to record his client, President Trump, and then play that back to Mr. Pecker, so that Mr. Pecker could be assured that money was coming. He wanted to reassure Mr. Pecker about President Trump's intentions. Now, he never did that. Right?  He told you he never actually played the recording for Mr. Pecker. That was just his reason for doing it. You could see that what happened, according to Mr. Cohen, is that there was another conversation that happened the day after, and then there was no reason because of that to play this recording to Mr. Pecker. But, remember, keep in mind the testimony about the lunch. Okay. When Pecker was, supposedly, still very angry, still angry about not getting paid back the money, and Cohen said that that happened in September of 2016 -- Labor Day, ladies and gentlemen, was September 5th, so the weekend before Labor Day, obviously, was the 4th and the 3rd, which leaves just two days, just two days in September that Mr. Cohen, supposedly, had this very angry lunch with Mr. Pecker. And Mr. Cohen wants you to believe that, somehow, in between this very angry lunch and the time that he recorded his client just a few days later, Mr. Pecker had calmed down. That makes no sense. It's just a lie. Now, talking about the recording itself, Mr. Cohen explained to you that he walked in, put his voice notes on. That's what he said to you. And Rhona Graff, right, you heard from Ms. Graff, President Trump's longtime assistant testified a couple of weeks ago that she was in and out of that meeting pretty regularly and was part of that conversation. We're going to listen to just a part of that conversation now."

Ms. Graff was there, but, yet, she's not asked a single question about this recording, a key recording that Mr. Cohen supposedly has, where he records President Trump about the McDougal deal. Not a single question. So, eventually -- and we're going to play a little bit more of that recorded conversation now. The conversation touches to AMI, Mr. Pecker. Go ahead."

That was because, supposedly, the National Enquirer had a box or a file of President Trump's stories that were never published or information about President Trump and there was an effort to buy that. You heard a lot of testimony about that. Mr. Pecker ultimately said, right, there wasn't anything of value in there. But, at the time, that was extremely important, because you heard that there was some negotiations with Mr. Pecker and Time Magazine. And as President Trump said, \"You never know what is going to happen\" to Mr. Pecker. It was extremely important at the time to be able to buy that box of stuff. There is no discussion about Karen McDougal. I mean, you could listen to the recording. They're talking about buying the stuff. And, you know, listen, the Government claims on the transcript that there is a word that Mr. Trump -- that President Trump says \"One-fifty.\" Listen to the recording. See if you hear \"One-fifty,\" or see if you have no idea what you are hearing at all. That is what Cohen says -- what Michael Cohen says is on that recording. You don't have to accept his words. You can listen to it on your own. There is a transcript. As Judge Merchan told you, the transcript is just an aid. It's actually the recording that is in evidence. Listen to the recording. Now, let's listen to the rest of that, please."

    "text": "So, if there was really \"One-fifty\" said, like the Government and Mr. Cohen claims, why is the next thing that you hear from Mr. Cohen, \"We'll have to pay him something,\" as if they're just willing to discuss the price. Why is that? I mean, the bottom line is, there is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker. There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal. So -- and you know that because then Mr. Cohen discussed the financing. And President Trump says \"Financing?  What financing?\"  He has no idea what Mr. Cohen is talking about. The Government wants you to believe that this is evidence that is furthering the conspiracy that was started in the August meeting in 2015, and Mr. Cohen is talking about financing. President Trump clearly has no idea what he is talking about. And, obviously, this conversation is Mr. Cohen and President Trump literally talking past each other about what is going on. And, you know, Mr. Cohen admitted this. He said that \"financing\" wasn't the best word to use. What he really meant to say was \"funding,\" not \"financing.\" But, President Trump is, obviously, in the real estate business. He knows what that means. And when the word \"financing\" came up, he was shocked, he didn't know what was going on. What are you talking about. So, the next thing that happens is significant. When Mr. Cohen was talking on direct about cash -- remember. Remember that, when the transfer talks about cash. And Mr. Cohen told you that he thought that President Trump was referring to green. It makes it more sinister, \"green,\" cold hard cash. Because, obviously, it sounds a lot more criminal if there is a big duffle bag filled with $150,000 in cash. But, as he admitted on cross-examination, cash just means no financing. President Trump is in the real estate business, and you can buy a building, you can buy a property with cash. It doesn't mean -- it doesn't mean that you're going into the closing with a duffle bag filled with \"green.\" That was Mr. Cohen lying to you, painting a picture that fits his narrative, not the truth. There is no scenario under which there has been any testimony in this trial that President Trump was going to walk around with a duffle bag filled of $150,000 in cash. That was just Mr. Cohen trying to paint the picture that fits his narrative that there is something sinister about what happened here. And then, the way that the conversation ends matters. Right?  Supposedly, the call is cut off because a phone call comes in. That is what Mr. Cohen tells you. And the last thing -- few things you hear on the recording and on the transcript is, you hear somebody say \"check.\" But it's not the end of a sentence. It's the beginning of a sentence. You have no idea what was said afterwards. You have no idea whether President Trump was saying; Check with my people, check to verify it. It's not talking about a check, like write me a check to pay me back. It's clearly talking about the beginning of a sentence that we will never know -- we will never know what was said. So, let's talk about how this call ends. Let's listen to the end of the recording."

    "text": "So, there is a comment by Mr. Cohen at the end of the recording. It's not on the transcript. He says hi to somebody. Maybe it's Don, maybe it's D-O-N, maybe it's D-A-W-N, it's not clear. It's not what he told you; hello, are you there. He told you that he got a phone call. He told you that he knew who the call was from. It was from somebody that worked at a bank. That's what he told you. He said that it was someone named Cathy Battle.  He said that he interrupted -- he interrupted this super secret conversation that he's recording with his client, with President Trump, to answer a phone call from Cathy Battle, who is apparently a bank manager at Capital One. That story alone is ridiculous. But, it gets much worse for Mr. Cohen when it comes to this recording. Because no matter what he said at the end of the recording, no matter what happened in that conversation after the recording ended, you have no idea, you don't know about the integrity of this file and this recording. And we're going to get to that. But, here's the thing that matters about his testimony. Mr. Cohen didn't actually take that call. And there is not really any dispute about that. So, there's a part of the records that are in evidence, Exhibit 400. The Government showed these to Mr. Cohen. And they drew his attention to this during his testimony. The features column says:  NIOP:CFNA:VM. You remember there was a witness from AT&T, Mr. Dixon, he told you what that means. This testimony is on the slide right in front of you. He told that you NIOP means incoming cal, and CFNA means call forward, no answer. So, this call went to voicemail. Whatever call that Mr. Cohen received went to voicemail. He didn't answer the phone and talk to Ms. Battle about something going on at the bank. It went right to voicemail. You see the \"F,\" there is an \"F\" in parenthesis. That \"F\" is for forwarded. It was forwarded to his voicemail. So, again, he lied to you when he said he answered that call. And, again, would it have been a big deal for him to say, I don't actually remember what happened, it was a really a long time ago; I don't think so. But he didn't do that. He lied to me. He lied to me. And, remember, this recording is being made, supposedly, so that Mr. Cohen can go and play it to David Pecker to calm him down. That's what he told you. But then he just never played it. He never played it. Apparently, it's the first time ever, and the only time ever he records his client to kind of salvage what was happening with him and Mr. Pecker, and then Mr. Pecker is not asked about it, Mr. Cohen said, \"I never played it for him.\" So, if anything, the McDougal story tells you a lot, tells you a lot more about Mr. Cohen. So, the last story we're going to talk about is a story involving Stormy Daniels. This is an event that supposedly happened in 2006, 18 years ago. President Trump and Ms. Daniels have repeatedly denied it took place. However, the story was published in 2011. Again, long before 2016, long before the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. So, how could this issue have influenced the election?  People already knew about the allegations. It was already a published story. So, what really happened here?  And I think you saw this from the testimony. Is that there were a group of people that wanted to take advantage of a situation and, ultimately, extort money from President Trump. That's what happened. People like Ms. Daniels, Ms. Rodriguez, her agents, Mr. Davidson. Remember when we asked Mr. Cohen if he actually believed it was an extortion attempt, he said yes, he did believe it was an extortion attempt. By the way, it was another opportunity for Mr. Cohen to actually take advantage. He made a decision to pay that $130,000 to Ms. Daniels. He didn't tell President Trump about it. He wanted to do it because he knew that he could get credit for doing something to supposedly help President Trump at some later time. Whether they won the election or lost the election, he would be able to get that credit. So, remember what is happening with him at the time. He was very worried about his future. You saw and heard multiple, multiple examples of that. He was worried about what would happen if President Trump won, he was worried about what would happen if President Trump lost, what he would be doing. People were not happy with him on the campaign. And so, he made this decision. The only person that suggests otherwise, the only person that comes in and tells you, oh, no, President Trump knew everything about this, is Michael Cohen himself. That's it. There is no other proof of that. There is no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen. Period. And you cannot. You cannot believe his words. Again, you heard a lot about what happened in 2011 with The Dirty. The fact that the story was published and then both Mr. Davidson and Mr. Cohen got it taken down and worked together to do that. You can see the testimony. Again, this goes back a few weeks, but you could see the testimony about that there on the screen. That there was  a post that talked about the allegations, and it was the same allegations that were made in 2016, and they were published. That was the first time Mr. Davidson encountered Mr. Cohen. And you also remember that even in 2011, Ms. Daniels and Mr. Davidson wanted to bring this down, wanted to bring the story down to try to make money. Remember, they were trying to get paid $15,000 by another magazine and the reason why it was really important to them that it come off The Dirty's website is because they would lose their ability to bargain. And you see that from Mr. Davidson. He told you that. They were really just trying to negotiate a better deal with a different magazine, In Touch. But, it doesn't really matter whether it was The Dirty, the Daily Mail, In Touch magazine, as it relates to the charges in this case. In 2011, Daniels' claims were already public. The public was aware of them. So, again, the idea that when Ms. Daniels surfaced in 2016, that it caused some sort of panic amongst everybody is not true. It's just not true. Now, as you know, in 2011, when everything happened with The Dirty, they were never paid. There was no money to be made. And years and years went by. But, then, again, it came to light in April 2016, Gina Rodriguez reminds Dylan Howard about Ms. Daniels. This is in April of 2016, two months, two months before Mr. Davidson brings up anything involving Ms. McDougal. This is actually ahead of the McDougal story in April of 2016. This is in the middle of the campaign, President Trump's campaign. The election is in November and this is in April. So, think about that for a minute, again, when you think about why we're here. If there was really a catch and kill, if there was really a catch and kill conspiratorial relationship, why did everybody ignore that story in April?  Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was some catch and kill scheme?  If these allegations by Ms. Daniels were as damaging as Mr. Cohen would have you believe or the Government would have you believe, why did nobody do anything about it in April of 2016, when it first resurfaced? Mr. Howard didn't do anything. He didn't raise any alarm bells. There is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Rodriguez outreached to him in April of 2016, which resulted in any communication with Mr. Cohen or with President Trump. So, let's look now to June of 2016. Dylan Howard writes to Gina Rodriguez, \"Not much pisses me off these days except Donald Trump.\" Now, there is no scenario under which Mr. Howard can be said to be part of this conspiracy. It appears he doesn't like President Trump at all. He despises him. So, right now in the middle of the election, middle of 2016, Ms. Daniels and Ms. Rodriguez were kicking off a  plot again to try and get some money from President Trump. And by this time the candidacy is in full swing, the election is ongoing, and now they're being a lot more aggressive than they were in 2011. Now Mr. Howard is willing to help them. He wants to help Ms. Daniels and Ms. Rodriguez to get money. That's not a conspiracy involving Mr. Pecker, President Trump and Michael Cohen. It's Mr. Howard working very closely with Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Daniels to figure out a way to get money. Now, I have said this a lot, but I will say it again now. You didn't hear from Gina Rodriguez, and you did  not hear from Dylan Howard in this trial. So, a lot of what we're saying and a lot of what I expect the Government will say is speculation. We don't really know what happened. We don't really know what they meant when they texted what is on the screen there. But, we do know that Mr. Davidson was willing to help. And you know that Mr. Davidson has made a career out of trying to extort people, just like he did with President Trump. You heard about a sex tape involving Hulk Hogan. And you heard -- remember, by the way, that Dylan Howard wrote an article, he was the author of an article in the National Enquirer in 2015 involving the Hulk Hogan incident. Do you think that is a coincidence. Mr. Davidson also told you that he worked with the guy who was a sex tape broker. Literally, the guy's job is to help extort people by threatening to release a private audio, a private video, if the person that they're targeting doesn't give them money. You heard that he did this with multiple people over the years; Lindsay Lohan, Charlie Sheen, and others. And, you know, by the way, that Mr. Cohen admitted that Davidson -- Mr. Davidson and this crew, including Daniels, were trying to extort President Trump. Mr. Davidson made it clear to you that when he was talking to Cohen about the fact that Daniels wanted money, plain and simple, she was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage to get paid. We're going to play just a portion of that recording that you heard."

    "text": "All right. So, continuing with Ms. Daniels' situation in 2016. So, the question for you is:  Was what happened with Ms. Daniels in 2016 consistent with the conspiracy, the conspiracy that the People tell you Mr. Cohen, President Trump and David Pecker entered into in 2015? And the reason why we are going through the details, the reasons we are going through the recordings and what was said and not said is because that is what matters, is whether the conduct and what you heard about Ms. Daniels and what led to the NDA by Mr. Cohen in October is a conspiratorial arrangement as charged by the Government or something else. And that's why we are going through all of this evidence right now. And remember, both, repeatedly -- Ms. Daniels has denied, has denied that there was ever any sex with President Trump in 2018, and earlier before that. And we can look at those statements here, but what did you hear about those statements? The Government wants you to believe that those statements were coerced, that Ms. Daniels was either forced to sign them or didn't really have a say in signing them. But think about something. She, Ms. Daniels, decided to go public after these statements, supposedly because she was trying to protect herself from what she said was a threat someone made to her in a gym parking lot in 2011, so five years before. But, there are recordings where you know that that's just not true. Mr. Davidson told Mr. Cohen directly in 2018, that Mr. Avenatti, who you remember ended up being Ms. Daniels lawyer, Gina Rodriguez and Ms. Daniels were lying about these threats. They never happened. But, the recording makes clear that Ms. Daniels lied to you about it. She was just working with Mr. Davidson, with Ms. Rodriguez and with Dylan Howard to try to get money from President Trump in the Fall of 2016. Now -- and, again, keep in mind that just like Ms. McDougal when Ms. Daniels got paid, she didn't even keep all of that money, right? Rodriguez and Davidson kept a big chunk of that money, 25 percent of the $130,000 that she was paid, so $24,000. And then what happened in 2018? So, we are fast-forwarding a little bit. What happened that made Ms. Daniels want to go public with her story? Well, what happened was something that was worth a lot more than $130,000. Mr. Davidson told you during his testimony that another person named Larry Flynt offered to pay Ms. Daniels' legal fees to try to encourage her to make her false accusations public. Now, we are going to play some of the audio here. Mr. Davidson told you something similar to Mr. Cohen in March of 2018. We will play that now."

    "text": "Mr. Davidson called -- I am sorry. Mr. Davidson called that settler's remorse. So, at the end of the day, what really happened was that somebody offered more money to Ms. Daniels, somebody offered to pay her legal fees if she could get out of the NDA that she had signed with Mr. Cohen. And then she wrote a book and she has a podcast and a documentary. This started out as an extortion. There is no doubt about that. And it ended very well for Ms. Daniels, financially speaking. Now, so, what is clear from the evidence, now going back to 2016, the Agreement that Ms. Daniels entered into, is that there was a separate conspiracy between Ms. Daniels, Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard, and that their goal was to make as much money as possible off of President Trump selling Ms. Daniels' story. It had nothing to do with August 2015. It was a completely separate goal that they had regarding Ms. Daniels and selling her story. And, again -- I said this a couple of times, but it's true. There is nothing wrong with a Non-Disclosure Agreement. There is nothing illegal. There is nothing sinister about it. This is standard. There is nothing criminal about the fact that Mr. Cohen and Ms. Daniels and Mr. Davidson entered into an Agreement in October of 2016. There is also no evidence, as I said a few minutes ago, except for Mr. Cohen's words, that President Trump knew about that Agreement in 2016. And you can look, by the way, just for a few minutes, at the texts between Gina Rodriguez and Dylan Howard. Are you working in favor of Trump? Mr. Howard, I am not, no. He references David Pecker's endorsement of Trump and makes it clear that he is not part of this effort from the Summer of 2015 meeting, and this is starting in April. And so, again, you know he wasn't part of the effort because if he was part of the effort to catch and kill stories in April, there would have been an effort to catch and kill the Daniels story, and there wasn't. So, what's clear is that Mr. Howard had nothing to do with this conspiracy. He didn't want President Trump to get elected. He didn't want President Trump to be successful. And, again, the texting into June, 2016, which again, is the exact timeframe, remember, that Pecker and Mr. Howard are dealing with the McDougal situation, and so, if there was really -- if it was really true that the Daniels situation was part of this catch and kill scheme, if they were truly part of the same plan, there is no question that Dylan Howard would have told Mr. Pecker about it in June, and that's -- and also President Trump. It didn't happen. And so, in fact, a week before the June 28th text messages that you are looking at, Mr. Davidson told Mr. Howard that he was drafting a declaration of representation to send. This is the second text message on the screen that you have in front of you. He is talking about Karen McDougal because at that point they weren't planning to buy her story either, in June. Howard had, remember, remember Mr. Howard had gone on a trip to Los Angeles on June 20th to meet with Mr. Davidson and Ms. McDougal. They were going to discuss the allegations and see if there was enough proof. Mr. Howard reported back to Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen about the allegations. And they said:  You know what, we are not going to move forward. Her story was not corroborated. That's not a catch and kill, Ladies and Gentlemen. That is AMI doing what it always does. But, if there was some agreement to suppress negative stories, do you think that that would have happened, that Mr. Howard would have went to Los Angeles, met with Ms. McDougal, asked her for corroboration, and then said:  We are not going to buy this story. We don't think it's true? So, what did happen? What happened was, after that Access Hollywood tape came out, Ms. Daniels and Ms. Rodriguez sees an opportunity. They came back to Mr. Howard again and said: Okay, now; now is the time to strike. And October 8, 2016, the day after the Access Hollywood tape was released, Ms. Rodriguez reminded Mr. Howard about Ms. Daniels. She made claims about Fox News, The Dirty. None of that has been verified because that's what it says on the text. The election was about a month away at this point. And at this point, Dylan Howard, if you are going to believe what you see on the text exchanges, believes that there was enough leverage, based on the election, to get AMI to get Mr. Pecker to pay Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Daniels. See at the bottom, Mr. Howard says that Pecker will likely pay, likely will pay. And you know, by the way, that he was wrong, right? He was wrong. Pecker told you as much. He didn't want anything to do with the Stormy Daniels allegation. You can see that in the October 9th text that you have on the screen, and he testified about that. So, again, we are here talking about a conspiracy between Mr. Pecker, President Trump and Michael Cohen to catch and kill stories. The Dino story, completely not true, never ran. Ms. McDougal didn't want her story out, just wanted to get back in the magazine business and write some articles, which worked. You heard Mr. Cohen say that she was on the front cover of a magazine, Men's Health, and they sold more copies than they had ever sold in the past. That's not catch and kill here. And you have Ms. Daniels coming forward right off the Access Hollywood interview. This is our chance, now we can really make your conspiracy work, the catch and kill scheme. This is it. And David Pecker is like, nah, I want nothing to do with it. That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills? I want nothing to do with it. I am not buying that story. That's what they are telling you that this is a catch and kill conspiracy. And the first thing when presented right after the day of the -- the Access Hollywood tape comes out, David Pecker is told by Mr. Howard, we have this conspiracy with President Trump and Michael Cohen, we got to catch, we got to kill. And David Pecker says, no way, I am not going to do it. I mean -- and you can see that, ultimately, what happened was Ms. Daniels and Mr. Rodriguez, they actually, raise their price, right? It originally had been $100,000 for the story. Now, it's 120,000 in October 2016 because the act Hollywood tape came out. So, now it's time to strike. And then just as you all heard a lot of testimony about, the Access Hollywood tape was released October 7, 2016, a month before the election. The tape itself was from 2005, eleven years earlier. And as you heard from witnesses, this was an extremely personal event for President Trump. Nobody -- and, again, I am just going to state the obvious. Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that sort of thing. Doesn't matter whether you are running for office. Doesn't matter if you are running The Apprentice. It just doesn't matter if you are just a normal every day person in the city. Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story. Ms. Hicks testified and gave you a window into that. She told you about what it was like working with him. The night that that was released, the next morning he was concerned about his family. He was concerned about his wife. Ms. Hicks told you that. But, the Government wants you to believe that the release of that tape from 2005 was so catastrophic to the campaign that it provided a motive, a motive for President Trump to do something criminal. But there is no evidence of that. President Trump did not react to the Access Hollywood tape in any way the Government is suggesting. You heard this from Ms. Westerhout, who you remember at the time she worked for the Republican -- she worked for President Trump. She made it clear that President Trump didn't freak out. She was working for the Republican National Committee at that time and, also, then went to work for President Trump directly. So, she had a personal vantage point at that point into the campaign and into the issues. Ms. Hicks testified about this as well. She was, of course, concerned about the tape and, of course, again, there is no surprise there. It wasn't helpful. And I am not suggesting that it was not a big deal for the campaign. Of course not. It was. But on October 8th when a recording was released, Ms. Hicks said that she was concerned about the story being part of the next several days at least. This was a month before the election. Again, the version that says anything different comes from one witness, Michael Cohen. You heard the politicians reacted negatively to the Access Hollywood tape. They didn't testify. You heard that there was even talk about something consequential for President Trump, who was a Republican nominee, But none of that happened. None of that is true. You heard that President Trump and his campaign got ready for the debate, responded to the allegations, and continued campaigning. So, as Ms. Westerhout told you, as I just said, there were a couple days of frustration and consternation, but that happens all the time in campaigns, and we know that. I spent some time talking about that because the Access Hollywood tape is being set up in this trial to be something that it is not. It was one of many stressful stories and issues that came up during the 2016 campaign. It was not a doomsday event. President Trump, as you saw, addressed it in a video that was addressed to the -- released to the American public. He addressed it in a debate a couple days later. He never thought that it was going to cost him to lose the campaign and, indeed, it didn't. So, Michael Cohen, however, had a different view. Michael Cohen told you that he realized it was catastrophic, and he wanted to do something about it, and that's exactly what he did. With respect to Ms. Daniels -- so, by the way, Ms. Daniels told you that she did not testify in the Grand Jury in this case. Why did they call her as a witness at trial? There was no dispute that there was an NDA signed. There was no dispute that the charges have to do with filings, The Trump Organization, the personal records of President Trump in 2017, something that Ms. Daniels knew nothing about. So, why? I will tell you why. They did it to try to inflame your emotions. They did it to try to embarrass President Trump."

    "text": "That's why, Ladies and Gentlemen. Now, AMI told you, and you know from Mr. Pecker and from the records, that they were not a party to the Stormy Daniels NDA. Of course not. They were party to many, many efforts to buy stories over the years, but not this one. Virtually every one of those Agreements that AMI entered into you heard contained similar non-disclosure provisions. It's basic. It's standard. Mr. Davidson told you something similar. He was frequently involved in NDAs and that they always contained similar provisions to the one in this case. There was nothing out of the ordinary about them. So nothing was criminal in entering into this NDA and, indeed, nothing was inappropriate. That doesn't mean that when President Trump is campaigning out in October he knew about it. It just means it wasn't inappropriate. The only person at trial that told you President Trump knew about it in October, September, August, was Michael Cohen. So, let's look at what Mr. Davidson said in 2018 describing the negotiations with Mr. Cohen. He said:  As far as our conversations with Michael Cohen, it was solely about negotiating the deal, by completing a deal with two consenting adults the way that my client and his entity wanted. In October 2017, this recording, totally consistent with Mr. Cohen not telling President Trump about the Stormy Daniels payment until long after the fact. We can listen to this clip. It's quick."

    "text": "Now, Cohen uses the phrase, penny wise, pound foolish. Think about what that means. It's actually pretty telling of Mr. Cohen's state of mind at that time, which was October of 2017. The phrase is, basically, a warning about not making decisions relating to really small amounts of money in the near-term because the long-term could make you look foolish because it could turn out to be very valuable. So, it made perfect sense to Mr. Cohen in October of 2016 to make the payment without telling President Trump about it, in the hope that he could either get a new fancy job if President Trump won, or even a better job, potentially, within The Trump Organization or elsewhere if President Trump lost. Now, Mr. Cohen also told you during that recording that the amount of money was not that significant. It was $130,000. He told you during testimony something very different. He said it was a lot of money and he wouldn't have made the payment without assurance from President Trump that he would be reimbursed. Of course Mr. Cohen told you that he had multiple multi-million dollar apartments, and he made millions and millions of dollars in the years leading up to 2017 and also in 2017 and after as well. So, the idea that he would have never done, never made this $130,000 payment without getting approval from President Trump is something you should question and ask yourselves what proof there is, again, beyond his words of that happening. And remember what Mr. Cohen said on the recording? He said, what about me? What about me? That rings true from the testimony you heard from that man over the course of several days. So, also remember the call that Mr. Davidson told you about. So, Mr. Davidson told you about a call after the election in December of 2016. On December 9, 2016, Mr. Cohen called Davidson, apparently on Signal, to complain about not getting a job in the administration. Now, he told you that he didn't want a job in the administration, but that was a lie, another lie. He claimed that he didn't remember this call that Mr. Davidson told you about. But Mr. Davidson was clear about his memory of this call. Mr. Cohen -- he said that Mr. Cohen told him that he was in consideration to be the Attorney General of the United States or possibly the Chief of Staff, and that he was very upset that it didn't happen. So, this -- let's go back to that. Think about what happened in October of 2017 when Mr. Cohen said on that recording what you heard a minute ago, what about me? Mr. Cohen had an axe to grind because he didn't appreciate what President Trump did and did not do for him after President Trump became President of the United States. Let's listen to just a little bit more of that recording if we can."

    "text": "So, what's going on here? This is October 2017. By this time, there is no doubt, there is no doubt that President Trump knew that Michael Cohen had made this payment. By late 2017, Cohen had been called to testify before Congress, as you recall, regarding, amongst other things, these issues. And at the beginning of the recording, you actually hear Mr. Cohen talk about how he had referred Mr. Davidson to one of President Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow. So, of course, they discussed the payment, of course they did, but that doesn't change the lack of evidence about what President Trump knew in 2016. The evidence of that is from one man, Michael Cohen. Remember, Mr. Costello testified last week. He told you exactly the same thing. He told you that when he first met with Mr. Cohen again in 2018, in April, Mr. Cohen told him that President Trump did not know about the payments when they were made in 2016. And remember when this happened in Michael Cohen's life, okay. Federal agents had searched his house, searched his hotel room, searched his safe deposit box. He was under extreme stress. Mr. Costello said he mentioned suicide at the time; and Costello told Mr. Cohen the best way out of the situation, the best way for him not to be under stress was to provide information to the Feds. And Mr. Costello explained to him that that was the way that he could get leniency and not go to jail. In that environment, when Mr. Cohen was under all of that stress, facing the biggest crisis of his life, he said to Mr. Costello, President Trump did not know. So, briefly, on Mr. Costello, it's just another example of Mr. Cohen taking the witness stand and lying to you. He told you that he never engaged Mr. Costello and didn't consider Mr. Costello his attorney. He told you that Mr. Costello seemed sketchy and that he didn't trust him. He told you that Mr. Costello brought a Retainer Agreement to that April 17th meeting. You know that that's not true. There was no Engagement Letter until at least three or four days later. And he told you he spoke to Mr. Costello around 10 times. You know it was over 70. Each of those things he said to you about what happened between him and Mr. Costello was a lie. And I don't know how many lies are enough lies to just reject Mr. Cohen's testimony, big or small, meaningful or unmeaningful, but that was a lie. You know that there was an attorney-client relationship between Bob Costello and Michael Cohen, there is no doubt about that, and so does Mr. Cohen. Now, I want to talk for a few minutes about the Agreement itself. There is no dispute that President Trump never signed the Agreement. He never signed the side letter. And the Government wants you to believe that Mr. Cohen and the President discussed this Agreement on multiple occasions because Ms. Daniels, at the time, was this massive threat to the campaign. They want you to believe that President Trump thought that this could cost him the election, but, yet, he never signed the Agreement. So, if that were the case, how would that Agreement be enforced? So, remember the testimony about that? Mr. Cohen tried to tell you that the whole purpose of the Non-Disclosure Agreement was to ensure that the Trump name was not disclosed, so that Donald J. Trump was never part of this Agreement, but that was not true. That's not the reason that President Trump did not sign it, and that's not the reason I believe Mr. Cohen signed it. And the reason why you know that is, is because Mr. Cohen wrote -- wrote -- he actually wrote President Trump's name into the side letter. So, it is Mr. Cohen himself, and only Mr. Cohen, who attached President Trump's name to the transaction, not President Trump. So, the fact of the matter is, as it relates to Ms. Daniels and what President Trump knew in 2016, you only know from one source, and I said that a few times, but it matters, and that's Michael Cohen. So, what do they do? The Government knows that. They know who they are calling and what they are going to say. They prepped the witnesses, and there is nothing wrong with that. So, what did they do to try to prop Michael Cohen up, to try to prop his testimony up? They showed him phone records, and they showed him calls between him and others to help his testimony seem more corroborative and more credible. But, we all know how that happened, how that ended. You remember when we went through the calls from October 24th, 2016? He testified, both on direct and to me, that the purpose of that call was to update President Trump about the Daniels situation. This is two days before the Agreement is signed. This is right at the most key part of the negotiation, when Mr. Cohen is going to go -- he is going to open up an account. He is going to get the LLC, and he is going to fund it with his HELOC. It's all happening. And so, of course, as I told you guys, I updated President Trump every step of the way. And on October 24th at eight o'clock, it looks like it's Mr. Schiller, yes, because he was the bodyguard. I would call Mr. Schiller. That is what he told you. That was his sworn testimony. It was a lie. And this isn't a lie about whether he had an engagement relationship with Mr. Costello. This isn't a little lie about whether he -- what he thought about President Trump back them, or what his motivation was. This was a lie about the charged conduct involving Ms. Daniels. He told you he talked to President Trump on October 24th at 8:02 p.m., updating him about the Daniels' situation. That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed. We all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days, and he forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that. And you know that not only from the call logs and what happened, but the fact that the second they hung up that 90-second call, Mr. Cohen texted Mr. Schiller the number of the 14-year-old. And the very next text to Mr. Schiller the next morning was asking for a follow-up. That is perjury. Now, what did the Government do in response to that? On redirect, they showed you a picture with the unremarkable fact that everybody already knew that President Trump's bodyguard was with him on October 24th. No kidding. Thanks. They are perfectly happy to have a witness come in here and commit perjury, to lie to you."

Now, we happened to catch him in a lie. The People showed Mr. Cohen a series of text messages with Mr. Schiller. You saw that. It's in evidence. Consequently, it does not include the text messages with Mr. Schiller and Mr. Cohen involving the 14-year-old. They didn't show you that. We put that into evidence, and now you know what happened. Is there the same absolute proof of lies for every single thing that man told you? No. He knows there is not. For that, we have what's called an oath. We have an oath that every witness takes when they testify in front of you, the jury, and it matters. The oath matters the most. He lied. Now, there was another time when he lied to you. The Government showed Mr. Cohen a text message from the President's wife. It said:  Please call the President. And as the People know, there is no call from Mr. Cohen from his cell phone to President Trump right afterwards. But Mr. Cohen told you that he believed he placed the call from his landline. Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Mr. Cohen's landline is in evidence. You can look at it. His number at The Trump Organization where he said he was working that day was 212-836-3212. He told you that on direct. The records from that line are in evidence at this time."

And, if there is anything that we've learned during this trial, it is that Michael Cohen does not take that oath seriously. Period. He has repeatedly, repeatedly lied under oath. He has lied to his family. He lied to his wife about the $131,000 home equity line of credit. He said that he lied to his kids about that as well. He lied to his banker. He lied -- if you believe what he says about, at least what his story on the stand was, he lied to the FEC. He lied to every single reporter he talked to for about a year about what happened. I mean, he's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly. He has lied to Congress. He lied to Prosecutors. He lied to his family, his business associates. He lied to his bosses. He lies to reporters. He lies to Federal Judges. In fact, he is also a thief. He, literally, stole on his way out the door. He stole tens of thousands of dollars from The Trump Organization; and he admitted that on the stand. He admitted to committing a felony on the stand. Never prosecuted for that. Now, that's all fine, but what should matter to you, in addition to the lies in his past under oath, to his family, to the people that matter, what should matter to you is the lies that he said when he took an oath two weeks ago and gave testimony to you guys. That's what matters here. Sure, a past lie can be explained: Oh, it was loyalty to Donald Trump. Oh, it was to protect my family. Oh, at that point, I was still under the Trump cult. Fine. Fine. He lied under oath. But, when you come in here and you take an oath like he did -- (indicating with a pointed finger to the witness stand) -- that matters. It has to matter. And he lied to you. Make no mistake about it. Now, I said this in the beginning, Mr. Cohen admitted it on the stand, he has been obsessed with President Trump for over two decades. He told you that. He wrote it in his book. And until the Summer of 2018, he was a fan. And now he's not. He went from loving President Trump and defending him to outright hatred. I'm going to play an audio that I played when he was on the stand about what he really thinks. Go ahead."

    "text": "Now, Michael Cohen tells you that he has lied for Donald Trump. He has told you that he has lied to protect his family, and for other reasons. But, you know that he is lying simply to benefit and protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period. I'm almost done. Before I sit down -- I know I have been talking awhile -- but I want to talk about ten reasons, ten reasons why you have reasonable doubt. I will be quick. Each one of these reasons is a repeat of what I've already said today, but each one of these reasons makes a not guilty verdict a very easy path and a very quick path. The first one that I'm going to talk about that gives you reasonable doubt -- we talked about this a few hours ago -- are the invoices. The first reason that you should have real reasonable doubt is that Cohen created those invoices. Cohen created those invoices. They are accurate. And President Trump did not have any intent to defraud. There is no evidence of that. There is no evidence that President Trump knew that these invoices were sent. None of them were addressed to him. He was in Washington, D.C. the entire time. There is no proof beyond a reasonable doubt, based upon the fact that sometimes, sometimes President Trump looked at the invoices and what was behind the checks. That's just a guess. And it's reasonable doubt. The second is the Valentine's Day 2017 communication that was talked about, the vouchers and the checks. There is no proof that President Trump ever, ever saw anything that Ms. Tarasoff or Mr. McConney did with the vouchers and with the checks. He signed checks as President. Two of the checks he never even saw. He didn't even sign them. And the others he signed when he was at the White House, running the country in 2017. The third, there is absolutely no evidence of any intent to defraud. There was a 1099 issued. President Trump tweeted exactly what happened when it came out. And he submitted what happened to the Office of Government Ethics when he was President of the United States. That's not evidence of any intent to defraud. Similarly, there is absolutely no intent to unlawfully influence the 2016 election. Now, I expect that with this charge, with this part of the case, the Government is going to have to prove that there was a conspiracy. Remember, not just a conspiracy to promote a candidate. That happens in every election. There has to be a conspiracy that involved unlawful means, so something unlawful. And I believe that the Government is going to talk about three potential unlawful means that they will claim makes this conspiracy a crime. The first is the Federal Election Campaign Act, FECA. Now, you have to willfully -- I expect you will learn that you have to willfully violate FECA. There is no evidence, none, no evidence of a willful violation of FECA. Now, you are going to hear about the second view that they have, which is the violation of the tax laws. Now, the evidence of this is from Mr. Cohen, who we talked about a few -- a little bit ago. He said that Mr. Weisselberg said:  We are going to gross it up. He had no idea what it meant, and neither did Mr. McConney or Mr. Weisselberg, who supposedly said that to him. That's the tax fraud evidence. There is no evidence that there was anything improper about the way that these taxes were handled by President Trump, by The Trump Organization, or by Michael Cohen. None. And the last one is the falsifying of business records. Now, the bottom line is, as we talked about at length, there is no falsification of business records. Period. And any argument to the contrary by the People is wrong. I expect they are going to talk to you about other documents besides the counts that President Trump is charged with, like the LLCs that Mr. Cohen created along the way; bank records with Mr. Davidson; but there is no evidence at all, not even a little bit of evidence that President Trump knew anything about any of those false filings. None. Remember that invoice from Investor Advisor Services that was sent from AMI to Mr. Cohen for the $150,000 payment? It's People's Exhibit 103. Even Mr. Pecker said he hadn't seen that until the investigation started. Again, no evidence President Trump had anything to do with that. There is also number five. There is no evidence of any illegal effort to influence the 2016 election. And I just went through all that. I'm not going to go through it again. But, just remember, for you to believe this happened, you have to believe that at this August 2015 meeting, there was a conspiracy formed, an illegal conspiracy to criminally influence the election."

    "text": "Now, Mr. Weisselberg was not at that meeting. You know that. Nobody suggested otherwise. There is no evidence that he ever talked to anyone about trying to promote President Trump's campaign. So, again, even if you do believe that Mr. Weisselberg had something to do with the payments that are ultimately at issue in this case, there is no evidence he had anything to do with whatever agreement was reached to try to influence the election. Another reason there is reasonable doubt. AMI would have run -- would have run Mr. Sajudin's story no matter what. That's not catch-and-kill. Another reason. McDougal did not want her story published. She wanted to be on the covers of magazines. And guess what? It worked! She was successful. She did not want her story published. That's not catch-and-kill. And with the Ms. Daniels story, again, the story was already public. The story was already public. Now, the ninth one -- the ninth reason that you should have reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is the manipulation of evidence. Now, there are a lot of documents and a lot of records that you have seen in this case. And those documents, those records, that testimony, Mr. Steinglass is going to talk to you about this afternoon, about why the Government believes that they proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But, they have made mistakes in this trial in the way that they presented the evidence."

    "text": "And we have caught them. First, there is the text message that I talked about a few minutes ago from President Trump's wife to Michael Cohen, saying \"call me\" and no evidence of a phone call. Second, the October 24th, 8:02 phone call. Again, those text messages were not shown to you by the Government; they were shown to you by us on cross-examination. And, third, Mr. Cohen's phone. Do you remember a few weeks ago, when a representative from the District Attorney's Office named Douglas Daus testified about how he had searched Mr. Cohen's two phones?  CP1 was one of the phones. But, what did they not tell you until cross? He didn't tell you that Mr. Cohen had actually wiped his phone on October 15th of 2016. That's about five or six weeks after this recording was supposedly made. Mr. Daus did not tell you that Mr. Cohen actually synced the phone with his computer, with his laptop, on January 25th, 2017. And you haven't seen any evidence that the laptop was ever searched. Mr. Daus did not tell you that Mr. Cohen synced the phone again in October of 2020. He said that on cross. And, by the way, we don't even know -- we don't have any information about what device was actually used for that sync. But, we do know -- we do know that that September 6th recording, that was part of that sync. Mr. Daus told you that when he was asked. So, with this wiping and this syncing of Mr. Cohen's phones and everything else that you know about Mr. Cohen, how can you trust that the September 6th recording is actually reliable? The answer is, you can't. You have to rely on Mr. Cohen again. Now, Mr. Cohen lied about that. I said that already. He testified that he used the same phone, and he said he used the same phone to make the recording and to answer the phone call. He said he was positive about that. He even told you the story about the Capital One woman that he spoke with when he answered the call. But, the phone records tell a different story. The phone records provided very specific evidence relating to the device that received that call. And I know this goes back a few weeks, but the IMEI number, it's almost like the serial number for a phone. Mr. Dixon told you that, from AT&T. And you can see it from the phone records, that the device that received the calls that the Government showed Mr. Cohen had an IMEI ending in 174913. And you heard from another phone witness that the IMEI on Cohen's phone, CP1, ended in 997431. It's a different phone. Cohen made up that call. He made up how it was received. And there is nothing you can trust about anything he said to you about what happened with that recording. And the last thing I'm going to talk about that gives you reasonable doubt is what I have been talking about for the past several hours:  Michael Cohen. He's the human embodiment of reasonable doubt. Literally. He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depends on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true. The kind of witness that you want to testify -- to take an oath and testify is somebody that you can trust that they are telling you something to the best of their recollection. Period. That's what we want from all of our witnesses. Most of the witnesses that testified over the past five weeks, I think you got that. Most of them. But, with Michael Cohen, you did not. So, there is something -- do you guys -- have you guys heard of a GOAT; like the GOAT, the Greatest Of All Time? It's like what people talk about with athletes like Michael Jordan as the GOAT; Tiger Woods as the GOAT; Tom Brady as the GOAT. These athletes are the \"Greatest of All Time,\" the best among their peers. Michael Cohen is the GLOAT. He's, literally, the Greatest Liar of All Time! He has lied to every single branch of Congress, both Houses, the House and the Senate. He has lied to the Department of Justice when he met with the Special Counsel's Office. He has lied to Federal Judges on multiple occasions. He has lied to State Judges. He has lied to his family. He has lied to his bankers. He has lied to the people he works with. He stole from President Trump. His words cannot be trusted. And I'm going to end this summation the same way, the same way that I told you a few minutes ago that you know you cannot rely on him, which is that all those lies, lies under oath, lies to his family, lies when it matters, lies when it doesn't matter, all those lies, put them to the side for just a moment. That's, alone, enough to walk away. But then he came in here, he raised his right hand, and he lied to each of you, repeatedly; repeatedly. You cannot -- you cannot send somebody to prison, you cannot convict somebody --"

That's not what this is about. The verdict that you are going to reach has to do with the evidence you heard here in this courtroom, and nothing else. Nothing else that you knew or thought about President Trump or about any of the other folks that testified, but just the evidence that you heard from the witnesses, the recordings and the documents.

There is no requirement of prison. Punishment is something that's explicitly -- that the jurors are told not to consider. And that was a blatant and wholly inappropriate effort to cull sympathy for their client. So, we would like a curative instruction before the summations start. Second of all, we would like -- the Defense has used your ruling as a sword instead of a shield, in terms of not giving the limiting instruction on Retainer Agreements. They have now doubled down and somehow suggested, once again, as they did with the testimony, that it's perfectly plausible to not have a Retainer Agreement, when that is not the law in New York State. For all of the reasons we argued earlier, but also for the new reason that they have now doubled down on it and, again, misled the jury, I think your Honor should reconsider your decision and give the curative instruction that we provided.

Indeed, the cases cited, one of the main cases cited was a State that was suing to not have to pay the full amount to a lawyer, and the issue was whether or not there was an attorney-client privilege rather than whether or not the retainer was valid. That was not the issue. More significantly, 100-years-plus of legal experience testified, and there wasn't a single question other than on cross-examination about the -- when they testified about it on cross that:  Hey, retainer agreements can be oral, they don't have to be in writing; and then the same for Mr. Costello when he testified on direct. But there wasn't a single question on cross by the People questioning him about that. So, you have -- and that's because it's true. That's because it's true:  You do not need a Retainer Agreement in writing. Potentially, to get paid you do. To get paid, you do. And that's certainly the law. But there is another exception to that law, which clearly applies to Mr. Cohen, if you are continuing in the same role and job that you've had prior to entering into a no-Retainer-Agreement-in-writing relationship. Mr. Cohen himself testified on direct, cross, and redirect that his job was exactly the same in 2017 that it was in 2016."

    "text": "Thank you. Your Honor, counsel, members of the jury, good afternoon. In his opening, Mr. Colangelo told you that this case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a coverup; a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 election, and a coverup, an effort to hide that conspiracy by falsifying business records to disguise the payment to Stormy Daniels to buy her silence. In order to prove the defendant's guilt in this matter, we have to prove three basic things: Number one, that there were, in fact, false business records in this case; Number two, that the false business records were intended to cover up a conspiracy to promote or prevent the election of a candidate by unlawful means; And, three, that the defendant himself was involved, that he made or caused the false business records and that he had the intent to defraud. We asked you in the opening to focus on the facts, and the logical inferences that flow from those facts, to examine not just the testimony, but also the hard evidence in this case:  The invoices, recordings, the emails, the texts, the handwritten notes, the bank records. We asked you to remember to tune out the noise and to ignore the sideshows. And if you had done that, when you discuss this case with your fellow jurors, you will see that the People have presented powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt. Before we get to what this case is not about, let's just talk briefly -- before we get to what this case is about, let's talk briefly about what this case is not about:  Some of those sideshows that I just mentioned. Now, the Defense seems to be questioning our integrity in making certain exhibits in this case, such as the call summary charts or exhibits that contain certain texts, but not others. And don't fall for the suggestion that these call summaries were trimmed down to somehow mislead you. The call summaries are intended as a guide for you to look at some of the relevant calls in the New York time zone. But the calls themselves, the phone records themselves are all in evidence, and so you can look through them at your leisure if you so choose. The Defense also can point you to any call that they want you to look at; and, in fact, they did so. So, there is nothing sinister here, no manipulation. And that's an interesting accusation coming from the Defense, who created a phone summary of calls between Mr. Costello and Mr. Cohen and double counted half the calls. I mean, you have to go back and look at that. Look at how many calls were actually made to the two of them. They count the landline calls that may have been with Cohen's friend, Mr. Citron. So that's -- you should keep that in mind when you are analyzing that evidence. And, nor should you accept the Defense's argument that we somehow hid evidence by selecting texts to create exhibits. The Defense was provided with the entire forensic image of both of Mr. Cohen's phones. They were free to and did create their own exhibits to make whatever points they felt like making. And keep something else in mind -- and this is quite important when you are looking at the phone records and summary charts -- not every call is reflected in those exhibits, not by a long shot. I will give you an example: There are eleven unique phone numbers, phone contacts in Cohen's -- just one of Cohen's phones for the Defendant. Eleven different phone numbers. We only have phone records for two of those numbers. We don't have his landline -- we don't have his landline at work. We don't have his landline at home. And we certainly don't have his office line from the White House. We also don't have the outgoing calls from Mr. Cohen's landlines, despite what Mr. Blanche told you just now, a few minutes ago. There are no outgoing calls from that number. One of the phone company representatives told you that they only keep those types of records for three years, and we are fortunate to have what we have. So, a phone record proves that a particular call happened, but the absence of a phone record doesn't prove that a particular call did not happen. Also, keep in mind that aside from a few screenshots from Cohen's phone from the Signal app, there are no records at all about encrypted phone calls between the conspirators in this case. That's the whole point of using an encrypted app, is so that there isn't a record. Finally, some of the conversations in this case took place in person, so there wouldn't be a phone call record of that. The point here is that the fact that there isn't a record of a particular phone call does not mean that a particular conversation did not take place. Fortunately, there are plenty of phone records that actually are in evidence. And that's in evidence as People's 400. You can examine them, and you will see that there are -- many of the calls that we talk about in this case are, in fact, proven in the phone records. So, another reoccurring Defense narrative is this notion that Stormy Daniels was trying to extort the Defendant, threatened to go public unless she was paid off; but, that's just not reality. You've got to go beneath the surface here. Look at the evidence. Look at the texts. Look at the timing. And we are going to do all that. But, for now, suffice it to say that, for example, the tape that Mr. Blanche played on -- in the middle of his summation of a recording where Keith Davidson is talking about somebody coming forward and saying that this was all about the election, at the time of the election we're going to lose our leverage, that wasn't Stormy Daniels. That was her boyfriend, her ex-boyfriend, Anthony Kotsev, who Davidson was speculating might come out and say those things. It's all in Davidson's testimony. That's just what Mr. Blanche suggested that Stormy Daniels was threatening to do that -- it's just not the evidence, and it's not the testimony. Daniels' first goal was to get the story on record because she believed that that was the best way to protect herself and her family. Do you remember, she told you that she had a conversation with a friend of hers who is a lawyer, and he said to her:  \"You got to get out, get out in front of this. Hide in plain view.\" Now, I'm not suggesting that choosing between telling the story and getting paid versus telling the story and not getting paid, she would rather tell the story and get paid, but that's a different thing. From this extortion narrative that the Defense is selling, keep in mind something; Rodriguez reached out to Howard first; right. Howard is the Chief Content Officer at AMI. She didn't reach out to Cohen. There is no evidence that she ever spoke to Cohen. Here, Howard tells Davidson, who doesn't even appear to know that Keith Davidson is trying to hawk the Stormy Daniels story to the media, and Rodriguez is reaching out to Dylan Howard to get the National Enquirer to sell the story to the press, not the candidate. Similarly, after the Daniels story resurfaced, Cohen reached out to Davidson first. Not the other way around. They got wind of the fact that this story was around, and they wanted to buy it before Stormy Daniels could go public with it. Now, think what you want about Mr. Davidson and this whole practice of trading on stories of sexual relationships with celebrities or politicians. Maybe you think it's a sordid practice. Maybe you think that it's a way for women who have been taking advantage of to get something out of it. In the end, it doesn't really matter, because you don't get to commit election fraud or falsify your business records because you believe you have been victimized. In other words, extortion is not a defense to falsifying business records. And, if you have any questions about this, you can ask the Judge. Now, the Defense has also attempted to discredit the witnesses in this case, not just Mr. Cohen. And no judgments. That's their job. But, you've got to use your common sense here. Consider the utterly damming testimony of David Pecker, the defendant's friend for four decades. Mr. Blanche said in his summation that Mr. Pecker was speaking from experience and that that matters. That's important. That's an odd thing to say, because -- for them, because if you accept Mr. Pecker's testimony, it alone establishes one of the three things that we have to prove here, that the conspiracy to unlawfully influence the 2016 election, you don't need Michael Cohen to prove that one bit. Pecker also eliminates the whole notion that this was just politics as usual. And so, when you consider his testimony, don't just focus on -- the Defense did this a lot. They took one question kind of out of context and put that up on the screen. But it's in the middle of a whole series of questions. And you will see that. We will try to put some of those things in their context -- in their proper context. So, when you are considering Mr. Pecker's testimony, consider it as a whole. Don't consider the two questions that they displayed during their summation. Keep in mind that Mr. Pecker has absolutely no reason to lie here. He has no bias against the Defendant. He still considers Mr. Trump a friend and mentor; and, yet, his testimony is utterly devastating. The same thing he said of several of the witnesses here. They offered testimony that is damaging, but they have no motive to fabricate:  Hope Hicks, Rhona Graff, Madeleine Westerhout, Jeff McConney, Deb Tarasoff. These people like the Defendant. If anything, they have an incentive to skew their testimony in a way that would help the Defendant. Yet, each of them provides critical pieces of the puzzle, building blocks that help establish the Defendant's guilt. Now, to be sure, other witnesses want to see the Defendant held accountable. They are angry with the Defendant and, frankly, want to see him convicted. They have been attacked by the Defendant on social media and, as a result, they have incurred the wrath of his most fiery supporters. The Defense has gone to great lengths to discredit Stormy Daniels and her account of her sexual involvement with Mr. Trump. They shamed her. They have tried to suggest that her story has changed over the years. It has not. At least not in any way that's significant. Her false denials have been thoroughly discussed and explained. And when she didn't actually -- she lived in 2017 in pure silence. She was perfectly happy going along, but when Cohen came out and he started saying that the sex never happened, she felt compelled to go forward. She wanted to get her story out. They demonized her as someone who makes a living off of the Defendant. To be sure, there were parts of her testimony that were cringe-worthy, because that whole episode in the suite at Harrah's, that was uncomfortable. Some of the details about what the suite looked like and the contents of his toiletry bag and the topics of conversation in the dining area, those are the kind of details, though, that I submit to you, that kind of ring true. They are the kind of details that you would expect someone to remember. And if she didn't testify about those details, it would, undoubtedly, give the Defense more ammunition in their efforts to call her a liar, to argue that she was never in that hotel room. Fortunately, she was not asked, nor did she volunteer, many details about the sexual act itself. Now, in his opening that kind of sounded, again, like in his closing, Mr. Blanche told that you that Ms. Daniels' testimony doesn't matter. That's a bridge too far. Because it's certainly true that we don't have to prove that sex actually took place. That's not an element of the crimes charged. But, the Defendant knew what happened in that hotel room. And to the extent that you credit her testimony, that only reinforces his incentive to buy her silence. And the Defense knows that; because if her testimony were so irrelevant, why did they work so hard to try to discredit her? What I'm saying is that her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably made some of you uncomfortable to hear. But, that's kind of the point. That's the display the Defendant didn't want the American voter to see. In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive. And you can bet Mr. Trump would not pay $130,000, twice that after it was grossed up for taxes, just because he took a photograph with someone on a golf course. And that brings us to Michael Cohen. And we have been very clear about him from the moment jury selection began. I know it seems like a while ago. You remember, I was standing in the same spot. And I told you then that Cohen has baggage. He's a convicted felon. He has lied under oath. He has written books. He has done podcasts about the Defendant. And while he was still in the Trump camp, he openly denied and misled the press, the FEC and the SEC about some of the same things we heard here. And Mr. Colangelo told you the same thing. He told you about some of the mistakes that he made. And we all agree and still agree that those are factors that you should take into account when you are assessing his credibility. How could you not? Now, the Defense has argued that Cohen is biased, he's an interested witness because he wants to see the Defendant convicted. Badly. Guess what?  We agree with that. Cohen is an interested witness, and that's a factor that you should consider in assessing his credibility. But, listen to his Honor's instructions very carefully about this. You are not required to reject the testimony of an interested witness any more than you are required to accept the testimony of a witness with no interest. Michael Cohen is, understandably, angry that, to date, he's the only one who has paid the price for his role in this conspiracy. Pecker got a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Howard is in Australia. And the Defendant has, up until now, escaped justice. Cohen did the Defendant's bidding for years. He was the Defendant's right-hand man, his \"Consigliere,\" as one person put it in the texts. And when it went bad, the Defendant cut him loose, he dropped him like a hot potato and tweeted out to the world that Mr. Cohen was a scumbag -- a \"SleazeBag\", I think, is the word that he used. And, all the while, the Election Law Violations to which Cohen pled guilty were committed at the Defendant's direction and for his benefit."

    "text": "Anyone in Cohen's shoes would want the Defendant to be held accountable. So, the Defense urges you to reject Cohen's testimony because he was seeking a benefit when he spoke to members of our Office way back when. And, by the way, what Cohen testified to was that he spent hours in the Office, speaking to people in the Office, he told you however many times he met with the people in the Office, he testified that he did not and he has not met with District Attorney Bragg. What he said was -- what the Defense is saying is that, well, he asked us about giving him a letter in support of his many motions to try to get his sentence reduced or his supervised release reduced. And it's true, he did ask about that. But guess what?  He never got one. And he never got his sentence reduced either. And he is still here, providing information about what went down. And, also, if you remember that recorded conversation between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson that was admitted into evidence through Davidson, that's People's Exhibit 265 -- this is just the transcript of that call -- Cohen reveals that the Defendant tells him that he hates the fact that he did it, referring to the Daniels story. In other words, Mr. Cohen is saying that Mr. Trump hates the fact that we did it. And this is before his cooperation, before he had any conceivable motive to lie, before his guilty plea. I mean, he was still getting monthly checks at this point. And something else about this phone call that was very interesting. Mr. Blanche -- it sounded like he admitted it -- that at least as early as 2017, the Defendant knew of the Stormy Daniels payments. And, remember, 2017 is when the checks were still rolling in every month. Of course, the Defendant knew much earlier than 2017. And we will get to why in a moment, but I just wanted to point that out to you. So, the next reason they tell you to reject Mr. Cohen's testimony is that he stole from The Trump Organization. So, I will call it \"The TO\" sometimes. And when he and Allen Weisselberg were working out the reimbursement for the Stormy Daniels payoff, you remember, there was an outstanding bill for $50,000 to Red Finch, and that bill was because Mr. Trump had asked Cohen to help rig some online poll, some CNBC poll to make the Defendant seem more popular than he really was as a businessman; but, eventually, CNBC kind of pulled that poll, and so Mr. Trump decided, like he often does: I'm not going to pay this bill. And Mr. Cohen laid out $20,000 cash from his own funds. And it's true that Allen Weisselberg knew, of course, that this $50,000 was out there; Mr. Trump knew. And when Weisselberg said, okay, write down everything that we owe you, Trump -- Cohen did not correct him and say, well, you know, it's only $20,000 that I laid out. And he should have. And that's stealing. And we agree. And he was raw about the fact that the Defendant had cut his bonus in 2016 by two-thirds after he had gone to some great lengths for the Defendant that year. And Mr. Cohen -- that didn't come out on cross-examination. Mr. Cohen admitted that readily during direct examination. And it's true that he was the one -- that he was never charged with that theft. He's also the one who brought it to everyone's attention. He raised it. He said, by the way, I didn't really get $50,000. He volunteered it. And what he did say was that after doing three years or at least getting sentenced to three years, plus three years of post release supervision, that he paid his price for his role in this scheme. But, in any event, none of this matters because it's not a defense to the false business records charge that one of the conspirators is also guilty of stealing from another. And, I will tell you something else that was kind of funny. I don't know if somebody caught this during summation. Mr. Blanche said, well, he stole $60,000, right, because it was grossed up. But -- so, that he means that the Defense is trying to have it both ways, right. They are denying that the 420,000 was a reimbursement at all. They are claiming it was payment for legal services rendered in 2017. We will get to why that's ridiculous later. But, if that's true, then there was no theft; right?  He's not getting paid back for Red Finch, he's getting paid for legal services in 2017. So, they can call him a thief or claim this wasn't really a reimbursement, but not both. And, of course, you know from the documents, which we will look at later, that these payments were, indeed, a reimbursement. Now, the Defense has urged you to reject Mr. Cohen's testimony because he has made and is still making money from talking about many of the things that this case involves, his books and his podcasts. And that's also true. We agree with that. And he even sells merchandise relating to his desire to see the Defendant convicted. I think Mr. Blanche put up a slide about that. None of that is a crime. And I suspect that he will continue to do that, regardless of the outcome of this trial. He has been convicted of multiple felonies. He has had to sell his real estate. He can't get a new bank loan or a mortgage. He's not allowed to own taxi medallions anymore. He has been disbarred. Plus, he has huge fines and legal bills to pay. Not to mention the steady stream of online attacks from the Defendant and threats from his supporters. I'm not asking you to feel bad for Michael Cohen. He made his bed. But, you can hardly blame him for making money from the one thing that he has left, which is his knowledge of the inner workings of the Trump phenomenon. The Defense tells that you Cohen has an axe to grind. He is mad at the Defendant at the end of 2016 for three reasons: One, because the Defendant cut his bonus. Two, because the Defendant hadn't paid him back yet, the $130,000. Although, that also doesn't seem to work; that that would mean that the Defendant knew about the 130,000. So, again, their arguments are not necessarily consistent, but they are passionate. And, three, because the Defendant didn't give him a top Government position. Again, they are right about the first two. Cohen complained to Pecker, Davidson, Weisselberg, and that's why Weisselberg and Trump made it right. They upped his bonus, although not fully. They arranged to pay him back the $130,000. And Trump gave him the position that he really wanted, a title he could monetize into a $4 million payday. That all happened in the days before the inauguration in 2017. And Cohen was perfectly happy with that arrangement. Happy enough to demonstrate his loyalty by keeping the parties to these NDAs in line for another 15 months. The Defense also tells you that you should reject his -- Cohen's testimony because he said that he lied when he took his pleas in Federal Court. And, I think the truth is that he has had some difficulty accepting responsibility about some of that conduct. Not -- not the Federal Campaign Finance Violations. He has been very consistent about that. But, you know, for his Bank Fraud conviction, and his -- his Tax Law Violation, he said, he -- he admitted to you that he did the things that they said that he did; right. He pled guilty. He acknowledged that there was information missing from his Tax Form and his HELOC application. But he feels like he was treated unfairly. That's what he told you. He feels like as a first offender, he should have been given a chance to pay the fines and his back taxes. And he thinks that other people in his shoes would have been given the chance to do so. He believes that the Trump Justice Department did him dirty. Whether that's true or not, he was very forthright about the conduct that he committed, and he accepted responsibility for it. And he went to prison for it, along with the Campaign Finance Violations. So, you should consider all of these things in assessing his credibility. But, just ask yourselves whether they cause you to outright shut your ears to anything else that he has to say? One of the things that Defense accuses him of doing is lying to Congress. And that's kind of rich. Because the lies that he told to Congress in 2017 had to do with the Mueller Investigation, and it had to do with the investigation into the Russia probe. And what Michael Cohen lied about was the number of dealings that the Defendant had with Russia. And he got no benefit for that, other than staying in the Defendant's good graces as part of a Joint Defense Agreement. And so, now those lies that he told are being used by that same Defendant to undermine his credibility. That's what some people might call chutzpah. And that brings us to the phone call on October 24th at 8:02 p.m. in which Cohen testified that he called to speak with Mr. Trump. And it turns out that, at first, he was speaking to Mr. Schiller about getting harassing calls. And, of course, the Defense says:  Aha, that's perjury. That's -- the only interpretation of that is that he's lying. That's the only interpretation that they want you to consider. To them, that is the big lie. But that's not the only interpretation. Cohen clearly did not remember the initial reason for the call. And when he saw the text with Mr. Schiller, he acknowledged that he had also spoken with Schiller on that call. And we know from People's Exhibit 417B and the stipulations of the parties -- this is People's 417B -- that the Defendant and Mr. Schiller were together, getting off the stage at a rally in Tampa at 7:57 p.m., five minutes before the phone call."

    "text": "But even if you're not convinced that both conversations happened in that call, a far less sinister explanation is that Cohen could have just gotten the date and the time of that particular conversation wrong. Despite what Mr. Blanche said, this was not any critical moment in time. This was one update of many. I believe, Mr. Cohen testified that he spoke to the Defendant maybe 20 times, giving him updates on this case, in the month of October. This was not the final go-ahead. This will come two days later, on October 26th. And we'll get back to that. Because that was right before Cohen walked over to the bank. Think about this logically. You know you had a conversation around a particular time. You see a call record in that window. And it's a natural assumption that the conversation happened during that call. But, you still remember that you updated the Defendant regularly. Let me give you an example. Let's say that you had dinner at a restaurant a few years ago with an old friend, and at that dinner, your friend told you that he was getting married. And you find the receipt a couple of years later from that restaurant, and you're like: Oh, yeah, that must have been the date such and such told me he was getting married. But, as it turns out, your friend was in California that weekend, so it turns out you must be wrong, and it must have been some other night you had dinner with your friend and he told you he's getting married. That doesn't mean you're lying that you had dinner with your friend or that he told you he was getting married. Cohen may be able to place a particular call by looking at the phone records, the texts, the time, for context about what was going on around that time; but the story is, as he told you, the same story that he's been telling for six years. And here, too, the Defense is trying to have it both ways. They're telling you that Cohen will say anything to get the Defendant convicted. And then they're pointing out that his testimony, if you accept it, isn't enough. So, which is it? It's actually neither. Because they're wrong on both accounts. If it is his purpose -- if Cohen's purpose were to come in here to lie, how easy would it have been for him to go further, to say that the Defendant admitted to sleeping with Karen McDougal or Stormy Daniels? In fact -- I don't know if you remember this. It was a small point. But, Cohen testified that he flat-out asked Mr. Trump whether he slept with Ms. Daniels, and Mr. Trump didn't answer. He just said she was a beautiful woman. So, if Mr. Cohen wanted to lie for the Defendant, he could have easily said: The Defendant said, yeah, he slept with her, it was the greatest night of his life, whatever. But, that's not what he was doing. Cohen could have easily said he went over every line with every contract with these NDAs with Mr. Trump. But, instead, he said that he updated Mr. Trump when he locked these things down or when some major development happened. He didn't get into the nitty-gritty of what every contract said. Or, he could have said that he and the Defendant overtly discussed the facts that the NDAs in this case violated Federal Election Law. He could have said that the conversation with Allen Weisselberg and the Defendant, that in that conversation the Defendant said something like, \"Let's cook the books,\" or took a more active role in plotting out exactly how they were going to do this. Cohen didn't do any of that. Why? Because he's limited by what actually happened. That's what he's going to tell you, and he's not going to tell you anything beyond that. And the interesting thing is, is that the Defense wants to have it both ways here, too. Because whenever Cohen says anything that helps them, like he thought Stormy Daniels [sic] was being extorted -- or, Stormy Daniels was extorting the Defendant, they want you to believe that. They don't want you to believe anything that helps prove the case against their client. Michael Cohen was really more of the Defendant's fixer than his lawyer. He had a legal title, but he wasn't in The Trump Organization's Legal Department. He didn't answer to the General Counsel. He answered to the Defendant directly. He got the jobs no one else wanted, the jobs that the Defendant wanted to keep quiet. He was the buffer, the guy with the boots on the ground that could bully people and threaten them with lawsuits, all at the Defendant's direction. He was a way for the Defendant to maintain plausible deniability or, in this case, given the rest of the evidence, implausible deniability. Keep something else in mind when the Defense goes on and on about how Michael Cohen is immoral or he's a liar, he's a thief. Mr. Blanche actually said, \"This is not the type of witness you want.\" We didn't choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn't pick him up at the witness store. The Defendant chose Michael Cohen to be his fixer, because he was willing to lie and cheat on Mr. Trump's behalf. Mr. Trump chose Mr. Cohen for the same qualities that his attorneys now urge you to reject his testimony because of. This is a passage from Think Big, one of Mr. Trump's books: \"As a matter of fact, I value loyalty above everything else -- more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy.\" He says things like this again and again in his books. And at the time, Cohen had enough blind loyalty and enough moral flexibility to be a perfect choice for this role. Cohen was drawn to the Defendant like a moth to the flame. And he wasn't the only one. Think about David Pecker for a minute. Look what the Defendant did to David Pecker. Pecker saw Donald Trump as a mentor. Donald Trump saw David Pecker as a useful tool, a means to an end. That's why, if you remember, Mr. Pecker testified, suddenly, after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, contact between them increased dramatically. Mr. Trump not only corrupted those around him, but he got them to lie to cover it up: Stay on message or you're out. Remember, like Cohen, Pecker also issued a false denial after The Wall Street Journal broke the Karen McDougal story on November 4th. He falsely claimed that the deal was all about the context. And he admitted to you that he issued that denial for the same reason that he purchased Karen McDougal's story in the first place, to protect the campaign. The judge will tell you that Mr. Cohen is an accomplice because he participated in crimes based on conduct alleged in this case. And, under our law, the judge will explain to you that you cannot convict Mr. Cohen -- you cannot convict the Defendant on Mr. Cohen's word alone, unless it's corroborated by other evidence in this case, evidence that tends to connect the Defendant with the commission of this crime. That's not much of a hurdle because in this case there is, literally, a mountain of evidence of corroborating testimony that tends to connect the Defendant to this crime: from Pecker, to Hicks, to the Defendant's own employees, to the documents, to the Defendant's own Tweets, and rallies, and his own words on that recorded conversation. The list goes on and on. It's difficult to conceive of a case with more corroboration than this one. You don't need to waste any time thinking about this one. So, eventually, Cohen came to the realization that with Mr. Trump, loyalty was not a two-way street. And it became clear that attorney Robert Costello, the ostensible back channel to Mr. Trump, was actually a double agent, there to discourage Cohen from cooperating and to keep the Defendant informed. And it became clear to Cohen that they were setting him up to be the fall guy. And Michael Cohen came to his day of reckoning. He decided to put loyalty to his family above that blind loyalty that he had given the Defendant for the previous ten years. And he came clean. And when it comes to the facts of this case, he has been consistently describing the events that took place in this case for six years. In fact, he explained that when he testified in Congress in 2019. He apologized to the American people for lying and for suppressing information that the citizenry had a right to know before choosing their President. And as we discussed in jury selection, the question is not whether you like Cohen or whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case. And the truth is, that he was in the best position to know. He was in the best position to know because he was the Defendant's right hand. He was in the best position to know about the conspiracy to influence the election, and he was in the best position to know about the false business records that the Defendant created to hide that conspiracy. Listening to the Defense summation and to their opening, for that matter, it's patently obvious that they want to make this case about Michael Cohen. It isn't. That's a deflection. Like many of the Defendant's own Tweets. The Defense had Michael Cohen on cross-examination for three days and asked him maybe an hour's worth of questions that had anything to do with the allegations in this case, with the charges in this case. This case is not about Michael Cohen. This case is about Donald Trump and whether he should be held accountable for making or causing false entries in his own business records, whether he and his staff did that to cover up the Election Law violation. Michael Cohen's significance in this case is that he provides context and color to the documents, the phone records, the texts, the recordings. He's like a tour guide through the physical evidence. But, those documents don't lie. And they don't forget. And as much as the Defense wants to draw your attention away from these documents or to pick and choose the ones they want to show you and kind of cobble it together, although it appears in a narrative, those documents tell you everything you need to know. You don't need Michael Cohen to connect these dots. But, as the ultimate insider, he can help you to do just that. In order to really understand what was going on here, you do have to kind of roll up your sleeves a little and get into those documents. We've done this throughout the trial piece by piece, but it's easier when you put all of the evidence together into a timeline. You don't have to study this right now. This is just a foreshadowing of the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower, which is really the prism through which you should analyze the evidence in this case. Three rich and powerful men, high up in Trump Tower, trying to become even more powerful by controlling the flow of information that might reach the voters. Mr. Blanche made some allusions to this. Hope Hicks tells you she remembers seeing Mr. Pecker in Trump Tower and was not part of this conversation, even though she was in and out of meetings at all times. She said it's certainly possible she was in and out of a meeting with Mr. Pecker at some point. This makes perfect sense. This is not the kind of thing you want to discuss in front of your press secretary, especially your female press secretary."

    "text": "As Hicks told you in her own words, there were some things she just didn't want to know. As Mr. Pecker explained, the meeting began with Donald Trump and Michael Cohen asking what Pecker could do to help the campaign. And you can have his testimony read back, any part of it, all of it, his description of this meeting. He gave you a lot more detail about this meeting than Michael Cohen did, actually. During this Trump Tower meeting, they settled on three key components of the meeting: Number one. To accentuate the positive. To promote the campaign, but not by endorsing Mr. Trump or by printing puff pieces. By colluding directly with the campaign to manufacture favorable content. Far outside any of the normal, legitimate press function. Pecker and Howard actually sent articles to the campaign in advance so that Cohen could show them to Mr. Trump, and he could exercise veto power over certain topics or make certain changes in advance. The second component, as you know, was an agreement to publish stories attacking the Defendant's political opponents. Especially during the primaries. And these stories were timed for maximum impact, to drop just as those opponents were surging in the polls. The Defense asked Mr. Pecker on cross whether some of his stories were old or recycled from other publications. I think he made the same argument in his summation. Either way, Pecker told you the stories were reprinted at exactly the right time for the purpose of helping the Defendant's campaign. Now, that is also not a normal, legitimate press function. And despite what Mr. Blanche suggested to you in his summation, these stories were not just consumed by National Enquirer's 350,000 subscribers. The National Enquirer is seen by everyone who ever waited on a supermarket checkout line or who shopped at Walmart. Remember, Mr. Pecker said the only thing that matters is the cover. But, the real game changer of this meeting was the catch and kill component. And that's the illegal part, because once money starts changing hands on behalf of the campaign, that's Election Law -- that's Federal Election Campaign Finance violations. We'll get back to that. Now, Mr. Blanche said in his summation that they didn't discuss catch and kill. Now, that's not true. They discussed catch and contain. They didn't use the term \"catch and kill\", but that's exactly what it was. Pecker explained he would be the eyes and ears of the campaign. AMI was a publishing powerhouse with dozens of publications and a vast network of sources. All three men knew and explicitly discussed the fact that women would be coming forward with accounts of sexual liaisons they had with Mr. Trump. Trump, himself, told Pecker and Cohen to work together: If something comes up, Pecker, you call Cohen. Cohen, you take care of it. I want this to be handled. So, as Mr. Pecker testified, Pecker would notify Cohen, the Defendant's fixer, whenever AMI learned of such a story, so that the story could be purchased and suppressed. That is the definition of \"catch and kill\", whether you use the phrase or not. This is not, as Mr. Blanche suggested, like buying a story that you may or may not decide to print as you investigate it. This is buying the story that you do not intend to print so that no one else can print it. That's \"catch and kill\". In his opening, Mr. Blanche said, and I quote: \"There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\" In reality, this agreement at Trump Tower was the exact opposite. It was the subversion of democracy. Democracy gives the people the right to elect their leaders, but that rests on the fundamental premise that the voters have access to accurate information about the candidates. The entire purpose of this meeting at Trump Tower was to deny that access, to manipulate and defraud the voters, to pull the wool over their eyes in a coordinated fashion. Pecker and AMI stopped engaging in legitimate press activities the moment they agreed to become a covert arm of the Defendant's campaign. Now, similarly, the Defense has pointed out again and again that NDAs aren't illegal in and of themselves. That's true. That's totally besides the point. Contracts aren't -- in and of themselves, aren't illegal, either; but a contract to kill your wife is illegal. It depends what the contract was for. It depends what the NDAs are for. Contracts and NDAs are, indeed, illegal when they serve an unlawful purpose, including when they constitute unlawful campaign contributions. And this is nothing like what had happened in the past between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump. Yes, in the past, Mr. Pecker had declined to print negative stories about Mr. Trump for decades. But, that is fundamentally different from seeking out such stories, to purchase them with the advanced intent of preventing those stories from ever being told. Prior to the August 2015 meeting -- and Mr. Pecker was very clear about this -- he never agreed to publish hit pieces on Mr. Trump's political opponents, he never agreed to be the eyes and ears of Mr. Trump's political campaign, and he never ever paid for a Trump story for the purpose of killing it. No matter how many times the Defense says otherwise, this was not business as usual. And it's true that Mr. Pecker may have crossed the line once or twice before with Rahm Emanuel or with Arnold Schwarzenegger. That doesn't mean the line wasn't also crossed here. The Arnold Schwarzenegger conduct kicked off an investigation into Federal Election Finance Laws -- finance issues. You know what?  You may say -- a lot of people say this: Who cares? Who cares if Mr. Trump slept with a porn star ten years before the 2016 election? Plenty of people feel that way, as I said. But, it's harder to say that the American people don't have the right to decide for themselves whether they care or not, that a handful of people sitting in a room can decide what information gets into those voters' hands. Even if the first two aspects of the Trump Tower deal, the positive stories about Trump and the negative stories about his opponents, even if those were a much seedier version of politics as usual, the catch and kill piece was not. Because, as I said, once AMI purchased stories on a candidate's behalf and in coordination with that campaign, those purchases became unlawful campaign contributions. I suggest to you that the value of this corrupt bargain forged at this Trump Tower meeting cannot be overstated. It turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign. When you put all three of these components together, this scheme cooked up by these men at this time could very well be what got President Trump elected. In the months and years that followed, three separate catch and kills that we know of took place. Mr. Blanche has an excuse for each of them, but the excuse doesn't actually make any sense if you go through the evidence. Just a couple of months after that Trump Tower meeting, this theory was put into practice with the case of Dino Sajudin. Dylan Howard got wind of a Trump Tower doorman, Dino Sajudin, who was trying to sell a story of how Mr. Trump fathered a child with one of his housekeepers. You will recall, Howard was one of the Chief Financial Officers and Editor-in-Chief with Mr. Pecker, who told him: Let me know whenever you see a negative Trump story. Pecker suggested he wasn't a co-conspirator, Dylan Howard didn't like Trump. He had a boss, and his orders were: Tell me so we can tell Cohen, so whenever there's a Trump story, we can kill it. That makes him a co-conspirator, whether he wanted to be or not. As Pecker instructed -- had instructed after the meeting, when Howard got wind of the Sajudin story, he came right to Pecker. And because of the agreement struck at that Trump Tower meeting back in August, Pecker immediately reached out to Cohen, to relay what Howard told him. Cohen told him he would check things out from their side, and later called back and confirmed that both the doorman and the housekeeper were on the payroll. Pecker believed that Cohen had spoken to the Defendant about the Sajudin story because the Defendant had offered to take a paternity test. Moreover, when Pecker told Cohen that AMI would pay for the story, Cohen told Pecker that, \"The Boss would be very pleased.\" This is coming from Pecker. Meanwhile, the National Enquirer reporters were trying to follow up on the story. They didn't know that it was a story that would never be told. On November 14th, Barry Levine emailed Howard, asking for instructions on how to proceed. Remember, Howard is under strict orders. Here -- talk about not wanting to be part of the conspiracy. Here, he said, \"I'd rather have him locked up before we go to Trump's people.\" The very next day, AMI enters into a Source Agreement with Dino Sajudin. The original Agreement, as you know, contained a three-month exclusivity period and a $30,000 payment that was not due until the story was published. And Pecker testified that he was willing to pay far more for this story than the National Enquirer typically would because of the potential embarrassment the story would have to the campaign. National Enquirer doesn't pay $30,000 for a story like that. And, this is rumor and innuendo. And, as you know, it turned out to be not true. But, Pecker told you -- and this is kind of interesting because some of the things said on summation are just not accurate. Pecker told you that if the story were true, it would have been the biggest story since the death of Elvis; there would be no way to justify outright killing a story like that. So, Pecker told you that he would have published it, but, even then, he would have waited until after the election because that's what he discussed with Cohen and that's what he, Cohen, and the Defendant had agreed to back in August. This testimony, despite what Mr. Blanche told you, was not on redirect. This was on direct. This came out right at the first time around. This is what I mean when I say you've got to look at the contents; right. You can't take an isolated question that is put up on the screen and assume that that's the whole story, because there's more to it; right. So, yes, it's true, Mr. Blanche, that Pecker said that he would print the story anyway, but he would wait until after the election because that's what they agreed to do. Because even though it would be better off for AMI, they would sell more magazines in the short-term, they risked getting scooped if they waited until after the election, they were willing to wait because that would help the Defendant's campaign. And that's the only reason. That is catch and kill. So, as you know, AMI reporters conducted their investigation. And, as I said, it turned out the story was not true. But, guess what's interesting. Even though the story was not true, AMI shelled out $30,000 for no legitimate purpose. They had already done their investigation by then. If you remember, the original Agreement said, \"Payment due upon publication.\" The Amendment said, \"Payment due five days after the signing of this contract.\" They knew the story wasn't true. And when asked, \"Why are you paying $30,000 for an untrue story,\" Pecker said -- this is from his testimony on direct: \"Because if the story got out to another publication, it would have been very embarrassing to the campaign.\" This is not a normal, legitimate press function; and it also did not make its way to Mr. Blanche's summation when he was telling you, \"This is not really catch and kill.\" This was really catch and kill. This whole nonsense about the fiduciary duty is out the window here. The only reason to kill a bogus story, the only reason, that's not in service of AMI's investigators, that's in service of the Defendant's campaign. On December 15th, someone at The Trump Organization, we don't know who -- we could make some reasonable inferences here -- called Cohen on his cell, and they spoke for nearly six minutes. The following day, Cohen called Howard. And the day after that, on December 17, 2015, AMI and Dino Sajudin signed the Amendment to the Source Agreement. And, so, as I mentioned, this Amendment called for immediate payment five days after the Agreement was signed. In other words:  We all know that the story is not true, it's not getting published by AMI, so we'll just pay you now so you can't take the story somewhere else. That's what that means. Instead of a three-month exclusivity period, the exclusivity period was extended in perpetuity. And they added this ridiculously disproportionate one-million-dollar liquidated damages clause just to put the fear of God into Sajudin, that: In case you decide to go somewhere else, we're coming after you for a million dollars, to lock him up as tight as possible. Pecker told you, it was Cohen that suggested that clause, and it was not typical for AMI to do something like that. The very next day, Barry Levine sends an invoice to the Accounts Payable folks to provide documentation to the $30,000 payoff to Sajudin. And in the invoice he describes exactly what AMI is paying Sajudin for: a Trump non-published story. The day after that, Howard sends Cohen an email, confirming that the doorman story has officially been caught and killed. This is what it says:  \"It was remiss of me not to contact you yesterday. Nevertheless, I wanted to confirm that the source executed an Addendum to the Agreement with a liquidated damages clause. He has been compensated accordingly.\" This is overt election fraud, an act in furtherance of the conspiracy to promote Mr. Trump's election by unlawful means, one of the many ways in which this unlawful conspiracy was acted upon. It was an illegal corporate campaign contribution made by AMI to Mr. Trump's campaign, and it was done in collusion with the candidate. As you know, Election Day was more than ten months away, but during this entire period, Mr. Sajudin had been completely neutralized as a threat to that campaign. At Cohen's insistence, Cohen held onto that NDA until the election was over. AMI did not release Mr. Sajudin until December 9th of 2016, after the Presidential election. That brings us to the catch and kill volume two, which is the Karen McDougal signing. That began June of 2016, just as Mr. Trump was clinching the nomination. On June 6th, Keith Davidson, Karen McDougal's lawyer, reached out to Dylan Howard; and Davidson texted Howard that he has a blockbuster Trump story. And within seconds, Howard, this non-conspirator to hear the Defense tell it, says he can get more than anyone for it and that Davidson knows why. They agreed to talk the next morning. They did talk first thing the next morning, and they continued to text back and forth about it, as well. I'm going to try not to bore you by showing you every single text that goes back and forth. Davidson tells Howard about McDougal, a former Playboy Playmate that had a year-long sexual, romantic relationship with Mr. Trump. Once again, as soon as he learned this information from Howard, Pecker, true to that Trump Tower agreement, contacted Cohen, just as Mr. Trump had asked him to. In the meantime, Davidson sent a Retainer Agreement to Karen McDougal because Retainer Agreements are, in fact, required, written Retainer Agreements. And discussions continued among Davidson, Howard, Pecker and Cohen. And, you know, they sometimes try to speak in code, but you don't really need to be a code-breaker to decipher some of these. On June 16th, Pecker asks Howard if there's: Any news on our other project? And Howard responds that his: Source, Davidson, is in Cali. At the same time, Howard is talking to Davidson, and keeping Pecker in the loop, and also keeping Cohen in the loop. Pecker told you, during this time he spoke to Cohen frequently, often multiple times a day, often using encrypted apps. Remember, Pecker is talking to Mr. Cohen at Mr. Trump's direction. Pecker let Cohen know he was dispatching Howard to California to investigate the story. Pecker told Cohen he would report back when he found out details. As Cohen told you, he was under strict orders to keep the Defendant informed of these developments. On June 16th, at 6:07 PM, Howard tells Cohen his meeting with McDougal and Davidson would take place Monday, June 20th. Half an hour later, Cohen reaches out to Keith Schiller, the Defendant's bodyguard. Cohen asks, \"Where's The Boss?\" Schiller replies:  \"Next to me.\" Cohen asks at 6:51 PM if Mr. Trump were free to speak. It's not surprising Cohen would be reaching out as soon as he learned about this Karen McDougal story, because he would be -- as he told you, he would be risking his job by not keeping The Boss informed about developments like this. So, within a minimum of this, \"Where's The Boss?\", \"Next to me\", the Defendant called Cohen for an update. Then, on June 20th, Howard is texting Cohen from the plane. He calls Cohen when he lands. Even before he lets Davidson know he's landed, because Howard knows exactly who Cohen is representing, and he wants to keep Cohen in the loop. So, this meeting on June 20th with Karen McDougal is attended by McDougal, Davidson, Howard and Jay Grdina. According to Pecker, during this meeting, Cohen kept on calling Pecker. He seemed agitated and anxious. You could see all those calls in the Pecker-Cohen Summary Phone Chart. I won't show them all to you. You have them if you want to check them out. Cohen was also texting Howard directly. Howard was giving real-time texts, but Cohen wanted to speak on the phone. \"Could he be reached out to?\" He got Pecker to reach out to Howard, even though the meeting was still ongoing. Why?  Because he needed to provide updates to The Boss. Pecker's assistant, Trish McAndrews, also texts Howard. She tells him, \"Pecker spoke to Cohen, and Cohen needs you.\" Howard calls Pecker just as the meeting ends; and Pecker testified -- told you that Howard summarized the interview with McDougal and told Pecker that even though she did not have any physical documentation, that he, meaning Howard, believed her description of her year-long sexual relationship with Mr. Trump. And Howard also reported back to Cohen that he spoke to Pecker, and that they could all hop on a three-way call. During this three-way call -- this is testimony from Pecker -- Howard says explicitly: \"Understand.\" Howard says explicitly:  \"Understand. I've got this locked down for you. I won't let it out of my grasp.\" There's not a lot of room for debate here. Howard is not shopping for a story to print. Howard is acting in cahoots with the candidate to kill the story. Howard texts Pecker's assistant to set up that three-way call. She tells Howard and Pecker -- I'm sorry. She tells Howard that Pecker was in a meeting, but he would step out when he was ready. Pecker told you all about the three-way call. Howard repeated the summary of his McDougal talk with Cohen; and Pecker also testified he told both Howard and Cohen that he thought that Trump needed to buy the story. Then we see a flurry of calls and texts among Pecker, Howard and Cohen, and a nearly 25-minute call from Pecker to Howard, a nearly 50-minute call from Pecker to Cohen. This is all on the day of the McDougal interview out in California. A couple of more calls from Howard to Pecker, Pecker to Howard. A 14-minute call from Howard to Cohen. These negotiations continued over the next month. In late June of 2016, Mr. Pecker was making a presentation in New Jersey to his largest investors, when the office assistant, literally, interrupted that meeting to tell Mr. Pecker Trump was on the phone for him. That's the kind of call you remember. Think about it. Pecker is over in New Jersey, talking to his investors. His secretary comes over and says, \"Mr. Trump is on the phone for you,\" a candidate for President. That's something he is going to remember. He steps out to take the call. And the Defendant explained to him during this call that Cohen had told him about McDougal. Think about what that means for a second. That is testimony from Pecker that during the call from the Defendant, the Defendant told him that he found out about the Karen McDougal story from Cohen. Just as Cohen said that he did. \"Keep The Boss updated.\" The Defendant said to Pecker during this call that, \"Karen was a nice girl,\" which suggested to Pecker that the Defendant knew her. Pecker testified elsewhere that he believed this story of the affair to be true. During the call, they discussed competing offers for the Karen McDougal story. Pecker told Mr. Trump that he thought Mr. Trump should buy the story, but the Defendant was reluctant because he thought that these types of stories always get out. And I guess he was right about that. But, Pecker advised the Defendant to buy the story anyway. He said it was just too risky to leave it out there so soon before the election. He thought -- Pecker thought they should take the story \"off the market\". That's the phrase that he used. Now, they're not talking about helping jump-start Karen McDougal's career here. They're talking about how to protect the campaign from the story that she was prepared to tell. And the way that all ended was that the Defendant told Pecker, \"Let me think about it, and I will have Michael Cohen call you back in a few days.\" Now, with all of the evidence and documents in this case, it's easy to lose sight of the significance of this phone call. Because, unless you believe that Pecker is lying, this call means, first of all, that the Defendant knew Karen McDougal well enough to describe her as \"a nice girl\"; two, that Mr. Trump was overtly discussing purchasing her story to keep it from being published; and third, that Mr. Trump explicitly told Pecker that Cohen was the intermediary, that Cohen would get back to Pecker in a few days with Mr. Trump's decision. So, Trump is deputizing Cohen right in front of Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go-ahead from Cohen is a go-ahead from Trump. This call makes it impossible for the Defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own, that he was taking it upon himself to work with AMI to purchase the McDougal story. And, as we'll discuss later on, this transaction amounted to an unlawful corporate campaign contribution by AMI to the Trump campaign. And this call proves that not only did the Defendant know about it, but he actively participated. This is powerful evidence of the Defendant's involvement, wholly apart from Cohen. Pecker told you that Cohen called him shortly thereafter and told him that he had been listening in to this conversation, to Trump's conversation with Pecker, possibly on speakerphone; and Pecker testified that Cohen said he'd get back to him with the Defendant's answer. He said, \"You should go ahead and buy the story.\" And Pecker said, \"Yeah, I was gonna pay for it.\" And Cohen said, \"Don't worry. The Boss will take care of it.\" Pecker understood, particularly after his conversation with Mr. Trump, that this meant either The Trump Organization or Donald Trump, himself, would reimburse Pecker for any money he spent buying up the story. That's Pecker's testimony. Pecker took it, this call from Cohen, as authorization to have Howard go forward and negotiate the terms of this purchase. And he knew, and he testified that he knew that the authorization was coming from Mr. Trump himself because, as he told you, Cohen was not authorized to buy lunch without Mr. Trump's approval. So, these discussions continued between Howard and Davidson. Cohen and Pecker continued to speak, just as they both told you, by phone and by text. Here's a 20-minute call on July 7th. But, as Davidson told you -- and this part just kind of got left out of the Defense summation because it doesn't really jive with their whole claim that this Karen McDougal thing wasn't a real catch and kill because she didn't want her story to go public. The problem is, that's not what was happening, because, as Davidson told you, he was also simultaneously shopping the story to ABC News. Remember, they were considering a deal where she would get a shot on Dancing With the Stars. That deal would have required her to go public. Now, it's true that Karen McDougal preferred the AMI deal because she thought it would revive her career, and she wouldn't have to be the next Monica Lewinsky. But, her motivations were totally irrelevant. The question is: What was the Defendant's motivation?  What were the rest of the co-conspirators' motivation? Their motivation was to serve the campaign. That's what makes this a catch and kill. On July 20th, Howard texted Davidson: \"Let's talk. Trump, slash, Brian Ross. I think this is the entree for me to go back to him.\" Davidson explained Brian Ross worked for ABC News, and Howard should go back to Pecker if AMI wanted to buy the story instead. So, now, AMI had to get involved. If they wanted to catch and kill the story, this was their chance. If she went with ABC, this would get out and hurt the campaign. That kind of lit a fire under AMI, and they began acting more aggressively to acquire the story. On July 23rd, Howard texted Davidson: \"Get me a price on McDougal. All in.\" Davidson answered:  \"Yes. A million dollars.\" Howard tells Davidson to leave it to him. Several days later, Howard texts Cohen for an update. This kicks off a set of negotiations that, ultimately, lead to the NDA between AMI and McDougal. And all the while, Howard is keeping Cohen in the loop. Howard tells Cohen that McDougal rejected their offer; that Davidson is worried that she's been convinced, if you remember, by the estrogen mafia to go with ABC. So, Howard tells Cohen he implored Davidson to get it done and ensures Cohen that Davidson would get back to him. And they agree on the broad strokes of the deal. They just have to agree to get Karen McDougal to play ball. So, Cohen tells Davidson they will: \"Lay it on thick for her.\" Davidson says:  \"Good. Throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking of the Isle of Mann. LOL. I'm going to Make Australia Great Again.\" The joke is funny because it's a palpable explanation of what they're doing. They're helping Mr. Trump get elected. They're doing that by squashing the Karen McDougal story. Everyone understood what this was about. Trump is looming behind everything they're doing. Later that same evening, Howard tries to convince Davidson that AMI is a better option for McDougal than ABC, and he tells McDougal flat-out that he needs the deal to happen. Howard doesn't want to let Mr. Trump down. Cohen tried reaching out to Pecker the next morning. Pecker calls him back, and they speak for 13 minutes or so. You may recall from Pecker's testimony that before he gave Howard the go-ahead, he discussed the question of who would be paying with Cohen. Initially, Cohen told Pecker that Pecker should pay, but Pecker balked. He explained to you he already laid out -- spent $30,000 for the Sajudin story and wasn't about to spend another six figures on another Trump story. Cohen reassured him. \"Don't worry. The Boss will take care of it.\" Also, on July 29th, Howard tells Cohen AMI is going to pitch McDougal the following week. Davidson sets up a Ring video conference with Howard McDougal and Jay Grdina for August 2nd. The day of the conference, McDougal pitches another $25,000, to make the price $150,000. At 6:05 PM, Howard responds and says: \"Fuck it. That's not my money. I'll ask.\" He immediately calls not his boss, who is going to be writing the check, he calls the Defendant's fixer, Michael Cohen, because it's the candidate that needs to sign off, not David Pecker, because everyone believes that Pecker is going to be reimbursed by Donald Trump. Howard then calls Davidson back. Cohen calls Howard back, as well. And the next day, Davidson again uses ABC's competing offer to push the deal through. And Howard assures him that the mechanics of the deal are being figured out at that very moment. Someone from The Trump Organization calls Cohen the next day, on August 4th. And then AMI sends over a draft contract on August 5th. Only, it's not what Davidson was expecting. He tells Howard that the deal Cameron -- remember, \"Cameron\" is Cameron Stracher, AMI's General Counsel. The deal they sent over wasn't what they were expecting in terms of the content. That's no surprise, because AMI didn't give a hoot about the content. They didn't give a hoot about the magazine covers. For Pecker, as he told you flat-out, these provisions were window dressing. They were there to disguise the true nature of this contract, because, as he also told you, the primary purpose of entering into this contract with Karen McDougal was to acquire her life rights so that she couldn't take them somewhere else, so they could -- it was so they could try to claim some kind of plausible deniability if the authorities started looking into campaign finance violations, just like they had when Pecker did something earlier for Arnold Schwarzenegger, so many years earlier. Pecker wanted these columns and magazine covers to be part of the contract. So, when AMI hired an outside Election Law lawyer, Mr. Blanche said: Well, Pecker didn't hold anything back from this lawyer that they hired. Are you kidding? Pecker testified that he didn't tell the election lawyer about the deal from Trump Tower, about the plan to have the Defendant reimburse AMI for all this. They gave this guy the contract, with nothing else. He spent 30 minutes reviewing it. That was the sign-off that Pecker, supposedly, got. Back to the exchange between Davidson and Howard on August 5th. Howard asks Cam to call Davidson. And Davidson explained he spoke to Cam, and they were both frustrated with the process. Cam told Davidson to call Cohen. After all, it wasn't really AMI's deal. It was the Defendant's deal. They were buying the story for Donald Trump. Davidson is reluctant to call Cohen. Not only because his last brush with Cohen in 2011 wasn't pleasant. Also, I submit, because Davidson didn't want to be so overt about the fact that Mr. Trump was pulling the strings here. He texted Howard:  \"Cam wants me to call Cohen. Do you think that's okay?\" Cohen -- Howard then calls Davidson, and Davidson also sends an email to Cohen, asking Cohen to call him. And Davidson testified that he was reaching out to Cohen as a professional courtesy because he had just closed a deal involving Cohen's client, Mr. Trump. And Cohen told Davidson that he was pleased. And then Howard texts Davidson that AMI will buy the story. Davidson tells Howard that he told Cohen that Howard was instrumental in getting the deal done. And Howard says -- Howard says, \"Cohen is hopeless,\" but he adds something interesting, \"Another one done.\" Presumably, a reference that they have now successfully caught and killed another story on Trump's behalf. So, now the deal is done. The NDA had an effective date of August 5th. It was signed by both McDougal and by Howard, the Chief Content Officer for AMI; and a few days later, AMI paid McDougal $150,000. And this voucher shows the payments. Now, Pecker offered critical testimony about this exchange. I'll just read it to you. \"Question: Were you aware that expenditures by corporations made for the purpose of influencing an election, made in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or a campaign, are unlawful?\" \"Answer: Yes.\" \"Question: Did either you or AMI ever report to the Federal Election Commission in 2016 that AMI had made a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal?\" \"Answer: No, we did not.\" \"Question: Why did AMI make this purchase of Karen McDougal's story?\" \"Answer: We purchased the story so it wouldn't be published by any other organization.\" \"Question: And why did you not want it to be published by any other organization?\" \"Answer: I didn't want -- we didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign.\" \"Question: When you say 'we', who is 'we'?\" \"Answer: Myself and Michael Cohen.\" \"Question:  But for Mr. Cohen's promise that Mr. Trump would reimburse AMI, would you have entered into this Agreement?\" \"Answer: No.\" And you know from the discussion at the Trump Tower meeting that everyone understood Cohen was acting as the liaison with Pecker, Mr. Trump's liaison with Pecker, conveying Mr. Trump's instructions every step of the way. Many of the facts in those questions and answers that I just read to you are also contained in the Statement of Admitted Facts that was part of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that AMI executed with the Southern District of New York. That's in evidence, and you can examine it whenever you like. It was admitted to assist you in assessing Mr. Pecker's credibility and, also, to provide context for the surrounding events. It sounded to me like maybe Mr. Blanche was trying to suggest in his summation that maybe AMI admitted to these campaign finance violations because they were in a rush to get some other deal done."

He said that this would be like \"National Enquirer gold\". Right? Somebody -- a Playboy Playmate of the Year claiming to have a year-long sexual affair with a Presidential candidate, but he never would have published it at any time before or after the election. Pecker was willing to sacrifice AMI's bottom line in service of Mr. Trump's campaign. There's just no way he can get around this devastating fact."

    "text": "This deal was the very antithesis of the normal legitimate press function. AMI paid $150,000, or at least $125,000, for this story, in coordination with the campaign. That is the very definition of an unlawful corporate campaign contribution. Remember, Pecker testified that at the time he valued the content portion of the deal at $25,000, and the life rights at $125,000, which is why that invoice from IAS -- later on, we will get to that in a minute -- only paid for $125,000. Not the whole $150,000. AMI purchased the life rights for, and at the request of the defendant, to help his candidacy. Now, as the weeks go by, Pecker becomes increasingly restless that the defendant hasn't paid him back. And he testified that he spoke -- this is Pecker's testimony, not just Cohen -- that he spoke with Cohen several times about the fact that he was upset and that he wanted to get his money back from the defendant. And Cohen keeps telling him, \"Don't worry, The Boss will take care of it.\" At the end of AMI's fiscal quarter, September 30th is fast approaching, and Pecker wants to have the money back before the date so he could, like, change his records and make this all look legit. So, in order to convince Pecker that Mr. Trump would make good, Cohen taped the conversation with him. And the defense has gone to laughable lengths in a feeble attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of this recording. They suggested that the evidence wasn't handled properly by the investigator who gathered it from Cohen, or because it wasn't immediately put into a Faraday bag. Do you remember that ridiculous cross-examination? Someone who is, like, going to beam these air radio waves onto the phone and plant this conversation on the investigator's way down the FDR. Or, it's not reliable because Cohen continues to use the phone after making the recording. Here's a news flash:  People use their phones; right?  If subsequent use of a phone made any evidence on that phone invalid, then the only useful thing on the phone would be the last thing that that phone did. People use their phones all the time. They do delete things from their phone all the time. They suggested that migrating this data on the phone from one phone to another using iTunes, that somehow made the information unreliable. How many times have you all done that?  How many times have you traded in an old phone for a new phone and you do a factory reset on your old phone before you send it in? After that factory reset, there was a full restore to a new device, and that was testified about. After he got out of prison, Cohen got his phone back from the FBI. There was no hold. No one had to ask Mr. Cohen to preserve everything on the phone. The FBI had already downloaded the relevant evidence, including the recording that the defendant had made -- that Cohen made of the defendant on September 6, 2016."

    "text": "That's in the evidence. Cohen had no idea that we would ask for the phones again in January of last year, and that there would be no conceivable reason for him to destroy evidence of a crime that he already been convicted of and served time for. So, don't accept this invitation to muddy the waters. Or the fact that no one asked Rhona Graff about the fact that her voice is heard on the tape at some point. But, they didn't ask her either because she wasn't even there for the important part of the conversation. You could hear she leaves the room, and that part of the conversation is recorded. That's on the transcript that takes place. They're not going to talk about this in front of Rhona. And the fact is, that no number of misleading questions, wild speculation, or unsupported accusations, allegations, can distract you from one simple fact; the metadata for this file proves that it was not tampered with in any way. Remember the testimony from Doug Daus, the supervisor from the Forensic Unit in the Office, in this Office, who conducted this investigation on these phones, who performed the forensic extraction like he had done on thousands of other devices. He explained on cross-examination. No less, that if this recording had been edited or modified at some point, you would see a timestamp that reflects the time it was edited. But the metadata here shows it was not. It's also kind of funny that the defense wants you to rely on certain information that is taken from this phone, certain texts that they want you to consider, but not the parts of the phone that implicate the defendant. That's unreliable. The phone is unreliable. So, the last ditch effort to get you to ignore this recorded conversation is to say -- is to try to tell you that Cohen was lying about the recording because he said it was interrupted by a live call, and the phone records show the call was interrupted, the recording went to voicemail. Seriously. You could hear on the end of that recording, I think it was played for you on the defense summation, that Cohen was clearly was trying to answer the phone and talked to someone. So, maybe he tried to answer the call, but it went to voicemail. Or, maybe he is just misremembering that unbelievably, insignificant detail. Which is funny, because it actually shows that Mr. Cohen did not conform his testimony to the record because it clearly says in the records that the call went to voicemail. It was eventually routed to voicemail. The larger point here, is that the phone records corroborate his testimony that the recording stopped around the same time as he got an incoming call. Now, it should be perfectly obvious to you all why they're so desperate to figure out a way to get you to reject this piece of evidence, because this recording is nothing short of jaw dropping."

    "text": "This recording shows the defendant's cavalier willingness to hide this payoff. It shows he knew how much AMI paid for the McDougal deal. If you want to, you should take this recording in the back. You can request all the evidence you want. Any or all of it. You could play this as many times and as loudly as you want to hear Mr. Trump say \"One-fifty\" on this tape. It's your decision what the tape says. But, my guess is, if you play it enough times and loud enough and isolate it, you will hear it. This shows the defendant suggesting paying him cash. And it doesn't even matter whether that means a bag of cash, or whether it means no financing; no, you know, a lump sum. It doesn't matter, because the point is, he is trying to do it in a way that is not going to leave a paper trail. That's the whole point. Cohen is basically telling him on this recording that he's going to set up a shell corporation. That he's spoken with Allen Weisselberg, Trump's loyal CFO, about how to do it. This tape unequivocally shows a presidential candidate actively engaging in a scheme to influence the election by reimbursing AMI for killing the McDougal story. And that's why they're so desperate to discredit it. So, now Cohen has gotten his approval from The Boss. And the very next day he starts working with Daniel Rotstein. And the plan is to transfer McDougal's life rights to Mr. Trump by using a shell company. And you will remember, from Mr. Pecker's testimony, that Daniel Rotstein was a former AMI employee, who still consulted, but now had his own business, Investor Advisory Services. And when Pecker didn't want anyone to know what he was doing, he acted through Rotstein's company, to avoid screening. Just as Cohen was using a shell company to disguise the identity of the parties involved in this transaction, so was Pecker. Now, on September 21st, Rotstein created a phony invoice through IAS to bill Cohen's shell company, Resolution Consultants, for $125,000. The invoice reads \"Agreed upon flat fee for advisory services.\" Here is another false business record being created in furtherance of this conspiracy to promote or prevent an election. Because, as Pecker testified, there were no advisory services provided. This was an excuse to sell Mr. Trump Karen McDougal's life rights. Cohen was also in direct contact with Rotstein, mostly through the Signal app. On September 27th, Rotstein asked Cohen if the blank rights assignment template he sent over was okay, and to confirm the name of Cohen's shell company. Pecker and Cohen are also in contact via the Signal app. And on September 29th, the day before Pecker's fiscal quarter ends, Mr. Trump calls Cohen and the call lasted more than seven minutes. Later that same day, Cohen calls Pecker, presumably to say that Mr. Trump signed off on the transfer of McDougal's life rights. Two minutes later, Pecker calls Cohen for more than nine minutes. And by the next day, the transfer documents have been signed, both by Pecker and by Cohen. But, as you know, the transfer never goes through because Pecker runs the idea of selling the life rights to the candidate himself. He runs that by his General Counsel and his General Counsel says; no, don't do that. So he abruptly changes."

Just as a little post script, after the Wall Street Journal article was released on November 4, 2016, AMI eventually agreed to modify the NDA, to let McDougal respond to legitimate press inquiries. But, as with Sajudin, they waited until after the election to do that. You remember it was signed by one party on November 29th and the other on December 7th."

    "text": "Thank you. So four weeks before the election, the campaign was brought to its core by the release of the Access Hollywood tape. And all of a sudden there was a video of a presidential nominee literally discussing grabbing women by the genitals. And Mr. Blanche told you that the only evidence that the Access Hollywood tape was a significant event came from Michael Cohen. But, that's just wrong. It's another example of them trying to make the case about Michael Cohen, when it isn't. Hope Hicks told you that the news was so explosive that it eclipsed the coverage of a Category Four hurricane that was bearing down on the East Coast. I guess this was like a Category Five hurricane. Prominent Republican leaders rushed to condemn Mr. Trump's words. Some even withdrew their endorsements. Madeleine Westerhout testified that the RNC began discussing the possibility of replacing Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee four weeks before the election. Preparations for the second presidential debate only two weeks away were halted as key campaign officials entered damage control mode. It all began with the email from the Washington Post reporter named David Farenholdt to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign Press Secretary. The email contained transcripts of the now famous Access Hollywood videotape. The video was vulgar, to say the least. And this email asked for the campaign's comments, including whether they acknowledged that the video and the transcript were accurate. And Ms. Hicks testified that her initial instinct was to deny the video's legitimacy. But, once the campaign officials got a copy of the actual video, that strategy quickly shifted from deny, deny, deny, to spin. And Ms. Hicks testified that the consensus among the campaign leadership was that this was a crisis. In particular, Mr. Trump felt that this was not a good development for the campaign, but thought that it could be spun as locker room talk. The video was released publicly by the Washington Post on October 7, 2016, at 4:01 p.m. And you will recall that there is a stipulation, both sides have agreed to that timing. Michael Cohen, who was in London at the time, heard about the video, and exchanged emails with Stephen Bannon, who was, according to Hope Hicks, sort of a co-manager of the campaign. Cohen wrote, \"The tape is all over the place. Who is doing damage control?\" And Hope Hicks told that you the media response was intense. That same evening, Mr. Trump posted a response on his campaign website. And the initial response referred to his comments as locker room banter. It accused Bill Clinton of having said far worse and apologizing if anyone was offended. This is somewhat of a mealy-mouth apology, did not come close to ending the news cycle. At 12:19 the following morning, the defendant tweeted out a video in another attempt to stop the bleeding. As he testified, the key component of the defendant's strategy was to try to distinguish between words and actions. Here's a portion of that video."

    "text": "You may notice that this is kind of consistent with the strategy that Pecker and Trump discussed in that August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower, to portray Hillary as an enabler of her husband's womanizing. Chris Cuomo, then a CNN anchor, reached out to Cohen to try to get him on the show to comment on the Access Hollywood tape. Cohen replied that he was in London and he was scheduled to start news shows on Tuesday. Remember, this is Saturday. Cuomo tells Cohen, \"That is too late, Trump is dying right now.\" And for what it is worth, Davidson and Howard also seemed to recognize the import of the Access Hollywood tape. I am not going to read the words out loud, but they kind of speak for themselves. This was kind of the perception after that Access Hollywood tape came out. And on the evening of October 8th, there is a flurry of activity among Hicks, Cohen, Pecker, Howard and Mr. Trump. So, you got the campaign staff and you have the conspirators. And, you don't have to remember all of these. It doesn't really matter. The point is, the flurry of activity. You have Hicks calling Cohen, and Trump calling Cohen, and Hicks calling Cohen, and Cohen calling Pecker, and Pecker calling Howard, Howard calling Cohen. And during these calls, Cohen tells Pecker about an article on Radar Online about Mr. Trump being a Playboy Man. And he tells Pecker to take it down immediately. So, Pecker testifies that he called up Howard and that Howard promised to remove it. And Pecker asked Howard to notify Cohen when it was taken care of. This is exactly what Howard did. He emailed Cohen, \"I have deleted the text story completely. It no longer exists.\" At the same time, Hope Hicks testified that she asked Cohen to use his media contacts to figure out whether there were any other damaging videotapes out there. So, they were privately scrubbing the internet and chasing down rumors to ensure that their public efforts to spin the Access Hollywood tape didn't backfire. More back and forth calls. Howard to Pecker, Cohen to Hicks, Pecker to Hicks, and then Howard forwards to Hicks the confirmation that that Playboy Man article no longer exists. So, this is not a catch and kill exactly, but they are purging the internet at the direction of, and for the benefit of the campaign. And, again, this is not a normal legitimate press function either. Immediately after that, Cohen calls the defendant and they speak for eight minutes about several different matters. Among other things, Mr. Trump told Cohen to use his media relationships to help spin the Access Hollywood tape as locker room talk. A spin that Melania Trump had recommended. Now, that second presidential debate took place the next day, on October 9th, and as Ms. Hicks testified, one of the first questions put to Mr. Trump was about that Access Hollywood tape. And, according to Hope Hicks, the defendant again described his remark as locker room talk. Just words. Not actions. Hicks explained that after the debate additional reports regarding Mr. Trump's behavior with women surfaced. And Trump grew increasingly concerned about the impact that these allegations were having on voters. Particularly, women voters. He repeatedly addressed these concerns at rallies and campaign events and on social media, eclipsing some of the other campaign messaging and priorities. You have to remember, this race could not have been closer. The Access Hollywood tape and the reports that followed it were capable of costing him the whole election, and he knew it. Here's the defendant at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, on October 14th."

    "text": "The defendant posted similar comments on his Twitter account. Here's a tweet from October 15th. \"Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me.\" And the next day, October 16th, \"Polls close. Can you believe that I lost large numbers of women voters based on made-up events that never happened?  Media rigging election.\" And the day after that, \"Can't believe these totally phony stories. One hundred percent made up by women. Many already proven false and pushed big time by press. Have impact.\" Now, the defense wants you to think that the Access Hollywood tape wasn't a big deal to the defendant. It was just another blip. And Ms. Necheles got Madeleine Westerhout to say on cross-examination, \"That everyone was freaking out except for the defendant.\"  Please. Ms. Westerhout admitted on redirect, she had zero, zero firsthand knowledge about the defendant's reaction because she didn't work for him at the time. She was down in D.C. Hope Hicks, on the other hand, was in the room where it happened. And she said that the defendant knew it was a crisis. And you have got the defendant's own tweets, videos and speeches which demonstrate just how worried he was that this could affect the outcome of the election. Now, the reason I say all of this, you really can't understand this case without appreciating the climate that was taking place in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape. And you can't examine it with the benefit of hindsight. Right. Mr. Blanche said:  Well, he won and the Access Hollywood tape came out. Therefore, it wasn't a big deal. That is not really true. It caused pandaemonium in the Donald Trump campaign. And at the time, many people, including campaign officials and the defendant himself, believed that the fallout from this Access Hollywood tape could tip the election. And it's critical to appreciate this because during the exact same month that the defendant was desperately trying to sell the distinction between words and actions, he was negotiating to muzzle a porn star who was prepared to go public with allegations of an extramarital sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Stormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the Access Hollywood tape. So let's back up for a minute. In April, and then again on June 28th, Gina Rodriguez, Stormy Daniels' manager, reached out to Howard about the Daniels story. And she made it clear that Ms. Daniels was willing to share the story of her sexual encounter with the defendant, with the press. And this is the story that was already out there. It was already out there in a gossip column in 2011, with no firsthand account, and it was taken down after Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen got involved to have the story removed. This is nothing like one of the two parties to a sexual encounter going public with the details of that sexual encounter. Ms. Rodriguez refers to the fact that Mr. Trump promised Ms. Daniels a spot on The Apprentice, but never delivered. She tells Howard that Daniels met the defendant at a celebrity golf tournament when she was there with Wicked Pictures. Howard tells Rodriguez he will get back to her. Rodriguez is a little overzealous here and she wrongly says that the sex happened on multiple occasions, which is something Ms. Daniels has never said. The following day, Howard lets Davidson know that Rodriguez is shopping the story again. And you have texts between Rodriguez and Howard that are in evidence, and you ever seen them as People's 171A. You basically see over the next few months Rodriguez tries a few times to follow up, but Howard doesn't seem particularly interested. No one is particularly interested at this point. So there is nothing to kill. But, that changed on October 7th when the Access Hollywood tape was released because that changed the whole landscape. Rodriguez didn't waste much time reaching back out to Howard. Remember, she is reaching out to Howard, not to Cohen. Not to the defendant. And Howard suddenly seems a lot more interested. He tells her he needs to bring it to his CEO, which is Pecker, and Pecker would likely pay. That she agrees to send him the pitch and there are a flurry of calls over the next hour or so. Cohen to Pecker, Pecker to Howard, Howard to Cohen. Cohen says he and Howard spoke about the Access Hollywood tape, the Playboy Man article, and the fact that Daniels had resurfaced. Howard to Pecker; and if you remember, this was a while ago, you remember Mr. Pecker said he was having dinner on a Saturday night with his wife and he was interrupted by a call. This is likely the call that interrupted Howard's dinner on October 8th. You have got Cohen to Pecker. You have got Cohen to Trump. And Cohen tells him, among other things, that Stormy Daniels is back. And this is on October 8th. You see Howard to Davidson. Howard then goes back to the table negotiating literally over texts with Rodriguez. And Rodriguez tells him that there are other news outlets that are interested. Literally over texts. They finally settle on a price of $120,000. And Howard went so far as to say, \"I will send you the contract tomorrow.\" And, if you remember, that Davidson testified that by the time he was brought in to paper the deal, the $120,000 price had already been negotiated by Howard and Rodriguez. He added the extra $10,000 as his own fee for papering the deal. This is part of the reason that that extortion narrative is so clearly bogus. Because neither Daniels nor Rodriguez ever reached out to Trump, nor to Cohen, to try to sell them the story so it won't be published. They were brokering the deal of the story to AMI, where, at least Rodriguez and Daniels thought it would be published. But, as both Pecker and Davidson told you, AMI decided they didn't want to buy another story. Not after spending $30,000 on Sajudin and $130,000 on McDougal. By then Pecker knew there was not any legitimate way to structure a deal so that he could get reimbursed by Trump. So he says, \"I will take a pass.\" And Howard learns that Pecker won't pay a few minutes later. He tells Pecker, \"The woman wants $120,000. This story is true. I can buy it.\" But, Pecker walks. As he told you, he wasn't a bank. Howard acknowledges that, and he says, \"Okay, if you don't want to buy it, we should call Cohen, so Cohen could handle it directly on Trump's behalf, rather than going through AMI.\" And at 8:38 p.m. Pecker says, \"Yes, it's a good idea.\" One minute later, Howard calls Cohen, and Howard calls Pecker back, then calls Cohen again. And he then confirms with Pecker that he spoke to Cohen \"All sorted. Now removed. No fingerprints. I'll recap with you face-to-face.\" Pecker explained that he understood that this meant that AMI was kicking the story over to Cohen to purchase it directly on Mr. Trump's behalf. Howard then speaks with Davidson, enlisting his help, and he gets back to Cohen and he says, \"Keith will do it. Let reconvene tomorrow.\" Pecker thanks Howard for extricating AMI, and Cohen thanks Howard for bringing Keith on, and seems to tell Howard that he will use Resolution Consultants to make the transaction. And then Howard officially passes the torch over to Cohen, by connecting Cohen and Davidson regarding that \"business opportunity.\" And, once again, AMI, make no mistake, AMI is involved here. AMI is acting as the campaign's eyes and ears. Just as Pecker told Mr. Trump he would do. Now, I'm certainly not going to go through every call among the key players in this case. They're all in evidence if you want to go deeper here. But, you see after the calls from Rodriguez to Davidson, and Davidson to Howard, and between Cohen and Davidson, and all the back and forth has begun, and the very next day, on October 11th, Davidson sends over the draft Settlement Agreement. He emails Cohen with drafts of not only the Confidential Settlement Agreement, but the Side Letter Agreement, and the wiring instructions to his attorney IOLA account, which is like a Trust account. And he puts in the email that neither Daniels nor Davidson himself gets to keep a copy of the Side Letter Agreement. And he sends a funding deadline of October 14th. And that is the same day the defendant is making that speech about five percent, ten percent believingness"

    "text": "sic). This is all happening at the same time. That same day, Cohen tries to -- and, I'm going back to same day of this email, which is 10/11. That same day, Cohen tries to reach his banker Gary Farro, to try to set up a bank account for Resolution Consultants to effectuate the payment if his delay strategy fails. And we then enter a two week stretch where Cohen gives the barrage of excuses why he hasn't wired the $130,000. Again, we don't need to show all these calls and emails back and forth. They're in evidence, if you want to see them. Cohen's excuses include the office being closed for Yom Kippur; never receiving the contracts; never receiving the wiring instructions, et cetera, et cetera. Meanwhile, Pecker continues to speak to both Hicks and Trump, and Pecker and Cohen are also in communication with each other via the Signal app, which shows that -- if you take a screen shot, we only have a few screen shots from Cohen's phone. The screen shots don't show the duration of the particular call. They just show that a call happened. So, Pecker and Cohen are in communication on the Signal app. You see several on October 13th, including the last one at 9:12 a.m. And that same day, Cohen funds or he opens but never funds the bank account for Resolution Consultants at First Republic Bank. Just a few minutes after that Signal call with Pecker, which was at 9:12, at 9:23 a.m., Cohen emails Gary Farro, his banker at First Republic. First Republic sends him the account opening paperwork to fill out. You probably remember that. Maybe not. It was a while ago. First Republic Bank is the top email, it's in Pacific Time, and all the rest is New York time. Cohen does so, he signs the paperwork and he sends it back. In doing this, Cohen falsifies another business record. The business information overview, because he gives a description of the services provided. \"Resolution Consultants is a consulting firm. Michael Cohen provides individuals and businesses financial services, law firms, technology firms, et cetera. Advice on strategy, PR, marketing, best practices and procedures, et cetera.\" That is one about big lie. But, Cohen couldn't very well say, I'm opening this account so a presidential nominee can pay off a porn star. Farro told you that First Republic did not get involved with the pornography industry. So, reporting the truth may have prevented the account from being opened in the first place. Cohen also reported that the entity that he was opening was not involved in political fundraising or Political Action Committee. Had he answered this question truthfully, Mr. Farro explained this would have been additional scrutiny. Now, whatever else you could say about this defendant, he's a savvy businessman. He opened his share of bank accounts. He knows you have to give a reason when you open a bank account. He knew that any reason his fixer would be giving would have to be false to get past the bank's compliance process. Now, meanwhile, Davidson is getting tired of being strung along. He reminded Cohen he had a client and the client's manager who felt the same way. But, Davidson knew who was pulling the strings here. And this is from his testimony: \"QUESTION:  And what was the relevance based on your conversations with Michael Cohen about?  What was the relevance of the fact that Mr. Trump was in three or four or five different states? \"ANSWER:  What did that mean to me? \"QUESTION:  What did it mean to you? \"ANSWER:  To me, it was similar. It's a situation I run into all the time. It was similar to, like, someone who doesn't have the purse strings. It's like an attorney who has to go call an insurance adjuster. Like that. Michael Cohen didn't have the authority to actually spend money, despite the fact there had been so many excuses and the funding deadlines that had already been missed. \"QUESTION:  You believe that Michael Cohen did not have the authority to spend the money? \"ANSWER:  Yes.\" And Davidson was very clear about how he interpreted Cohen's statement; I will just do it myself. \"QUESTION:  Even after he said 'I'll just do it myself,' where did you understand the money would be coming from? \"ANSWER:  From Donald Trump or some corporate affiliation thereof.\" Now, on October 17th, Cohen realizes that he has to be ready to consummate this deal quickly if push comes to shove because the election is only three weeks away. And, coincidentally, he remembers that the name Resolution Consultants is already taken by somebody that he knows and so he creates a new shell company called Essential Consultants LLC"

    "text": "And that same day, Davidson voids the contract for nonpayment and steps away from the deal. But Gina Rodriguez tries to pull Howard back into the mix to try to jump start this deal. She texts him again on October 17th, that we are not doing the Trump deal. Howard said he heard as much from Davidson. And Rodriguez tells Howard about the delay tactics and tells Howard that the Daily Mail wants it bad, so we are doing it. And Howard wastes very little time in relaying that information to Cohen. They also have a phone call and it works. Cohen immediately reaches back out to Davidson to try to get him back on board. Ten minutes later, Cohen calls Trump to update him. But it looks like the call -- it looks like he doesn't reach him because the call only lasts eight seconds, and Cohen testified that he left a voicemail. The next morning, Melania Trump reaches out to Cohen and asks him to call Mr. Trump on his cell. And Cohen was at work, and he believes that he called the Defendant from his landline at work. This is a reminder, that is one of the numbers because you don't have records of outgoing calls. The absence of a phone record does not mean that a conversation did not take place. At the same time, Davidson texts Howard, I can't believe Cohen let this go. It's going to be a shit show. And Davidson is pretty much out of the deal at this point, but he tells Howard that he hears that Rodriguez and Daniels had struck an alternate deal, and Howard is in disbelief. He said:  All because Trump is tight. And there is a lot of phone activity over the next few days. We won't show it all. Howard and Rodriguez. Howard and Davidson. Howard and Rodriguez. Howard and Cohen. And then on October 23rd, a rare call from Allen Weisselberg, and on a Sunday no less. Cohen explained that Weisselberg left a voicemail regarding funding for the Daniels NDA. And when I say, rare, I am talking that these guys have like six phone calls in like three years. The next day, on October 24th, there is an encrypted call between Cohen and Pecker at 4:32 p.m. And then you have this Keith Schiller call that we have already discussed. It's actually a call from Schiller in the middle of that text exchange. The call goes to voicemail, but Cohen calls back a minute later. And you can see what else is going on around that time with the other players. Over the next two days there is a renewed push to get the deal done. Another flurry of calls ensues and now we are at two weeks before Election Day. Davidson tries to reach out to Cohen. Cohen speaks to Pecker. Rodriguez and Howard. Howard and Davidson. And on October 25th, Howard tells Davidson he is going to see Pecker shortly, and he asks Davidson for an update. And Howard does go and see Pecker, and Pecker tells you about it. He tells us about the agreement between David and Cohen that's about to fall through. And do you remember what Pecker said? Pecker was not happy because Pecker thought that Howard was a low fingerprints, all removed, all spread out from Michael Cohen, but Howard was clearly still involved in getting this done. As Pecker testified, Dylan came to my office towards the end of October and said there was an agreement between Keith Davidson and Michael Cohen. It was for $120,000 and Michael Cohen was supposed to wire the funds to Keith Davidson twice. He never did. Dylan was upset. He was very agitated. And he said that Michael Cohen is going to make him look very bad with his two top sources. And he said, you understand when you renege with a source what the impact would be. So, he asked if I would get Michael Cohen on the phone. I set up a Signal call to Michael Cohen. So, it was Michael Cohen, myself and Dylan Howard. Howard was very aggressive on the phone with Michael Cohen for not paying. Michael Cohen said, that I should pay. He said, David, you should pay. I said, I am not paying for this story. I don't want to be involved. I didn't want to be involved in this from the beginning. I said, I am not doing it. I said, Michael, my suggestion to you, you should buy the story. You should take it off the market because if you don't, and it gets out, I believe The Boss will be very angry with you. And so, then Davidson -- Davidson then speaks to Howard. And Howard reaches out to Cohen and tells him that Davidson is calling you urgently. He says, we have to coordinate something on the matter he is calling you about or it could look awfully bad for everyone. Howard is texting Davidson and relayed the message he just sent to Cohen, and he is clearly trying to get both sides back to the table. And you have another ensuing flurry of calls, some of them on encrypted apps, all in the next half hour. Cohen to Davidson. You don't have to remember all of these. The point is that there is a flurry of phone activity among the co-conspirators here. Pecker calls Cohen on the encrypted app. Cohen calls Pecker also on Signal. Davidson to Cohen. Pecker to Cohen. Cohen to Pecker. Pecker to Cohen. Davidson to Cohen. Pecker to Cohen. This is all in a half hour. Cohen to Pecker. A long call from Cohen to Davidson. And Howard gets back to Davidson after the three-way call with Cohen and Pecker and tells Davidson, push for the cash. He specifically tells Davidson that he and Pecker just wrote Cohen he has to pay the 150,000. And during the same time, while Cohen and Pecker are calling each other repeatedly on Signal -- like I said, I am not going to bore you with every Signal record here -- there is another call between Howard and Davidson. Attempts by Cohen to reach Davidson. Davidson calls back and speaks with Cohen. And then another rare call between Cohen and Allen Weisselberg on October 25th. Remember, there are six calls in three years between these guys. Well, two of them happened in the three days leading up to the Stormy Daniels payoff. The next morning, on October 26th, Cohen calls Mr. Trump, and they speak for three minutes. Cohen explained that he was seeking and got final approval to fund the deal. Another SureCall from Cohen to the Defendant at 8:34 a.m. And the defense has tried to suggest -- I mean, this is damming. This is a half an hour before Cohen goes across the street and initiates the paperwork that leads to the wire transfer. Half an hour before that, he is getting the final go ahead from Donald Trump. So, the defense has tried to suggest -- they didn't say it on summation -- when they were cross-examining Michael Cohen, they tried to say:  Well, there were other things going on the day before, or a couple days before, Tiffany Trump -- somebody was, you know, trying to -- was looking into something on behalf of Tiffany Trump, and you were so busy. It was two weeks before the election. Obviously, they were talking about other things. They didn't need the whole four-and-a-half minutes on this phone call to talk exclusively about the Stormy Daniels' NDA, and Cohen acknowledged that. He said, we talked about other things. And just after nine a.m., presumably as soon as they opened, Cohen starts emailing with Patti at Delaney Corp. to get the necessary documentation to open a bank account. And he obtains the evidence of filing for Essential Consultants. He then calls DeWitt Hutchins, the banker at the First Public Branch closest to Trump Tower. Cohen calls Davidson. Davidson sends the wiring instructions, again, for his Attorney Trust Account, and Hutchins opens the bank account for Essential Consultants with Michael Cohen sitting there. As part of this process, yet another false business record is created, the Know Your Customer or KYC Form. This form contained the following narratives supplied by Cohen: Michael Cohen is opening Essential Consultants LLC as a real estate consulting company to collect fees for investment consulting work he does for real estate deals. Again, had he filled out the form accurately, it would have resulted in additional scrutiny by the bank compliance people, causing delay and possibly leading to the bank's refusal to open the account or to send the wire transfer to Davidson. Then you have the Wire Transfer Form, which describes the purpose of the wire as a retainer. Yet another false business record to effectuate this transaction. This wasn't a retainer. This was a payoff. And at this point, of course the deal is ready to close. Lisa Rappaport, Gary Farro's Assistant, sends the Client Services Group a request to transfer 131,000 from Cohen's HELOC into the Essential Consultants brand new bank account. And she notes that it is a time sensitive request. Rappaport let's Cohen know that the funds have been transferred, and Cohen forwards the email to Davidson, and at 8:23 p.m. on October 26th, Howard sends the email to Davidson and Cohen memorializing everyone's understanding. And Howard and Davidson have a text exchange confirming that the funds have been wired. Finally, the deal is signed on October 28th, 11 days before Election Day. And you know that the deal uses pseudonyms to mask the true identities of the parties. Like Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, signs as Peggy Peterson. And Michael Cohen signs on behalf of Essential Consultants. And as you know, Cohen insisted that the Daniels' NDA include a 1 million-dollar liquidated damages clause for every breach. Davidson didn't think it was enforceable because it was so out of whack, so disproportionate to the payment that she was getting. Now, it's true that Mr. Trump didn't sign these documents himself. But that's kind of the whole point, right, to keep him out of it, to keep him away from the documentation. Cohen testified that there would be no reason to have the Defendant sign it because there was no benefit to the Defendant for him to sign it. It wasn't necessary in order to have a binding NDA against Daniels, and Davidson certainly had no reason to insist once the money was wired. What did he care? The objective of the NDA was to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, period, and they had enough to do that. The same day the deal was closed, the 28th, or at least signed, Cohen calls the Defendant. The day that he received -- that Cohen received the paperwork and signed it, that's the day he calls Donald Trump to let him know the deal is done and to get credit for side-stepping this landmine. It's no coincidence that the sex happened in 2006, but the payoff didn't take place until October 27, 2016, less than two weeks before the election. And that's because the Defendant's primary concern was not his family, but the election. Pecker testified that in early November, Schiller called Pecker; and Schiller is the conduit. Schiller called Pecker on behalf of the Defendant. Hope Hicks said Schiller was the conduit. And Pecker said that when the Defendant called -- I am sorry. When Schiller called, he said, The Boss heard that McDougal was speaking to ABC News after all and Pecker asked Howard to check that out with Davidson, who told Howard that it wasn't true. And so, Pecker called Schiller back and asked Schiller to relay that to The Boss. But as it turns out, four days before Election Day, The Wall Street Journal wrote the story that AMI had caught and killed, the McDougal story, at Mr. Trump's behest. And the campaign, once again, entered into damage control mode. And this is four days before the election. The Defendant's Fixer, Michael Cohen, began working the phones. He screamed at Davidson, accusing him of lying and accusing him of violating the NDA. He rallied the troops to issue denials, including the denial about the Pecker issue. There was another flurry, and I mean a real flurry of phone and text activities among the key players in both the conspiracy and in the campaign. And I am going to just rush through this because the point is really more about how they were circling the wagons starting at the hours before the article was released and the reporters began contacting Hicks. 4:30 p.m., Hicks gets an email from The Wall Street Journal reporter, Michael Rothfeld, asking for comments on the story that AMI bought McDougal's story and killed it. It's clear that AMI has also reached out to the parties to the NDA itself. Davidson tries to reach Howard. And then Davidson texts Howard:  Call me. Davidson calls Howard. And Howard calls back. And Davidson calls again. Cohen calls Davidson. Hicks calls Pecker. She testified that she wanted to find out more about it because she had been clearly kept in the dark. Howard calls Cohen. Davidson calls Cohen. Pecker calls Hicks. Hicks calls Cohen twice. And together, if you remember, Cohen and Hicks, concoct this denial, blaming the liberal media and the Clinton machine for the McDougal story. Now, Hicks was playing it straight. She testified, I submit, credibly that she had never heard the name Karen McDougal. Cohen was very familiar with the name, but he slid seamlessly in to lie-on-behalf-of-Mr. Trump mode. And Hicks also testified that she ran the potential statement, this potential statement by the Defendant, but Mr. Trump insisted on drafting his own statement, complete with a denial of both the affair and that he knew anything about the AMI deal. But now you know that that was a total fabrication, that is the statement that this Defendant put out on October 4th after The Wall Street Journal article was a lie. It was a lie because he said he didn't know anything about the Karen McDougal deal, but he did because he is on tape from two months earlier talking about it. And if you remember that Pecker testified that the Defendant called him when he was in New Jersey with his investors back in June to talk about it. Why?  Why did Mr. Trump lie about that?  Why? Back to this crazy flurry of events. Davidson called Howard. Hicks calls Cohen. This is all on the Fourth and Fifth. Cohen calls David. Howard calls Cohen, twice. Hicks calls the Defendant again. Cohen texts Hicks to call him. She does, and they speak for more than seven minutes. Pecker then calls Cohen. Davidson calls Howard. Keith Schiller reaches out to Cohen to see if he can take a call. Hicks calls Cohen. Davidson calls Cohen. Cohen calls him back. Pecker calls Howard. I hope you are getting all of this. Davidson calls Howard. Cohen texts Hicks twice to see if there is any news, and she then calls him. And then Keith Schiller tries to reach Cohen. And Cohen calls back and speaks quite clearly to Mr. Trump for nearly six minutes. And Cohen explained that he told Mr. Trump about all the efforts he had made to secure denials from Pecker, from Davidson, but the Defendant was still angry. He was angry because, once again, the story came out that threatened his standing with female voters. The flurry continues. Hicks calls Pecker. Cohen calls Howard. Hicks calls Cohen. Howard calls Davidson. And then -- by the way, this is all right before the article comes out. Because at some point that evening, late that evening is when The Wall Street Journal publishes the article, and Hicks texts Cohen a copy of the article. And they agree at that point that the best strategy is to ignore it and hope it blows over. Pecker calls Howard. And Pecker testifies that he asked Howard to call Davidson and make sure that McDougal hadn't gone, in Pecker words, off the reservation. He wanted to make sure she was still on board. Meanwhile, Hicks tells Cohen to pray. The first thing the next morning Cohen calls Trump again via Schiller, and they talk for more than 15 minutes. Later that morning, Hicks tries to get Pecker's cell from Cohen, and she testifies that Mr. Trump wanted to speak with Pecker. And later, Hicks let's Cohen know that they spoke because it's clear that the, they, means Trump and Pecker. And Pecker also told you that the day, remember -- I don't know if it is -- it has been awhile. The day after The Wall Street Journal article revealed the inner workings of the McDougal deal, Pecker got a text from Cohen alerting him to the fact that Mr. Trump wanted to speak to him. And then, as Pecker explained, Donald Trump called him at home on a Saturday. Trump was very upset, saying, how could this happen?  I thought you had this under control. Either you or one of your people have leaked the story. This is the story that he is simultaneously telling the press he knows nothing about. Pecker denied being responsible for the leak, but he told you Trump was furious, and he hung up without saying goodbye. Again, Pecker establishes unequivocally that Mr. Trump was in on the McDougal deal, and that he was upset that it wasn't locked down as well as he wanted. Davidson and Howard text back and forth about the efforts to make sure that McDougal stays on board. Around that time Pecker puts out his bogus statement denying the validity of The Wall Street Journal article. He explained -- he told you -- he testified the reason that he did that was to protect himself, his company and Donald Trump. And it kind of worked because the story pretty much fizzled after that. Around this time, Cohen and Hicks discussed how the strategy seems to be working, and Howard relays to Pecker -- Howard relays to Pecker that Davidson confirmed McDougal will move forward with the deal. And Howard tells Pecker the next day that the story only caused one day of discomfort and back to the campaign issues. And that was a good thing for the Defendant because the election was only three days away. Now, Hicks explained, frankly, that Mr. Trump was concerned about the effects of the article both on his wife and on the campaign. This is from her testimony: Question:  And after it was published on November 5th, did you discuss the article with Mr. Trump? Answer:  I did. Question:  What, if anything, did you discuss? Answer:  Um, he was concerned about the story. Um, he was concerned how it would be viewed by his wife, um, and he wanted to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning. Question:  Did he also ask you whether it was -- whether you thought it was likely to affect the campaign? Answer:  Um, everything we talked about in the context of, you know, this time period, in this time period, was about whether or not there was an impact on the campaign. So, certainly, I don't recall specifically him saying that, but everything was -- something that Mr. Trump said a lot is, how -- how is it playing? He wanted to know how things were playing, whether they were playing well or playing poorly. And that could have been in a speech, an article, a tweet. I don't want to speculate, but I am almost certain that he would have asked me, how is it playing? And he wanted to know how I felt the next few days were going to go, and if this was going to be a big piece of the next few days. And then, on November 8th, the Defendant was elected President. And as the results began to trickle in, some of the players in this conspiracy were very conscious of the role that they had played in influencing the election results. Just before 10:00 p.m., New York time, Davidson texts Howard:  What have we done? And Howard seems to recognize the significance as well. It says:  Oh my God. Now, Davidson testified that this was sort of a gallows humor, but the humor like they were joking about ambassadorships was based on their mutual understanding, and I quote, this is from Davidson's testimony: That our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Of course we will never know if this effort to hoodwink the American voter made the difference in the 2016 election, but that's not something we have to prove. The point is that the reimbursement to Cohen was cloaked in false business records to hide the conspiracy; the conspiracy to promote or prevent the election, whether or not that conspiracy actually succeeded in tipping the scale. Is this a good time, right about now?"

    "text": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. So, we have talked about the conspiracy to influence the election. And even after Mr. Trump got elected, he still had to make sure that no one found out about the conspiracy. But here is the problem, Michael Cohen was out $130,000, and the Defendant knew that he couldn't just write Mr. Cohen a check for the exact amount of the Daniels' payoff, so enter the false business records. But make no mistake, Cohen wanted the credit for helping carry out the payment to Daniels, but he also wanted his money back. And he was telling anyone and everyone who would listen. In November or December, Pecker went to Cohen's office, and Pecker testified that Michael said to me he wasn't reimbursed for monies owed to him on the Stormy Daniels payment, and Pecker understood Cohen to be complaining that he hadn't been repaid yet. And Pecker also believed that the plan was that Cohen would be reimbursed either by Trump himself or by The Trump Organization. And Cohen actually asked Pecker to intervene on his behalf to Mr. Trump and speed up the reimbursement. And Mr. Davidson also testified about a call on December 9th that he got from Cohen while shopping at some oddly-decorated box store, if you remember that testimony. And Cohen called, and he was upset about a few things, and he said, and I quote, that fucking guy is not even paying me the 130,000 back. And Mr. Trump was also aware of how upset Cohen was. If you remember, Cohen testified that when he was on a Christmas vacation, Mr. Trump called him, and he told him not to worry, that he would take care of everything when they got from back from their vacation. And when Cohen got back, he spoke with Allen Weisselberg, and Allen Weisselberg asked Cohen to bring in a copy of his bank statement showing a $130,000 payment so that they could work it all out. And on January 16th or 17th, Cohen met with Weisselberg, and then, together, they went into Mr. Trump's office and met with him. And, as requested, Cohen brought in that bank statement. And right on the bank statement, Weisselberg and Cohen calculated all the money that was owed to Cohen. And Weisselberg explained how they were going to pay him back. They would treat it as income, but gross it up so that after taxes Cohen would be whole. And when they were done speaking, they went in to see Mr. Trump. And Weisselberg discussed the repayment plan with Trump and Cohen. And he showed Trump the bank statement with their handwritten calculations. And he explained to Cohen how we, meaning he, and Allen Weisselberg and Trump, preferred to break the payments up over 12 months, even though Cohen preferred a lump sum. And Mr. Trump approved the payment plan. This is from the testimony. Question:  Now, what happened when you went into Mr. Trump's office to have this discussion? Answer:  During the discussion, Allen turned around and said to me, um, while we were talking about this, it was -- and what we were going to do is this, we are going to pay you over 12 months. It was probably better if I get it in one lump sum. No, no, no. Why don't you just do it over 12 months, and it will be paid out to you monthly. Question:  Did he say anything about how it would be paid out to you? Answer:  Yeah. He said like -- as like for legal services rendered since I was then being given a title of Personal Attorney to the President. Question:  And we will get to that in a second. So this conversation that you had with Mr. Weisselberg in Mr. Trump's office, with Mr. Trump? Answer:  Yes. Next page. Question:  And did Mr. Weisselberg reflect these payments over 12 months on that bank statement, People's 35? Answer:  Yes. Question:  And can you just read there what it says there in the middle of the bottom? Answer:  It says, 420,000, divided by 12, that's an equal sign, and that's 35,000. And that's per month. Question:  So, it was -- and so, it was stated did Mr. Weisselberg state in front of Mr. Trump that you were going to receive $420,000 over the course of 12 months? Answer:  Yes. Question:  And what, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at the time? Answer:  He approved it. And he also said this is going to be one heck of a ride in DC. Question:  And did Mr. Weisselberg say in front of Mr. Trump that those monthly payments would be, you know, like a retainer for legal services? Answer:  Yes. And this is why when Mr. Blanche shows you single questions taken out of context you need to be skeptical. The robust and full conversation is very different from what one question and one answer reveals. Now, we don't have to prove that the Defendant made, he created the false entries himself. The Defendant is guilty of false business records when he makes or causes a false entry in his business records; but approving this reimbursement scheme, that is causing such false entries, period. Directing Cohen to submit phony invoices to a company the Defendant owned and controlled is what kicked off this entire series of false records. As McConney told you in connection with these payments he was told to do something and he did it. That's how The Trump Organization worked because that's how the Defendant wanted it to work. So, the Defendant gave his orders to Allen Weisselberg and to Michael Cohen. And Allen Weisselberg and Michael Cohen gave orders to Jeff McConney. And McConney gave these orders to Deborah Tarasoff. And the false business records are created. And you've got to keep in mind that Allen Weisselberg is the defendant's top lieutenant for 40 years. In one of the book excerpts in evidence, the Defendant describes Weisselberg as a loyal employee and one of the toughest people in business when it comes to money. Now, sometime between that meeting and the inauguration on January 20th, Weisselberg went to see Jeff McConney, Controller, to put the plan into action. In fact, McConney testified that they spoke twice. He said during their first meeting, if you remember, Weisselberg tossed him a pad, and he started taking notes about what Weisselberg was saying. And McConney testified that some time afterwards, Weisselberg gave him that bank statement with the handwriting on it and that's the same bank statement that Cohen and Weisselberg wrote on and brought in to the Defendant. So this was from McConney's testimony: Question:  Directing your attention to the time period around January 2017, did you became aware that Mr. Cohen needed to be reimbursed for money he was owed. Answer:  Yes. Question:  How did you first became aware? Answer:  I had a conversation with Allen Weisselberg. Next page. Question:  Please describe the conversation that you had. Answer:  Allen said to me he had to get some money to Michael, reimburse Michael. He tossed a pad towards me, and I started taking notes on what Allen said. Now, just pause for a moment to consider what this testimony means. Think about who McConney is. He was the Controller and a loyal Trump Organization employee for 34 years. He has no axe to grind. He has every incentive to help his former boss. But he told you that he knew that this was a reimbursement because that's what Weisselberg told him it was. Mr. Blanche pretended that this was all coming from Michael Cohen. But this document, these two documents, People's 35 and 36, these are Trump Organization documents. It came from them, and it was admitted into evidence through Jeff McConney. These two Exhibits, People's 35 and 36, are the over-manifestation of the agreement of falsified business records. In other words, they are the smoking guns. They completely blow out of the water the Defense claim that the monies paid to Cohen were payments for legal services rendered in 2017. I am almost speechless that they are still trying to make this argument that the payments in 2017 were for legal services rendered. These documents just completely blow that out of the water. But, I guess that if they admit that this wasn't really that, that this was really a reimbursement, then they have to admit that the business records were false in the first place. So, they have to stare at these pieces of paper and tell you with a straight face that this is not that, this does not prove that the payments to Cohen were reimbursement. On the left of the screen is a bank statement that Weisselberg gave McConney. It's the bank statement for Essential Consultants, and it shows a $130,000 debit for a transfer to Keith Davidson Associates for 130,000. And Cohen has written, plus 50,000 paid to Red Finch for tech services, 180,000. And of course we know that Cohen didn't really spend $50,000 on Red Finch; and that may matter for his character, but it does not matter for the crimes that the Defendant is charged with. The handwriting on the left side of the page belonged to Weisselberg. McConney, who had worked with Weisselberg for some 30 years at this point, not only recognizes the handwriting, but can decipher it. It starts with $180,000, which McConney understood to come from the request for reimbursement for the $130,000 to Davidson and the $50,000 to Red Finch. It says:  Gross up to $360,000. Now, this is not Michael Cohen telling you that this was grossed up. This is in the document itself, gross up. Mr. McConney testified that he understood this to mean, doubling to offset taxes. And the Defense showed you another line from that out of context that seemed to suggest that Michael Cohen didn't know why this was being grossed up. We didn't have time to make a slide over lunch, but here is what Michael Cohen actually said. This is an answer. Then he told me that he was going to do -- it's called gross it up, because I was taking -- because I was taking it as income. And in order to get back the 180, you need to actually double it because of tax purposes. Because I was in the 50 percent tax bracket City, State and Federal. So, in order to get back the 180, what he did was then he wrote down 360. Question:  Did he tell you that he wanted to gross up that number of 180 to 360? Answer:  Yes. Question:  And what was your understanding about why he said he needed to gross up 360,000? Answer:  Because otherwise you wouldn't get back your 180. It would be, obviously, less. If they gave me the 180, and I didn't gross it up, after taxes onto it, it would be 90. That is -- and then that's, again, assuming that you take it as income as opposed to just a wash. So, not the one line that Mr. Blanche showed you, but the rest of his testimony makes it very clear that Michael Cohen was very clear about what they were doing here in grossing up this reimbursement. And that's also what McConney told you that he understood this doubling to be, to offset taxes. Add another $60,000, for a total of $420,000, divided by 12 equals 35,000 per month, effective February 1st, 2017. And on the right of the screen you have the notes that McConney is scribbling on that pad while Weisselberg details just how he, the Defendant and Cohen are going to commit this crime. They are acting in concert, and the Judge will explain this concept to you. So, these are his notes. Cohen will get a bonus of 50,000. He will be repaid the 180,000 we owe him. And unlike what Mr. Blanche told you, McConney specifically testified that he understood the 180,000 on his handwritten note to be the same 180,000 from the notes on the bank statement. He wrote, in his own hand, McConney, times two for taxes, because Weisselberg told him to double the 180,000 for taxes. And, you know, when somebody incurs a work-related expense, you spend $200 on a hotel room, you put in for that. You don't pay taxes on that. That's a reimbursement. McConney testified that in 50 years of doing tax returns and 50 years at The Trump Organization, he was never aware of another expense reimbursement where a payment was doubled for taxes. But, here, Weisselberg, Cohen and Trump have disguised this reimbursement as income, and that means that Cohen will have to pay income tax. And, as you know, he pays about 50 percent income tax. So, I was going to explain all of this, but I didn't even realize how clear Cohen explained it in his testimony. If they gave him back 180,000 or they treated it as income, he only gets 90. So, they have to times two for taxes, which is exactly what McConney writes to make sure he netted the full 180,000. That's what grossing up means. And here is a question for you:  Is there anything you have learned about Donald Trump during this trial that makes you think that he would pay twice what he owes someone? But it was worth it. It was worth it to hide the truth about what this money was really for, a reimbursement for the Daniels payoff. Back at People's 36, McConney wrote down -- if you remember, he wrote down the wrong bonus amount. When he added it all up, he got $410,000. Weisselberg looked at the pad and said, no, use 420,000 divided by 12. And the Defendant and Weisselberg agreed to pay Cohen out in monthly installments so they could pretend it was a monthly retainer. That's 35,000 a month, effective 2/1/17. And it also says:  Wire monthly from DJT. Meaning the DJT Entity accounts. McConney told you that that was the account that they used to wire money from the Defendant. And Donald Trump, DJT, was the MDS software code that was used for that particular account. And then below the line, again, this is McConney's note pad that he is writing down as Weisselberg is talking:  Start 35,000 a month in January 2017. Mike to invoice us."

    "text": "ADA Steinglass laughs.)  This is -- these documents are so damming that you almost have to laugh by the way Mr. Blanche tried to explain them to you, that this wasn't fraud -- these weren't false business records, because if they were, they would have destroyed it, okay. So, let me see if I follow that logic. So, they would have destroyed evidence, committed another crime, to hide this crime, but because they didn't do that, and these documents actually exist, that's evidence that a crime wasn't committed? If that's true, you could never prosecute a false business records claim because the existence of the false business records in the first place would prove that there was no intent to defraud. Doesn't that seem a little circular to you? So, McConney staples these two documents together and puts them in his payroll book, which he kept in a locked drawer in his office. And so, now The Trump Organization has two sets of books, one that McConney keeps locked up in his office and the other that goes into the General Ledgers for the outside accountants. Later, based on these same false records and this repayment scheme, The Trump Organization generated false 1099s. These are the 1099s. And they are false because they describe what is a reimbursement as non-employee compensation. Income. And Mr. Blanche told you that they put these into evidence. That's incorrect. We put them into evidence. Does that mean that Mr. Blanche is lying or does it mean that he's mistaken? I submit that it means that he's mistaken, as people sometimes are. And these documents, which were put into evidence by us, demonstrate that The Trump Organization filled out phony forms reporting income that didn't exist; because it wasn't income, it was a reimbursement. And these didn't just go -- these 1099s didn't just go to Michael Cohen, they went to the IRS. Now, it's true that the result of this improper accounting is that the taxes would have to be paid that weren't owed; right? You don't have to pay taxes on a reimbursement, so then, you know, you don't have to report them as income. So, the result of reporting them as income is the more taxes are getting paid than are owed. But, as the Judge will tell you, it's a crime to prepare false tax documents, regardless, even when doing so does not result in underpayment of taxes. And preparing these false tax documents is yet another unlawful means that the defendant and his cohorts were willing to engage in to conceal their election conspiracy. On February 6th, 2017, McConney sends an email with the subject line:  \"Dollar sign. Dollar sign.\"  Reminding Cohen to send over the invoices that Cohen spoke to Allen about. Two days later, Cohen met with President Trump at the White House in the Oval Office. And the President asked if he was okay, if he needed money? And Cohen said, he was all good. And then President Trump told Cohen to make sure to deal with Allen, and that the January and February checks would be forthcoming. Not a detailed conversation, but enough to reassure Cohen that the plan to reimburse him was moving forward. This is his testimony: \"QUESTION:  Did you discuss in the Oval Office the reimbursement payments that were going to be made to you?\" \"ANSWER:  Yes, ma'am.\" \"QUESTION:  Can you tell the jury a little bit about that conversation?\" \"ANSWER:  So, I was sitting with President Trump and he asked me if I was okay. He asked me if I needed money. And I said no. All good. He said, because I can get a check. And I said, no. I said I'm okay. He said, all right, just make sure you deal with Allen.\" \"QUESTION:  Did he say anything about anything that would be forthcoming? \"ANSWER:  Excuse me? \"QUESTION:  Did he say anything about what would be forthcoming to you? \"ANSWER:  Yes. It would be a check for January and February.\" So much for the Defense claim that there was no evidence that they knew that Mr. Trump knew or had anything to do with those first two checks. Do you remember the January, February checks, they came from The Trust. There is evidence that Mr. Trump knew. And it's right here. And the -- and the phone extraction that Doug Daus did from Cohen's phone showed a 4:33 meeting with POTUS -- President of the United States -- on February 8th of 2017. And there is also an email from Madeleine Westerhout in evidence confirming this meeting time and the accuracy of the data on Cohen's phone. So, there is another reason that you can rely on the data from his phone. And, shortly thereafter, a series of invoices, vouchers and checks followed. February 14th, Cohen emails McConney. He apologizes for the delay, and he asks that the checks be mailed to his home address. And McConney reminds Cohen that he has to send invoices first. He doesn't say retainer. There is no retainer. Not an oral retainer. Not a written retainer. There is no retainer. And Cohen -- and McConney doesn't ask for the retainer -- for a retainer, a nonexistent retainer, he asks for invoices. And the response to this has to be one of my favorite emails in the whole case, because Cohen doesn't even remember the reimbursement amount. McConney is the one with the documentation. They didn't give Cohen a copy"

Now, the Defense has tried to suggest, still, remarkably, that these payments really were compensation for legal work that Mr. Cohen was doing in 2017. And in his opening Mr. Blanche told you, quote, \"You are going to learn that this was not a pay back. The 35,000 a month was not a pay back to Mr. Cohen for the money he gave to Ms. Daniels.\" By now, having seen Exhibits 35 and 36, you have to know that that argument is nonsense. The Defense argues that there is an email from Weisselberg to Cohen at the end of January 2017 asking him to prepare the Agreement that we discussed. They say, AHA, that's proof that there really was a Retainer Agreement contemplated. No one ever said otherwise. Cohen testified that there was some talk of a retainer. But the plan was always to disguise the reimbursement as income pursuant to a retainer. Maybe if they had actually created a phony Retainer Agreement that would have given more cover to their story, but it would have been just another false business record, and you would have been considering 35 counts instead of 34, because these payments had nothing to do with the Retainer Agreement and nothing to do with services rendered in 2017. And, by the way, did you happen to notice that Weisselberg approved the invoices without ever getting a Retainer Agreement from Cohen? They decided that the false invoices alone provided sufficient cover, and they cut the checks every month regardless. Now, we've already seen those smoking gun documents. I'm not going to put that back up to show that they add up to $420,000, paid out over 12 months in $35,000 installments. And this document here, People's 45, is a query of the General Ledger system for all monies paid to Cohen from January 1st of 2017 to January 5th of 2018, from any Trump Organization entity. The total amount paid to him in 2017 was $420,000; $105,000 from the DJT Revocable Trust and $315 from the DJT entity. Those numbers, those are the exact same numbers that show up on the 1099s because one is issued from The Trust and one is issued from the DJT entity. So, in 2018, Cohen continued to do legal work for Mr. Trump. That was the testimony. Remember, February of 2018 was when Cohen began to enforce the NDA against Daniels. And he did that because he was told to do that both by the Defendant and by Eric Trump. And Cohen probably did more legal work in the first three months of 2018 than he did in all of 2017, but he wasn't paid a nickel in 2018, both McConney and Cohen told you that. But you can check the General Ledgers, which are in evidence, the 2018 General Ledgers for legal expenses. And you can confirm that he wasn't paid a dime. So, why, if he was still doing legal work, why wasn't he paid a dime in 2018?  Because he wasn't being paid for legal work in either year. He was being reimbursed in 2017, and when the reimbursements were done, the payments stopped. But didn't Mr. Blanche say, well, Cohen did do legal work in 2017. He did a little bit of work for Donald Trump and Melania Trump, something about Madame Tussauds' Wax Museum. Yeah, he did. The testimony was that he did less than ten hours of legal work that year. Cohen spent more time being cross-examined at this trial than he did doing legal work for Donald Trump in 2017. And, based on everything that Mr. Trump has said and done, do you think that there is any chance, any chance that Trump would have paid $42,000 an hour for legal work by Mr. Cohen? That would be a pretty sweet hourly rate, if you multiple that out, there are 52 weeks a year, 35 hours a week, that would be over $1,250,000, that would be a pretty good hourly rate. The fact is that Cohen did pretty well here. He got a cool title:  Personal Attorney to the President. And he used that title to get some very lucrative consulting clients. Nobody ever said he kept that a secret. Mr. Blanche said, well, he signed -- well, he signed every email, it wasn't a secret. We are not saying it was a secret. He used that title to get himself his consulting clients for which he was paid $4 million. He was making way more money than any Government job would ever pay. And don't I know that. He could afford to throw in a couple of extra hours of work over the course of the next year without sending a bill. He's not working for free. It's called good will. And don't buy the Defense argument that the hourly -- he wanted to keep -- when I say \"good will,\" he wanted to keep Mr. Trump happy; right, so that he could keep the title Personal Attorney to the President and keep monetizing it to the tune of $4 million. That's not working for free. And don't buy -- the Defense tried to argue that the hourly rate Cohen was getting from his consulting clients was equally inflated. He wasn't being paid an hourly rate to be a consultant, he was being paid to provide access to Mr. Trump. That's how it works. At the time, President Trump was a Washington outsider. And Cohen was in a perfect position to monetize the close relationship he had with Mr. Trump for so many years. That's why he was being paid so much. He was not being paid per phone call by those -- by his consulting clients. Notice that none of Cohen's invoices went through The Trump Organization's Legal Department, because according to McConney, that would have been the typical practice for a genuine legal invoice. Then it didn't go through the Legal Department because it wasn't for legal services rendered. And if you have any lingering doubt, the defendant has, himself, repeatedly admitted that the payments to Cohen were a reimbursement. He did so in legal filings when Daniels sued Trump to get out of the NDA. This is from Daniels testimony: \"QUESTION:  Do you recall -- you recall the lawsuit that you filed, your lawyers filed against Mr. Trump to get out of the NDA; do you remember that?\" \"ANSWER:  Yes.\" \"QUESTION:  And do you remember that Mr. Trump was represented by counsel in that case?\" \"ANSWER:  Yes.\" \"QUESTION:  And do you recall that his attorneys, Mr. Trump's attorney, in court papers, filed in June of 2018, confirmed that Donald Trump in 2017 had reimbursed Michael Cohen's company Essential Consultants for the $130,000 that was paid to you?\" \"ANSWER:  Yes, I saw that.\" \"QUESTION:  So that was confirmed in Mr. Trump's lawyer's submitted court papers; correct?\" \"ANSWER:  Correct.\" Now, the defendant also admitted that in a filing with the US Office of Government Ethics, a document that the defendant signed and certified its accuracy. The funny thing about this is that Mr. Blanche put this up to say that, see, everything was above board, but he's completely missing the point of the significance of this document. He wasn't charged with some ethical violation. He made an admission in this document. It's an unmistakable admission. It says, quote, in the interest of transparency, while not required to be disclosed as reportable liabilities on Part 8, in 2016, expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump attorneys, Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses, and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017. The category of value would be $100,001 up to $250,000 and the interest rate would be zero. Notice how 180,000 falls into that range, but not 360 or 420,000. Because the amount being reimbursed, as this says, was $180,000 or was within that range. And, the defendant has admitted that this was a reimbursement in his own Tweets. Then President Trump denied that this payment had anything to do with the campaign. Now, that's just plain false. We have been through about two hours of testimony and exhibits and evidence that shows that it had everything to do with the campaign. He may not have used campaign funds to pay off Daniels, and he has never been accused of that, but as we've seen, the payment had everything to do with the campaign. It was an unlawful campaign contribution to the campaign. It was not a payment by the campaign. But, more importantly, the defendant has admitted that the payments to Cohen were a reimbursement for a NDA. And, yet, they still try to argue that the payments to Cohen in 2017 were for legal services rendered, because to say anything else is to admit that the business records were false. And they can't do that. I don't know, I don't want to belabor this, but think about for a minute about what you have to accept in order to buy this Defense argument. You have to think that both Pecker and Davidson were lying when they testified under oath that Cohen told them in 2016 that he expected to get paid back. You have to think that McConney was lying when he testified under oath that Weisselberg overtly said they were reimbursing Cohen. You would have to disregard the handwritten notes on the Essential Consultants bank statement itself showing exactly how the Stormy Daniels payment was converted into a $420,000 repayment amount. You would have to disregard the fact that all of the checks and accounting records showing that $420,000 just so happened to be the exact amount that Cohen was paid in 2017. You would have to disregard the fact that Cohen wasn't paid a dime in 2018, even though everyone agrees he was doing legal work that year as well. And you would have to disregard the defendant's repeated admissions that he knew the payments were a reimbursement. You would have to think that despite this mountain of evidence, none of that actually happened, and Cohen was instead getting paid pursuant to a Retainer Agreement that does not exist and that the amount he was paid just happens to magically match down to the penny the reimbursement amount that was shown in the evidence. Does anyone believe that? And because the defendant repeatedly admitted that he knew that the payments were a reimbursement, that means by definition he knew that the payment records which disguised the reimbursement as income were false. So, the Defense has tried to advance this claim that the defendant only discovered later -- and Mr. Blanche said something like that in his summation -- the payments were actually reimbursement. That's not what the evidence shows. These are his books. And the uncontested testimony is that Mr. Trump helped work out the repayment details before the first check was ever cut. Six days after the White House meeting, McConney asks Weisselberg to approve Cohen's invoice. Weisselberg says, \"Okay to pay. Per Agreement with Don and Eric.\" And you remember, it was not Don and Eric's deal. It wasn't their agreement. Don and Eric were the Trustees of The Trust. They've got to sign the checks, that's what this means. Don't buy the suggestion that this somehow means that Cohen and Weisselberg cooked this up on their own or that Don and Eric cooked this up on their own. Trump had already approved the payment plan before he ever left for D.C. You know from McConney's testimony that this plan had been hatched in January, before the inauguration. And there was just no way that Weisselberg or the Trump kids could or would approve a $420,000 payment of the defendant's money without discussing it with The Boss. And, of course, you know that the defendant signed the last nine $35,000 checks personally. So, then McConney emails Tarasoff in accounts payable to pay the invoice from The Trust and to post it to legal expenses, to put \"retainer\" for the months of January and February of 2017 in the description. And the first two checks may have come from The Trust, but the defendant, Weisselberg, and Cohen still orchestrated these payments. And Tarasoff, of course, does what she's told. She's not in on it. She enters the information into the General Ledger by creating these vouchers. And the invoices include the month, and they include falsely the word \"retainer.\"  Because the payments were falsely described as payments for services rendered in a particular month of 2017 and pursuant to a Retainer Agreement that didn't exist. These weren't really legal expenses at all because the defendant didn't actually pay a lawyer. He paid a porn star by funneling money through a lawyer. Each of these records is a false business record. Tarasoff then uses the same system to create the checks and the check stubs and the stubs and the attached checks. Those are also false business records because they also contain a false reference to a non-existent retainer for a particular month. And for each check, there are two checks stubs and the check itself, all on a single sheet of paper. If you see the check, you see the check stub, necessarily. Tarasoff also placed an accounts payable stamp on the email chain that includes the phony invoice. And those invoices are stamped and kept and maintained by The Trump Organization to justify the checks, that's how the Accounting Department works. And they were stapled to the checks so that the person signing the checks would have the necessary backup information to determine what the check was for and decide whether or not to sign it. And I know what you're thinking, is this guy going to go through every single months's worth of checks?  The answer is no. We are just going to do one more, because this is from The Trust, and we are going to do one from the time that Mr. Trump was paying it on his own. So, we will go through, if you look here, we will use December. On December 1st, at 9:11 a.m., Cohen sends the December invoice to Weisselberg. Care of Donald Trump. He can't email Mr. Trump himself because Mr. Trump refuses to use email. As Cohen testified, during certain conversations, Mr. Trump would comment that, quote, he knows too many people who have gone down as a direct result of having emails that prosecutors can use in a case."

    "text": "That was the testimony directly on Page 3276. And it fits; right?  You haven't seen a single email. Mr. Trump does not use email, famously. Why? Because he does not want to leave a paper trail. Why? Because he can have his lackeys do it for him. Weisselberg forwards the email to McConney and McConney forwards it to Tarasoff, with instructions to pay it. And as she does every month, she stamps the invoice with her accounts payable stamp and files it as the backup to the December check and check stub. And this invoice, which is kept and maintained by The Trump Organization, is another false business record, insofar as it erroneously describes the reimbursement for payment for services rendered that month pursuant to a nonexistent Retainer Agreement. And she then creates another false entry in the General Ledger system describing the reimbursement as a retainer for the month of December. And you know Tarasoff may be doing the typing, but the defendant is causing the false business records. She creates another false business record, which is the check and the check stub, falsely describing the reimbursement as a retainer for the month of December. And this check, like all the checks between April and December, is signed by Mr. Trump himself, by hand, using his distinctive signature. And, of course, each check and check stub was stapled to the stamped invoice, falsely characterizing the amount owed as payment for services rendered, pursuant to a nonexistent Retainer Agreement. And that was not just her general practice, as Mr. Blanche told you, it was the practice that she followed even after the defendant went down to Washington. She specifically said that she did that with these checks and invoices. You can -- on some of these you can -- I know these things have been Xeroxed a bunch of times, but you can actually still kind of see the staple marks on some of these. Now, it's easy to just throw a bunch of mud on the wall and see what sticks, but what is the Defense actually saying here? Let's just consider it logically. Trump didn't know about the reimbursement?  It was all cooked up by Weisselberg and Cohen?  That's crazy. Neither one of them had anywhere near that kind of authority. Even Weisselberg, the CFO, could only approve invoices up to $10,000 and no one could sign the Donald Trump checks besides Donald Trump. But let's just assume for one -- let's play this out. This is the Defense argument. Let's play it out. Weisselberg and Cohen approve this reimbursement scheme all on their own. So, now it's April, whatever, and Mr. Trump gets his small stack of checks and invoices and he's flipping through and he's paying his 80 dollar Verizon bill and he comes to a $35,000 check to Michael Cohen, the Personal Attorney to the President, the guy who is basically doing no work at all for Mr. Trump. And there is no one else he works for, right, he's the Personal Attorney to the President. So whatever work he's doing, he's doing for the President. So then what?  This guy is doing no work. What does Mr. Trump do at that moment, when he suddenly realizes we're paying this guy $35,000? Does he pick up the phone and call Allen Weisselberg? Does he call Cohen and say why am I paying you $35,000 for nothing?  No. He just signs it. Every month. And he never once picks up that phone. He never once make further inquiry. I mean, the December invoice that I just showed you is for services rendered in the month of December and it says on December 1st, at 9:11 a.m. How do you wrack up $35,000 of legal services in eleven minutes? Despite his frugality and his attention to detail, the defendant didn't ask any questions, because he already knew the answers. In total, there were eleven false check stubs and accompanying checks. The first two, as you know, were signed by the Trustees, including Weisselberg, Don Junior and Eric Trump. And the remaining ones were all signed by the defendant. And, please, don't buy this bogus narrative that the Defense is selling that the defendant was too busy to pay attention to what he was signing or that he had no idea how his own business records were. He's in charge of his company for 40 years. The defendant's entire business philosophy was and is to be involved in everything, down to the negotiating the price of the light bulbs. And it's so hard to get away from this basic truth that the Defense has tried to invent some type of a line, like to say, well, maybe when he was a businessman, he could afford the time to read every check, but when he was President, he didn't have that kind of time. And they even got Madeleine Westerhout, his loyal White House Assistant, to imply that there were times when he was so busy that he would just willy-nilly sign Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders without reading them."

    "text": "But that's just another false narrative sprung by the defense to get you to ignore the evidence. The Defendant remained involved, even with minor decisions about where his money was going. Ms. Westerhout testified on direct examination that she had dozens of communications with The Trump Organization in 2017, that they were in constant contact about scheduling the Defendant's contacts and his personal expenses. She noted that both Weisselberg and Cohen were on the Defendant's short list of preferred contacts so they could reach him whenever they needed to. Westerhout recalled that maybe a couple of times she knew that the Defendant would actually call Weisselberg or someone else in The Trump Organization with a question about a check that he was considering signing. And Ms. Necheles desperately tried to walk that back on cross-examination. But, you can read the testimony as a whole for yourself. Her testimony was corroborated by Rebecca Manochio at The Trump Organization, who said that after the Defendant went to the White House, he would hold on to individual checks if he had questions about them. That was her testimony. On February 21, 2017, the Defendant was consulting on whether to suspend a golf membership at a particular golf club that will cost him less than $7,000 for the whole year. He asks Ms. Graff to pay it ASAP. He okays it with his initials. Now, if after Mr. Trump became President, he didn't have time to review his own invoices and checks, he could have changed the procedures so that he's not the only signatory, the way he did with the entities he put into The Trust. He could have allowed Weisselberg or Eric or Don Junior to sign the checks from the DJT entity, or he could have let his wife sign the checks, or used AutoPay to pay some of the utilities. Why set up these systems to bypass the White House security protocols?  Why, literally, send checks to his employees' homes so he could sneak them into the White House undetected?  Why have the invoices go from Cohen, to Weisselberg, to McConney, to Tarasoff, to have her stamp them, and have her attach the invoices to the check stubs, and then have them go to Tarasoff, to Manochio, to McConney, to Weisselberg, to Trump, and go through all of that again. The answer is, because Mr. Trump wanted to maintain control over his $80 cable bill, because that's who he is, and that has been his philosophy from the beginning. He's frugal. He's immersed in the details. And he insists on signing his own checks. The Defendant has written several books extolling these exact characteristics as virtues. During cross-examination, the Defense tried to put daylight between the Defendant and his own books, implying some of the words in the books had been written by ghost writers. It reminds me of the book by Yogi Berra. \"I really didn't say anything I said.\" The publishers were very clear whose books they were and how much control the Defendant had over the manuscripts. First and foremost, the Defendant is frugal. He doesn't like spending money, and he's proud of it. It's worked for him. This passage is from Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: \"Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances, such as percentages and cents. Numbers that seem trivial add up and have enormous implications. My parents hammered frugality into me at an early age, and it's the most important money management skill a person can use. Call it penny-pinching if you want to. I call it financial smarts.\" The book is entered into evidence. I have a number of similar quotes, how the Defendant takes pride in his frugality. And he said every dollar spent by any one of his companies is a dollar that comes out of his own pocket. That's how his good friend, David Pecker, described him, \"very cautious\" and \"very frugal\", in his testimony before you. The Defendant is also a micro-manager, someone who insists on being involved in the details whenever his finances are concerned. The cardinal sin for Mr. Trump is overpaying for anything. Here is another excerpt from that same book. Page 68. \"Always look at the numbers yourself. If things turn grim, you're the one left holding the checkbook.\" Another. Page 69: \"The point I was making to Jeff was that even though various payments always need to be made, always question invoices and never accept a contractor's first bid. Negotiate. Negotiate or get out. Jeff got the message and has been with me for 17 years and is doing a terrific job. He looks out for my bottom line as if the money were his own.\" McConney told you the exact same story about this anecdote. This one People's 114B, an excerpt from How to Get Rich: \"If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, down to the paper clips, you're setting yourself up for some unwanted vices.\" Another excerpt from Think Like a Billionaire: When you're working with a decorator, make sure you ask to see all of the invoices. Decorators are by nature honest people, but you should be double-checking regardless.\" This next excerpt from Think Big: Make it Happen in Business and Life, under the title Do Not Trust Anyone, it says: \"I used to say, go out and get the best people and trust them. Over the years I have seen too many shenanigans, and now I say get the best people and don't trust them. Do not trust them because if you don't know what you are doing, they are going to rob you blind. I know dozens of sophisticated business people who hired accountants and lawyers and others and they trusted them. They got killed. They lost their businesses. So I say, get the best people and don't trust them.\" So, if Donald Trump is checking the invoices from his decorator, you can bet he's checking the invoices from Michael Cohen. This is also Mr. Pecker's understanding from dealing with Mr. Trump. He testified that the Defendant was very detailed oriented, a micro-manager and that he looked into all aspects of whatever he was doing, whatever the issue was. And Ms. Westerhout also describes him as the type of person who also pays attention to details. Now, it's this combination of frugality and attention to detail that led Mr. Trump to keep tight reign on his checks, in particular, whether they were from the DJT entity or other Trump Organization entities. From Think Like a Billionaire:  \"As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged.\" These passages are much longer. You can read them if you like. They're conveying the Defendant's philosophy. It's a philosophy backed up by the witnesses who testified, the people who worked with him, and the people who knew him: Pecker, McConney, et cetera, Westerhout, Manochio. This is from the introduction to Think Like a Billionaire:  \"Here's something else about God that any billionaire knows: He's in the details, and you need to be there too. I couldn't run a business any other way. When I'm talking to a contractor or examining a site or planning a new development, no detail is too small to consider. I even try to sign as many checks as possible. For me, there's nothing worse than a computer signing checks. When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing what's really going on inside your business, and if people see your signature at the bottom of the check, they know you're watching them, and they screw you less because they have proof that you care about the details.\" That's his philosophy. Along those lines, David Pecker described an occasion where he saw Ms. Graff bring a stapled packet of stamped checks and invoices, and he watched the Defendant review the invoices along with the checks and sign. Now, the Defendant created the protocols at The Trump Organization with these characteristics in mind. This was his company, and his philosophy was to check and double-check everything. And for the DJT entity checks, remember, the Defendant was the only one who ever could sign them. For all the other checks, it depended on the dollar amount. I don't know if you remember this testimony from Ms. Tarasoff. Before 2015, Weisselberg could sign checks up to $2,500. After 2015, when the Defendant was on the campaign trail, the number was increased to $10,000. Ms. Tarasoff also testified that Mr. Trump sometimes sent checks back unsigned and handwrote the word \"void\" on it. And, of course, that certainly suggests that he was reviewing these checks before signing them. So, this chart is in evidence as People's 350. You can have it if you ask for it. It shows kind of the sum total of false business records in this case, a total of 11 false invoices, 12 false vouchers, and 11 false checks and check stubs. Each of these false business records correspond to a count in the indictment. That's also indicated on this chart, which false business record pertains to which count. Now, the false records were designed to cover up the Defendant's and his cohorts' efforts to corrupt the election. But, there was also a coverup of the coverup. Because on January 12, 2018, The Wall Street Journal broke the story that Cohen, Trump's lawyer, had brokered a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence in the weeks before the 2016 election. And after the story broke, the Defendant had a fascinating conversation with Hope Hicks about it. This is from her testimony: \"Question: Did he,\" speaking about President Trump, \"say anything about the timing of the news reporting regarding --\" \"Answer: Oh, he -- yes. He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\" That is devastating. And that's from the Defendant's own Communications Director, who still respects and admires the Defendant so much. That was the last thing she said on direct. And she basically burst into tears a few minutes -- a few seconds after that. Because she realized how much this testimony puts the nail in Mr. Trump's coffin."

    "text": "This means that any desire to protect his wife from finding out about Stormy Daniels was far less significant for him than his desire for winning the 2016 election. It's better to deal with it now in 2018, regardless of Melania's feelings, than it would have been to deal with it before the election. Cohen testified that Mr. Trump told him to push the Daniels deal out as long as possible, because if he wins, it will have no relevance because he'll already be President, and if he loses, he doesn't even care. This is the Defendant, caring about the election, not his family. Mr. Pecker told you the same thing. Once Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, it was all about the election and not about Melania or the rest of his family. And Ms. Daniels told you back in 2006 and 2007, the Defendant never asked her to keep their encounter a secret. He invited her to Trump Vodka, showed her around, and kissed her hello. Mr. Trump didn't express any concern at all about his family finding out. He wasn't anxious to silence Stormy Daniels until he became Candidate Trump. Surely, after that Wall Street Journal article came out, Pecker and Cohen received letters from the Federal Election Commission, the FEC, informing them an investigation had been opened into the McDougal and Daniels payoffs. Pecker said Cohen was cool as a cucumber. He told Pecker he had nothing to worry about, that President Trump had Attorney General Jeff Sessions in his pocket. Nevertheless, Cohen was in damage control. On February 6th, he sent the following to Maggie Haberman of The New York Times: \"Big boss just approved me responding to complaint and statement. Please start writing and I will call you soon.\" Trump had authorized Cohen to disseminate a highly misleading, if not flatly false, statement."

    "text": "Just like Cohen pushed Davidson to have Daniels sign. So, here's the denial. It's beyond misleading. It says Cohen used his own personal funds, which is technically true, I guess, because the money came from his HELOC. It says neither the TO or Trump campaign reimbursed him. Cohen is clearly trying to distinguish between the man and his company. Although, there is no separate Trump bank account, and both the DJT and The Trust are under the Trump Organization umbrella. What's clear is that Trump, himself, reimbursed Cohen. The Defendant admitted as much in legal filings. Finally, it says that the payment to Daniels was not a campaign contribution. That's just plain false. It was a campaign contribution, and Cohen knows that better than anybody else because he went to prison for it. Jay Sekulow is an attorney who he, at the time, represented the Defendant, and shortly before Cohen put out the statement, \"We discussed sexual\" -- he put out a statement to Cohen using an encrypted app: \"Client says thanks for what you do.\" What Cohen does and what he had just done is to lie for the Defendant, to fall on the sword to protect the President. This text shows the Defendant giving Cohen what he craved most: recognition for his efforts on the Defendant's behalf. Now, the Defense, if you've noticed, throughout the trial they like to refer to the DJT entity as Mr. Trump's personal account. They use the word \"personal\". And his personal expenses were, indeed, paid from that account, like his $80 Verizon bill. This is nothing like yours and mine's checkbook. The company name is DJT. That's what's in the vouchers. McConney explained each company has its own code, and the code for the Trump account was DJT. DJT was an entity of the Trump Organization, like all the 500-some-odd entities. Its books were kept by the ten-something accounting staff, and it had its own General Ledger, invoices were entered into the MDS system. As McConney told you, that MDS system can issue reports for balances and other reports that the accountant would need to prepare tax returns or financial statements. Every time Ms. Tarasoff cut a check from the personal account, she had to enter it into a voucher form from the MDS system. Then she printed the checks, stapled them to the invoice, and sent them to Mr. Trump. The Defendant insisted the invoices were attached to the checks, so he would know exactly where his money was going. This practice continued after the inauguration. The Trump Organization employees handled getting checks to Washington for the President to sign. And when the checks came back from Washington, Deb Tarasoff would pull them apart, mail the signed check to whoever, Mr. Cohen or whoever else, and file the backup documentation along with the other Trump Organization records. More importantly, the DJT entity account was a clearinghouse for all other entities, entities like golf courses, hotels and office buildings. McConney testified that each week the accounting staff would run reports on the various entities to determine their respective cash balances. If one of the entities had a surplus of cash, that cash was swept into the DJT account. And if one of those entities had a deficit of cash, then that money would be taken out of the DJT entity to make up for the shortfall. So, the DJT account was really the hub of the wheel with 500 spokes. In short, the DJT account was an enterprise. Listen carefully when the judge defines \"enterprise\". It can be any entity of one or more persons, public or private, engaged in business, commercial or professional activity. And it's barely worth mentioning it because it's so obvious, because the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is also an organization entity under that Organization. You saw all the charts of all the entities and how they went into the Trust. When Mr. Trump became President, all the other entities were dumped into the Trust. The Trust had its own General Ledger, like the other 498 entities. And whatever theoretical separation the Defense Counsel tried to claim that the lawyers put in place when the Mr. Trump became President, he was still the beneficial owner of everything in The Trust. New York is the business capital of the world. Whether you're a private enterprise or a public enterprise, you have an obligation to keep proper books and business records. This isn't an obligation to your owners or investors or shareholders. It's an obligation to the State of New York. Among other reasons, the information contained in these false records are reviewed. In this case, they're reviewed by tax professionals when it came time to do tax returns. But, your business' books are also important for Government Regulators and Election Regulators, and they're important for other companies or vendors with whom you do business. And in New York State, bottom line, you cannot lie in your business records. And this is what this case is really about at its core: cheating in the Defendant's books, just like hundreds of other cases that have come before."

    "text": "A little longer? Good. Let's get back to the coverup. The Defendant wasn't trying to just engage in damage control in the media and with the FEC. He was also trying to keep a lid on the witnesses who were in a position to reveal the truth. On April 9, 2018, the FBI executed search warrants at Cohen's home, office, and hotel room. Among other things, they were seeking evidence related to campaign finance violations stemming from McDougal's and Daniels' payoffs. That same day, if you remember, the FBI came and took Pecker's phone and Howard's phone. Whatever else you think about Michael Cohen, it's clear he was the Defendant's fixer. Like all fixers, Cohen knew where the bodies were buried, and it was essential to keep him loyal. Within days of the FBI raid, then-President Trump spoke on the phone with Cohen and told him: \"Don't worry. I'm the President of the United States. There is nothing here. Everything is going to be okay. Stay tough. You are going to be okay.\" And, as time went on, Cohen received messages from others who reached out to say, in substance, The Boss loves you and has your back. And Mr. Trump publicly supported Cohen, telegraphing to him the importance of staying on message. On April 21, 2018, less than two weeks after the raid, the Defendant posted the following Tweet. He talks about how the media -- it's a three-part Tweet. I won't read the whole thing. He talks about how \"the media are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip.\" He refers to Michael Cohen as \"Michael\", and he says he's \"a fine person, with a wonderful family who I have always liked and respected.\" And he adds in a very targeted way, \"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble. Sorry. I don't see Michael doing that.\" Cohen told you he interpreted this Tweet the way anyone would, as a way that Mr. Trump was communicating with him, without picking up the phone directly at this point, to send him the message: Stay in the fold. Don't flip. And it reinforced Cohen's loyalty, at least for a while. You've got to remember, the Defendant was also paying Cohen's legal bills at the time, which was another inducement to remain in the Trump camp. And around the same time, Cohen met with attorney Robert Costello to discuss the possibility of retaining him. And Costello billed himself as having close ties to Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and that Costello had opened up a back channel of communication with President Trump, which was critical to maintain. And, initially, Cohen saw Costello as a conduit to the President, a way he could get the lay of the land, so he could weigh his options. But, Cohen never really trusted Costello. Can you really blame him? You saw Costello testify. Cohen was concerned that anything he said would get back to the Defendant, and he wasn't about to tell Costello the truth about what he knew about the Defendant's involvement. Here's an email from Costello to Cohen sent the exact same day of the Defendant's Tweet we just saw, the three-part Tweet about how he doesn't see Michael Cohen flipping. I won't read the entire email. Parts of it. \"I spoke with Rudy. Very, very positive. You are loved. They are in our corner. Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained. He called it crucial and noted how reassured they were that they had someone like me whom Rudy has known for so many years in this role. Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places. P.S. Some very positive comments about you from the White House. Rudy noted how that followed my chat with him last night.\" That meaning, the \"followed\" the \"chat with him\", was a Tweet President Trump sent the night before; and that's clear that's what Costello was telling him. Costello was able to use his back channels to get Trump to get back to him. When Costello testified here at trial, he told you, under oath, that he was acting exclusively in Mr. Cohen's best interests, that he didn't care at all about the Defendant's interests, the only interests he was serving was Michael Cohen's. That was just a bold-faced lie. In a shocking departure from his ethical obligations as a lawyer, Costello wrote an email to his partner, which actually says in black and white: \"Our issue is to get Cohen on the right page, without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the President. In my opinion, this is the clear correct strategy.\" Cohen wasn't playing Costello. Costello was playing Cohen. And Costello's testimony before you was a transparent effort to come up with something, anything, to help this Defendant. But, he didn't. He displayed nothing but disdain for this Court and proper decorum. And his demeanor on the stand is something that you can take into account, that's a fact, when you are assessing his credibility. The judge will tell you, you can consider the manner in which a witness testifies. In mid-June of 2018, sensing that Costello's loyalties were, to say the least, divided, Cohen began distancing himself from Costello. On June 14, 2018, Costello emailed Cohen with a link to a YouTube video, and the subject line: Giuliani on the possibility of Cohen cooperating Mueller probe. Here's an email from Costello to Cohen sent June 14th. I won't read the whole email. It's in evidence as People's 208. \"You are believing the narrative promoted by the left-wing media. Many of them are already writing that you are cooperating. This strategy has been consistent from the start to put pressure on you into believing that you are alone, that everyone you knew before is distancing themselves from you and you are being thrown under the bus. The whole objective of this exercise by the Southern District of New York is to drain you, emotionally and financially, until you reach a point that you see them as your only means to salvation. I told you that the very first day I met you.\" \"I told you that the very first day I met you.\" That's not what he testified to. They want you to cave. They want you to fail. They do not want you to persevere and succeed. The subtext here could not be clearer:  Do not flip. Do not talk. Do not cooperate. Stay loyal. And the following week, Costello realized by now that he's losing control of Cohen, but he was desperate to serve his true master, the Defendant. And he sent this email to his partner: \"Cohen has to know this, yet he continues to slow play us and the President. Is he totally nuts? What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet.\" So much for acting solely in Cohen's best interests. Yet, that's what Mr. Costello told you. But, for a while, President Trump's strategy worked because even after he had fully reimbursed Cohen for the unlawful campaign contribution, Cohen continued to deny wrongdoing. For several months he continued to lie for the Defendant. It's a little disingenuous for the Defense to argue that you shouldn't believe anything Cohen says about the Defendant because he previously denied paying Daniels at all or because he issued a misleading statement, claim that he paid her with his own personal funds. Those lies were told at the Defendant's direction and at his behest and for his benefit. So, using them now to undermine Cohen, to undermine his credibility takes, again, chutzpah. It's blaming the messenger for the Defendant's own message. Interestingly, though, Cohen decided he couldn't tow the party line anymore. The costs were just too great. And he decided, as I said earlier, his loyalty to his family was more important. And he did exactly what the Defendant had been so desperate to get him not to do; he flipped. On August 21, 2018, Cohen pled guilty to, among other things, making an excessive campaign contribution in violation of FECA in connection with the Daniels matter. And this is from Cohen's testimony: \"Question: And on August 21, 2018, did you plead guilty to one count of making an excessive campaign contribution in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act?\""

And Trump immediately went on the attack, an attack that continues to this day. The very next morning after Cohen pled guilty -- and the plea was widely reported -- the Defendant took to Twitter again. \"If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen.\" This is the day after he pled guilty. Less than an hour later, another Tweet that's favorable about Paul Manafort. \"Unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break, make up stories in order to get a deal. Such respect for a brave man.\" These tweets were not only designed to punish Cohen. They were designed to send a clear message to other potential witnesses: Cooperate, and you will face the wrath of Donald Trump."

    "text": "That's another part of the Defendant's philosophy that he describes in his thoughts. These excerpts are from Trump: How to Get Rich. The chapter title is Sometimes You Still Have to Screw Them. \"One. For many years I've said that if someone screws you, screw them back. Two. When somebody hurts you, just go after them as viciously and as violently as you can. Like it says in the bible, an eye for an eye.\" These next few excerpts are from Think Big: Make It Happen in Life: \"My motto is: Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades. When you are wronged, go after those people because it is a good feeling and because other people will see you doing it. Getting even is not always a personal thing. It's just a part of doing business.\" \"I can't stomach the disloyalty. This woman was very disloyal, and now I go out of my way to make her life miserable.\" Taking these excerpts together, it is clear that part of the Defendant's strategy in disparaging witnesses against him is to discourage other witnesses from coming forward. During the month of March of 2023, this case was being presented to the Grand Jury. Stormy Daniels testified on March 15, 2023. She participated in a Zoom interview with members of the DA's Office. That same day, Mr. Trump publicly attacked Stormy Daniels in connection with what he perceived to be her cooperation in this case. In this post on Truth Social, he called her, first of all, \"Horseface\". He denied having seen her since he took a photo with her on a golf course. He calls her a \"SleazeBag\". And he refers to Cohen as \"a convicted liar\" and \"jailbird\". And like Stormy Daniels, Cohen, he testified in the Grand Jury March 13th, two days before these remarks. The Defendant is clearly trying to pressure Daniels and Cohen to back off. There's something else about this post that you should see. We know it's a lie. Even Rhona Graff, Mr. Trump's loyal assistant for decades, testified Daniels was at Trump Tower to meet the Defendant on one occasion and that she kept Daniels' phone number among Trump's contacts; as Ms. Daniels testified. And we actually put into evidence contacts from her phone for both Ms. Graff and Mr. Schiller. Ask yourselves:  Why did the Defendant lie about this, and why did he do it while the Grand Jury was considering charges in this case? People lie for a reason. And if the relationship between the Defendant and Stormy Daniels were purely a business relationship, as the Defense has claimed, what would be the need for the Defendant having to deny having any contact with her other than on that golf course? Shortly after the indictment was unsealed in this case, on March 13, 2018, the Defendant sued Stormy Daniels for half a million dollars. And the lawsuit included claims related to Cohen's testimony in the Grand Jury. Now, yes, the Defendant ultimately abandoned that lawsuit. But the fact that he would file such a vexatious and punitive lawsuit in the first place show the lengths he would go to punish those who would dare to deny him. He filed a lawsuit against Stormy Daniels in Florida, seeking to receive defamation fees, legal fees. This lawsuit threatens to bankrupt her. True to the promises in his book, the Defendant wanted everyone to see the cost of taking him on. In August of 2023, the Defendant made another post along the same lines to anyone who would collude, considering colluding, or might consider in the future, in all caps: \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" It's not too hard to understand what that means. And it's not just Mr. Trump himself. It's the throngs of his followers who interpret such Tweets as a call to arms."

    "text": "Thank you. Thanks for sticking with me. So, yesterday -- earlier today, it feels like yesterday, I mentioned that one of the three things that we have to prove in this case is that the defendant made or caused false business records, and that he did so with the intent to defraud. We have gone through a ton of evidence showing his involvement at every step. But, it is easy to lose sight of the details of the transactions and all the back and forth among all the players who are involved. So, I just want to quickly highlight some of the evidence of the defendant's direct involvement throughout both the election conspiracy and the creation of the false business records. And you know it all began in that Trump Tower meeting. I am not going to go back through it all. But, keep in mind this was not Pecker dealing with Cohen as a conduit. This was Cohen as Mr. Trump's fixer being present for a meeting between Pecker and Mr. Trump. Cohen was the one that Pecker would notify if AMI came across a story to purchase and kill, but Trump was the one doing the yes'ing. And Mr. Trump was the one appointing Cohen as the middle man. And the evidence was that Mr. Trump was personally very happy with the results, the articles were previewed from Mr. Pecker. As you know, both puff pieces and the hit pieces. Cohen explained how he immediately showed the material to Mr. Trump who thought the articles were fantastic and unbelievable. And Hope Hicks testified that she overheard Mr. Trump praising Pecker for a story involving a photo of Ted Cruz's father, Lee Harvey Oswald. She heard Mr. Trump telling Mr. Pecker that stories about the one about Dr. Carson's medical malpractice were Pulitzer worthy. So, there was overwhelming evidence that Mr. Trump also directed the catch and kill component of the Trump Tower agreements. On June 16th, Howard texts Cohen about the date for the upcoming meeting between Howard and McDougal. And within 40 minutes of that, Cohen is texting Keith Schiller to get in touch with Mr. Trump. And within seconds of that exchange, Cohen speaks with Mr. Trump directly. Not even through Schiller. Cohen testified that he informed Mr. Trump about the situation. He always reported developments like this to Mr. Trump, or it could cost him his job. Like nearly all of what Cohen testified to, his testimony is corroborated by other evidence. You will recall that Pecker testified that after that meeting took place, Mr. Trump personally called Pecker to discuss the McDougal matter. And he explained that the defendant told him that he had spoken to Michael, and that Michael had told him about Karen. So that's corroboration that Michael Cohen is keeping Mr. Trump informed at every step. They went on to discuss, that is, Pecker and Trump when on to discuss whether the defendant should buy the story. And Mr. Trump says, he'll think about it, and he'll have Michael Cohen call you back in a few days with my decision. Michael Cohen is not some rouge actor here. He's acting at the direction of the defendant. And you don't have to take Cohen's word for that. Unless you think that Pecker was lying about this, this conclusively demonstrates that several weeks before the McDougal NDA is signed, the defendant is overtly discussing with Pecker, whether he, the defendant, should purchase her story to make sure it didn't get published. There is no middleman in this conversation. No buffer. And after the deal is signed on August 5th, Pecker is understandably anxious to get his money back because he only purchased the story with the understanding that the defendant would reimburse him. Not Cohen, the defendant. Pecker is so persistent that Cohen actually tapes the defendant discussing the reimbursement. I am certainly not going to play the tape for you again. But, you clearly have Mr. Trump discussing reimbursing AMI for the money they had spent acquiring Ms. McDougal's life rights. The defense just can't get away from this, no matter how hard they try. This is proof outside of Cohen of Mr. Trump's direct involvement in one of the many aspects of this criminal conspiracy. Cohen explained that he'd already spoken to Weisselberg at Trump's direction in order to figure out a way to pay AMI back. And in late September, Cohen formed Resolution Consultants to purchase the McDougal life rights. And what you see reflected here at the top of the screen is a series of encrypted messages and calls among Cohen and Rotstein and Pecker, followed by a seven plus minute call between Cohen and the defendant on September 29th. Followed by the nine minute plus call between Cohen and Pecker. And the very next day Resolution Consultants is formed and both Pecker and Cohen signed the transfer. As for the Stormy Daniels NDA, Cohen explained that he discussed the matter roughly 20 times with Mr. Trump after he learned she had resurfaced. Remember, on October 7th, the Access Hollywood tape was released. On October 8th at 7:39 p.m., Howard asks Rodriguez for the Stormy pitch. At 7:54, Howard and Pecker speak on the phone. At 7:57, Pecker and Cohen speak on the phone. At 8:03, Cohen and Trump speak on the phone. Now, there is just no way, no way, that Cohen wouldn't have told Mr. Donald Trump about Daniels during that phone call. Why won't he have? Cohen said that Mr. Trump was upset to hear that Daniels was back after Cohen and Davidson had successfully gotten that 2011 story removed. And Mr. Trump said, \"Women will hate me. Guys will think it's cool. But this will be a disaster for the campaign.\" During one of their earlier conversations, the defendant told Cohen to delay the deal. Remember that. Try to push it past the election. And that is exactly what Cohen tried to do. Do you think Cohen would have the audacity to take had a chance without the defendant's say so. That he would risk delaying this and maybe the story would come out. And it could make the whole thing come tumbling down. No. Cohen about did that. That strategy of delay. Because that's what the defendant told him to do. At 8:57, Howard and Cohen speak. And at 9:05 p.m., Howard lets Pecker know that he's spoken to Cohen, \"All sorted.\" Both Cohen and Farro testified that on October 13th Cohen completed the paperwork to open a bank account for Resolution Consultants. The night before that, on October 12th, Trump and Pecker had that relatively long conversations. And then at 9:12 a.m. on October 13th, Pecker and Cohen speak via the encrypted app. And 11 minutes later, Cohen emails First Republic from the 26th copyright pantry, right outside Rhona's office, the one that she uses, and she sits right outside Mr. Trump's office. Is this timing all coincidence, every single one of these things? Mr. Donald Trump is being kept abreast of every development. On October 17th, at 4:31 p.m., Davidson pulls out of the Daniels NDA. Around 20 minutes later, Cohen talks to Davidson to try to get the deal back on track. Eight minutes after that, Cohen tries to call the defendant to give him the update. That Daniels has now declared the NDA void. And Cohen explained that he left a voicemail. And the following morning, Melania Trump texts Cohen to call Mr. Trump on his cell, and Cohen responds, \"Of course.\" And Cohen believes that they spoke that day, on October 18th. Look, of course, is it possible to know exactly when every single conversation took place?  But what is clear is that Cohen is trying to reach Mr. Trump immediately after he learns that the Stormy Daniels deal is off. On October 26th, Cohen initiated the wire transfer from the Essential Consultants account to Davidson's account. That's on October 26th. And he explained that Mr. Trump -- that he called Mr. Trump before doing so. Again, the phone records corroborate this. The morning of October 26th at 8:26 a.m., and again at 8:34, Cohen spoke to Mr. Trump. Just stop for a minute to think of the timing of these phone calls. They're absolutely critical. Unlike the call on the 24th, this was the final go ahead. Cohen explained that he was seeking, and he got, final authorization to make the payment. And that explanation makes sense because Cohen wasn't going to layout $130,000 without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump. Here's from the transcript: \"QUESTION:  Did you call Mr. Trump before you went and set up the account to make a transfer? \"ANSWER:  Yes. \"QUESTION:  What, in substance, did you discuss with him on these two calls? \"ANSWER:  I wanted to insure that once again he approved what I was doing because I required approval from him on all of this.\" That's what the sum and substance of the conversation was, laying out exactly what was going to happen and what is being done in order to insure that the story didn't get sold to the Daily Mail or somebody else. \"QUESTION:  Did you let him know that you were going across the street and that you were going to get the account set up and make the payment? \"ANSWER:  Yes, ma'am. \"QUESTION:  Would you have made the payment to Stormy Daniels without getting a signoff from Mr. Trump? \"ANSWER:  No. \"QUESTION:  Why not. \"ANSWER:  Because everything required Mr. Trump's signoff. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\" Cohen had 130,000 reasons to get the defendant's blessing. Pecker told you that Cohen wasn't authorized to buy lunch without the defendant's approval. Davidson also understood that Cohen lacked the authority to approve the deal without Mr. Trump's signoff. That's what Hope Hicks told you as well. Remember, when Mr. Trump tried to play it off like he didn't know, after the Wall Street Journal article came out in January of 2018, he said, \"Isn't it nice that Cohen did this out of the kindness of his heart?\"  She didn't buy it for one minute. She said, that would be out of character for Michael. He wasn't an especially charitable or selfless person. Half an hour after that second call with Trump, Cohen initials the process. He gets the incorporation paperwork from Patty at Delaney at 9:04 a.m. And the timing of these phone calls is just simply too coincidental for Cohen's description of the call to be anything other than accurate. And Cohen's explanation makes sense because it's consistent with both Trump's management style and with Cohen's own persona. On October 28th, Cohen receives the signed NDA and SLA, and those documents establish that David Dennison is Mr. Trump. Cohen let Trump know immediately. He had every incentive to. Again, you see a five minute plus call with him that morning. Cohen testified that he told Donald Trump the matter was completely under control and locked down pursuant to the NDA. And that also rings true; right. Because if Cohen accomplished something for Mr. Trump, he wanted Mr. Trump to know immediately. What possible incentive would Cohen have to not tell Trump what he did for him? On November 4, 2016, as you know, the Wall Street Journal broke the McDougal story, and once again Schiller reaches out to Cohen to see if he could take a call. And Cohen also speak with Davidson. He explained that he was trying to insure that McDougal wasn't going rouge. And, then, once again, at 9:06 p.m., Cohen speaks with Mr. Trump for nearly six minutes on Mr. Schiller's phone. Trump was upset that this would negatively impact his standing with female voters. I know what you are thinking, how do we know that this was really Cohen speaking to Trump and not to Schiller. Well, you need to look at the context, what was going on at the time. Remember that insane flurry of activity that I went through before, I'm not going to go through it again, on November 4th, everyone calling everyone and their mother. It's crazy to think that in the middle of that flurry about this article, that Cohen would have a casual conversations with Schiller in the middle of that media monsoon. And Cohen explained that he detailed for Mr. Trump the efforts that he made to get statements from Howard and Pecker and Davidson. All of the damage control that he had done for his boss. And the following day, Mr. Trump reached out to Pecker. Pecker testified that Trump called him at home. He was livid. He demanded to know how the McDougal story could have gotten out. He accused Pecker of having leaked it. Still more proof if you need it. More proof that the defendant knew about the NDA and was upset because he thought it had been breached four days before the election. Here is something we haven't discussed before. On January 6, 2017, Pecker met with the defendant in Trump Tower. Mr. Trump personally thanked Pecker for handling both the McDougal situation and the doorman story. And, again, if you credit Pecker's testimony, you know, independently of Cohen, that Mr. Trump is both aware of and an appreciative of Pecker's efforts in catching and killing these two stories. So why would the defendant be kept in the dark about the Daniels' NDA? It defies common sense. Trump also invited Pecker to the White House that July for a thank you dinner. Again, to express all of his gratitude for everything that AMI had done to get him elected. In January of 2017, Mr. Cohen was upset about the fact that his bonus had been cut, despite his efforts on his boss's behalf, and about the fact that he still hadn't been paid back. So on January 16th or 17th, Cohen and Weisselberg discussed how Mr. Trump could repay Cohen without being too obvious about it. We have already reviewed the infamous bank statement. The smoking gun with both Cohen and Weisselberg's notes. And after Cohen and Weisselberg from worked out the amount of the payment, but not the repayment schedule, they went into Mr. Trump's office to speak to him. Weisselberg certainly didn't have the authority to approve that kind of money, and he couldn't approve a bonus at all. And he certainly couldn't approve one nickle from the DJT account. And Cohen explained that in this meeting with Trump, Weisselberg said, \"We're going to pay you over 12 months.\" And saying it that way, that made Cohen believe that Weisselberg and Donald Trump had already discussed the repayment schedule. They were running like a frick and frack routine. Rebecca Manochio you will remember testified that Weisselberg and Trump interacted every day. Tarsoff also said they spoke frequently, including during the campaign and the transition period. She told you that Weisselberg ran financial decisions by Mr. Trump before carrying them out. Weisselberg said during the meeting this would be paid out like legal services rendered since Cohen was being given the title of Personal Attorney to the President. It was really a perfect solution. Cohen gets the title he wants and Trump gets the way to disguise the payment as income. If you remember, Cohen said Weisselberg showed this document, People's 35 to Trump. And Weisselberg said in front of Mr. Trump, that they would pay $35,0000 a month, and the actual payments would start in February, not January, because there was too much going on with the transition. Mr. Cohen approved the arrangement and said, \"This is going to be a heck of a ride in D.C.\" And make no mistake, in approving that arrangement, the defendant caused a falsification of business records in his own company. On February 8th, 2017, you will recall Cohen went to the White House to meet with President Trump. You have seen it in his calendar and Westerhout's email and the photo that he took in the briefing room. That is when he Trump asked him if he needed money, and reminded him to deal with Allen Weisselberg and the January and February checks would be forthcoming. And, of course, there is the fact that the defendant personally signed nine of the checks himself. At the time they were attached not only to the check stubs that falsely said retainer, but were stapled to the false invoices. Busy or not, Mr. Trump was not paying these prices for basically no work. As you know, the Wall Street Journal broke the story, the Stormy Daniels payoff, on January 12, 2018, and shortly before that, the journalists reached out to Cohen and Davidson for comment. Cohen tried to circle the wagon. He pressured Davidson to get Daniels to sign the denial. And, of course, he reported his successes back to Trump both as a show of loyalty and because he wanted credit for helping put out the fire. Notwithstanding his efforts, though, shortly thereafter the FEC began an investigation into campaign finance violations. And on February 6, 2018, Cohen texted Maggie Haberman, \"The Big Boss just approved,\" in responding to the FEC complaint and making a statement to the press. And two days later, Cohen released his very misleading statement to the FEC and another to the press, and that statement was approved by President Trump. After Cohen did so, Mr. Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, sent that text to Cohen on an encrypted app to say, \"Client/President Trump, says thank you.\" And the next month McDougal was interviewed by Anderson Cooper. And, again, the defendant called Pecker to express his frustration that once again the NDA that he pushed Pecker to enter into with McDougal was being violated. Pecker testified that Trump said, \"I thought you and he had an Agreement with Karen McDougal that she can't give interviews or be on TV.\" When Pecker explained that he modified the NDA to permit her to speak to the press, Mr. Trump got very agitated and couldn't understand why. As if there was any lingering doubt, this testimony makes plain that Trump was behind the McDougal NDA. Again, totally apart from Michael Cohen. Similarly, Pecker called Trump a few days after Stormy Daniels went on Anderson Cooper, which was just a couple of days after Ms. McDougal went on. And he told Pecker, \"We have an Agreement with Stormy Daniels that she cannot mention my name or do anything like this. And each time she breaches the Agreement, it's a one million dollar penalty.\" That sounds like Mr. Trump was quite familiar with the NDA and the liquidated damages clause, whether or not he actually signed it. And, again, this is exactly what Cohen told you about sharing the successes with the defendant. On April 9th, 2018, as you know, the FBI raided Cohen's home, business and hotel. Cohen testified that he got the call from Trump shortly afterwards telling him not to worry, I'm the President, everything is going to be okay. I'm not going to walk you through all this again. But the message from Mr. Trump is consistent with his public tweets and with Mr. Costello's efforts to dissuade Mr. Cohen from cooperating. On May 3, 2018, Mr. Trump personally tweeted out that the payment to Cohen was a reimbursement for the NDA. Two weeks later, he signed that OGE, Office of Government Ethics form, and again admitted that the payments to Cohen were reimbursements. And as we discussed, because he knew that the payments were really reimbursement, and he knew that disguising the reimbursement as income required him to make or cause false entries in the business records."

    "text": "So, the Defendant convened the Trump Tower meeting that hatched the Election Law conspiracy; talked to Cohen on the phone less than one hour after Howard told Cohen about the meeting among McDougal, Davidson and Howard; called Pecker in late June to discuss whether the Defendant should buy the McDougal story; was recorded on December 6th, discussing how Cohen should reimburse Pecker for purchasing McDougal's life rights; called Cohen the day before the McDougal life rights Agreement was signed to approve it; spoke to Cohen six minutes after Pecker told Cohen that Rodriguez was shopping the Stormy Daniels story again; spoke to Pecker late at night before Pecker told Cohen to shut down the Resolution Consultants account; spoke to Cohen shortly before Davidson backed the Daniels Agreement on May 17th; reached out to Cohen through Melania the following morning; spoke with Cohen twice on October 26th, 30 minutes before initiating the wire transfer process; spoke with Cohen the same day that the Daniels NDA was signed, sealed and delivered. The Defendant spoke with Cohen the day The Wall Street Journal broke the McDougal story and expressed anger at the timing. The Defendant complained to Pecker the next day because he thought the story had been locked down. He met with Pecker two weeks before the inauguration to thank him for catching and killing the Sajudin and McDougal stories. He approved the reimbursements drawn up by Cohen and Weisselberg. He met with Cohen in the Oval Office to finalize the reimbursements. The Defendant personally signed nine of the eleven reimbursement checks by hand; approved the bogus denial Cohen sent to the FEC; and he thanked Cohen through his attorney, Jay Sekulow, for lying on the Defendant's behalf. He complained again to Pecker that both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal had breached their NDAs by going on Anderson Cooper, and he called Pecker separately after each broadcast. He sent a Tweet admitting that the 2017 payments to Cohen were reimbursements, and he signed the Government Ethics Form saying the same thing. Now, that's all overt evidence of Mr. Trump's involvement. But, in addition to that, there's your common sense. And we've already gone through -- I'm not going to go through all the evidence of the Defendant's frugality, his attention to detail, and his insistence on signing his own checks. And you know why he did that. It was important enough to conceal the Daniels payoff, but the Defendant was willing to pay double, despite the fact that goes against everything he believes in. But, another common sense argument surrounds Michael Cohen and his testimony about keeping the Defendant in the loop. The Defense wants you to believe that Cohen went rogue, I guess, that he did all these things to help Mr. Trump without Mr. Trump knowing. But, there are at least three reasons why you shouldn't believe that argument: Number one. As you know, Trump is a micro-manager who was deeply involved in the details of his business and in the details of his campaign, and it's just not in his nature to remain in the dark about the matters that threaten to undermine his campaign. Particularly when you see from all his tweets and rally appearances, he's almost obsessed by these allegations on women and their impact on female voters. And you see how involved the Defendant was in this conspiracy. He was the one asking Pecker for help with the campaign. He was personally viewing the articles. He was actively pushing the cash aspect of the Agreement. You see how involved the Defendant was in the payoff to the women, from Pecker's testimony, to Cohen's testimony, to the recorded conversation about different ways to reimburse Pecker. Even all of this evidence about the Defendant's participation in the conspiracy to influence the election and his general approach to business and life. It's just inconceivable that he would be so involved in buying these women's silence and then suddenly stick his head in the sand when it came to Cohen's reimbursement. Second. Cohen was and is a self-promoter. It simply defies all common sense to think that he would undertake these Herculean efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump and then keep them to himself. Fixers like him may try not to leave a paper trail to lead to their principal, but they sure as heck want the principal to know. You know from Pecker that Cohen had told Mr. Trump about the Sajudin and McDougal deals, and Trump thanked Pecker for his roles in those deals. So, why would Cohen tell Mr. Trump about the deals that AMI funded, but not the deals that he, himself, laid out his own money for? Does that make any sense to you? See, Boss, look how much I love you. I took money out of my own home equity line of credit. That's exactly what Hope Hicks tells you that Cohen would have done. And the third reason is because the Defendant was the beneficiary of this entire scheme. He was the one trying to get elected. He was the one who stood to gain the most by silencing these women and by making sure to repay Cohen in a way that didn't make it obvious. He is the only one who would care about creating the false business records to conceal the Daniels payoff. Cohen would have said: Just give me my $130,000 back so I can stick it back into the home equity line before my wife notices it's gone. Why did he need to go through all this rigamarole to get paid back? The falsifying business records benefited one person and one person only, and that's the Defendant. As we've discussed, after the summation -- if it ever ends -- the judge will give you the law that pertains to this case. One concept the judge will explain is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", what it is and what it is not. We don't have to prove guilt to a mathematical certainty or beyond any conceivable doubt. That's not possible in human affairs. Nothing is 100 percent certain. Again, you should be guided by your common sense and a full and fair evaluation of the evidence. Don't accept the Defendant's invitation to accept each piece of evidence in a vacuum. Look at the evidence in a whole. When you do, you will see that the People have proven this case beyond all reasonable doubt. Please listen carefully to when the judge defines \"reasonable doubt\" for you. I know it seems like ages ago. During jury selection, we discussed the concept of accessorial liability or acting in concert and how the law provides when two or more people act to commit a crime, each may be criminally liable for the acts of the others. The judge will explain the law about this. I won't get into any details. In order for Mr. Trump to be responsible for others' actions, he has to have the intent to defraud, and he has to have solicited, requested, or intentionally aided others in the commission of the offense. Like the example that we all discussed in jury selection of the hitman, the husband who hires the hitman. The husband doesn't actually pull the trigger"

No one is saying the Defendant actually got behind a computer and typed in the false vouchers or stamped the false invoices or printed the false checks. But, he set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of the false business records. The Defendant caused the creation of the false business records when he approved the reimbursement scheme for the Stormy Daniels payoff, and he knew that the reimbursements would be processed in exactly the same way that The Trump Organization had long processed such payments, because he had always been immersed in those details by choice. So, he acted in concert to create the false entries in the vouchers and the invoices. And he acted in concert to create the false checks and check stubs from The Trust. And he, personally, signed the false DJT checks himself. So, this is kind of a no-brainer in this case. We've also discussed the meaning of \"enterprise\" and how the DJT entity, The Trust, and The Trump Organization itself all satisfy that very broad definition. And, as I said before, this chart is kind of a handy summary of each of the false business records and which count of the indictment they correspond to. As to the \"intent to defraud\", the judge will explain to you what \"intent\" means: conscious objective or purpose. Remember in jury selection, we spoke about \"intent\" and how we can't actually get into someone's heads and read their minds. But, juries determine intent all the time. Did the suspect shoot at someone with the intent to kill, or did he shoot at someone with the intent to scare? Well, in other words, to answer that, you have to look at the surrounding facts or circumstances. So, we have to prove, first, that the Defendant had an intent to commit fraud. The judge will explain that intent to defraud does not require --"

There is ample evidence of the Defendant's intent to defraud, whether that's defrauding regulators or the voting public. These weren't an accident or oversight. They were designed to obscure the Election Law, including the repayment to Cohen for the Daniels NDA. I'm not going to bore you by going through all that evidence again. The intent that we need to prove included the intent to commit, aid or conceal another crime, as I said. And that doesn't mean that he actually committed, aided or concealed; just that he had that intent. So, what crime do we suggest that he intended to commit, aid or conceal? The answers is: New York City Election Law. Again, the judge will define that crime for you. I'm not going to do that. You need two or more people conspiring to promote or prevent the election, as we've talked about, of any public officer by unlawful means, and at least one conspirator has to act on that conspiracy. So, as to the conspiracy to promote or prevent the election, we're basically beating a dead horse here. You've seen a mountain of evidence that proves that the Defendant, Pecker, Cohen, and Howard conspired to influence the 2016 Presidential election. That was the whole purpose of the Trump Tower meeting, to get AMI to help the Defendant win the election. As to the \"unlawful means\", you don't have to agree on what those unlawful means are, so long as you agree that there was an intent to conspire to promote the Defendant's election by any unlawful means. The Defendant's intent to defraud included an intent to aid, conceal or commit election fraud by any means necessary, lawful and unlawful. The first may be most obvious. Unlawful intention includes potential Federal finance violations known as FECA violations. The co-conspirators in this case committed several FECA violations along the way --"

For McDougal and Sajudin, the FECA violations occurred when Pecker made, and the campaign gladly accepted, a corporate campaign contribution. Corporations are not allowed to donate to candidates. Period. So, when AMI spent $150,000 or $125,000 to purchase the McDougal life rights, it made a campaign contribution. And Pecker told you exactly that. And, as he told you, his principal purpose in entering into that NDA with McDougal was to suppress her story, so as to prevent it from influencing the election. He also told you he was aware at the time that expenditures by corporations made for the purpose of influencing an election at the request of a candidate are unlawful. He told you he only entered into the NDA with the assurance that Trump would reimburse him."

    "text": "(Continued.)  We've discussed ad nauseum, I'm sorry, how AMI was acting way outside the scope of a normal, legitimate press function -- even for tabloid journalism. Pecker put the campaign first -- to the point where he was willing to sacrifice magazine sales to serve the Defendant. That was not business as usual by any stretch, and the press exemption does not apply here. Now, of course, in the case of Stormy Daniels -- there is no press exception any way -- but, it has zero applicability whatsoever here because Stormy Daniels is not a press entity. Game over. For the Daniels payoff, the FECA violation comes from Cohen making and the Defendant accepting excessive campaign contribution. The Judge will tell you that in 2016, individuals were only permitted to contribute $2,700 to a particular campaign. And, as the Judge will explain, paying a candidate's expenses for them counts as a contribution to that candidate. Cohen's payments to Daniels, in coordination with the Defendant, to keep her quiet for the purpose of influencing the election was a campaign contribution that massively exceeded the $2,700 limit. Defense counsel wants you to think that Cohen's real motivation was protecting Trump's marriage or protecting Trump's family from embarrassment. They spent so much time on that argument because, under the law, paying a candidate's expenses is not a campaign contribution if Cohen would have made the payment \"irrespective of the candidacy.\" But, you don't have to spend any time on that one either, because no one told you he made the Daniels payoff because of the election. And, you have seen a ton of evidence that this payoff was driven by the Defendant's concerns about the potential impact of the Daniels story on the election. The Defendant wanted to squash the story for the same reason he wanted to squash the McDougal story, and the Sajudin story, to avoid the harm these stories might cause to his election prospects. Even more so, because the Daniels story surfaced in the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape and the crisis it caused. Her story would have, as we said earlier, undermined the strategy completely of playing off this tape as only words. Remember, Daniels had been out there for a decade, and nobody once thought it was important to buy her life rights to keep her from talking -- to protect the Defendant's family. That didn't happen until two weeks before the election. And when the story finally broke, in 2018, the Defendant explicitly told Ms. Hicks that it's better that the story came out now than before the election. There is just no rational argument that Cohen's payment to Daniels was made if not for the election, would have been made if not for the election. Other options you can consider as unlawful means include any other one of the unlawful business records that contribute to the effort to promote or prevent the Defendant's election. They include Cohen's bank opening records at First Republic Bank for both Resolution Consultants and Essential Consultants; the bank paperwork for the wire transfer to Keith Davidson; the phony invoice from Daniel Rotstein at IAS to Essential Consultants, billing $125,000 as a flat fee for services rendered, and it was really for McDougal's life rights; and the 1099s issued to Cohen by both the DJT entity and The Trust, which are falsely -- which falsely described the $420,000 payments as compensation, rather than reimbursement for expenses. And those 1099s also violated City and State and Federal Tax Law, yet another unlawful means. Listen carefully to the Judge's instructions. It's a crime to willfully create false tax forms even if they don't result in any underpayment of taxes. Mr. Blanche has suggested that if the events that took place after the election can't be part of the conspiracy to promote that election, it doesn't make any sense at all. The Defendant -- the Defendant still had an incentive to keep the conspiracy quiet. The Defendant's post-election steps to conceal his pre-election activity is part of the same conspiracy. The Defendant was still actively trying to prevent his catch-and-kill scheme from going public. That's why he had Cohen issue the false denials in 2018. He still cared. That's why he called Pecker to complain, after both McDougal and Daniels appeared on Anderson Cooper. He considered those appearances breaches of the NDA. He had every reason to continue to conceal his election fraud. And, second, Miss Cohen told you at the end of -- as of 2017, rather, the Defendant had already announced an intention to run for President again. Any single one of the unlawful means I just mentioned, any one of the three FECA violations, any one of the other false business records I just described, or the City, State or Federal Tax Law violations, any single one of those unlawful means is enough for you to conclude that the Trump Tower conspiracy violated New York State Election Law. The evidence powerfully supports the conclusion that all these steps are unlawful. But, just one is enough. And, as the Judge will tell you, you don't have to agree on which unlawful means were involved. The Defendant's intent to defraud in this case cannot be any clearer. How easy would it have been for the Defendant to just pay Stormy Daniels directly? Why not just do that?  One single transaction. Instead, the Defendant, Weisselberg and Cohen devised this elaborate scheme, requiring the involvement of at least ten other people, a series of monthly transactions, secret FedEx packages back and forth. That's a whole lot of time, thought and energy to conceal the truth. The Defendant used his own business records as the vehicle to disguise the reimbursement because he didn't want anyone finding out about the conspiracy to corrupt the election. Everything Mr. Trump and his cohorts did in this case was cloaked in lies. Lies in the DJT and Trust business records themselves. Lies in the phony invoice from IAS about a flat fee. Lies in the bank account opening documents about the true nature of those accounts. Lies in the bank paperwork for the wire transfer. Lies in the 1099s. Pseudonyms, shell companies, encrypted apps, a paper lease HELOC to fund the deal. The Defendant refused to use email to avoid leaving a paper trail; misleading and an outright false denial about Pecker, Davidson, Daniels, Cohen and his lawyer, all in a last ditch effort to prevent the truth from coming out. The name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man who benefitted most, the Defendant, former-President Donald Trump. And I, too, want to take a moment to thank you. And I realize that this could be a frustrating case. It has gone on a while. And you have really been a remarkable group in terms of, I have never seen a jury here exactly on time every day. And I think this has been a really long summation, and so I apologize for trading brevity for thoroughness, but we only get one shot at this. And, without jurors like you, willing to give up their time, the system doesn't work. So, the Defendant has the Constitutional right to a fair trial. He has the right to put the People, us, to our burden and make them prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. That right doesn't depend on the strength of the case. We don't say, well, you have the right to a trial, but not if the case against you is so powerful."

2 Q. What did you understand the relationship between
3 Michael Cohen and the campaign to be?
4 A. I thought that —— I am going to say it the best way I
5 can. Michael was physically there in every aspect of whatever
6 the campaign was working on, at least at the Trump Organization,
7 at the Trump Tower. He was physically there where the offices
8 were.
9 I thought, probably, he would have heard things. He
10 wasn't part of the campaign, but I think he may have heard
11 things informally, or he injected himself into it. He said it
12 was informal, that's what I thought because he said he wasn't
13 part of the campaign.
14 Q. When you say "he injected himself into it," what do you
15 mean?
16 A. If there were issues. For example, let's say that ——
17 let's go back to Ted Cruz as an example. So he is physically in
18 that environment, and if he heard —— I don't know if he heard it
19 from Mr. Trump or if he heard it from another person within the
20 campaign or someone else, that there are issues about Ted Cruz
21 and we want this negative article to be written, I would only
22 work with Michael, so I don't know who else he spoke to. That's
23 what I was trying to say.
24 Q. Okay.

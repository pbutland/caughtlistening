9 me, was $8 million.
10 And I said, "No. I don't believe there was an offer for
11 $8 million. It's my understanding that she doesn't want her
12 story published. And I think that the story should be
13 purchased. And I believe that you should buy it."
14 And Mr. Trump said to me, he said, "Look, everything" —— he
15 says, "I don't buy any stories." And he said that, "Any time
16 you do anything like this, it always gets out."

18 take this story off the market."
19 And he said, "Let me think about it, and I'll have Michael
20 Cohen call you back in a few days.”

23 with Donald Trump.
24 But, I want to go back to something you said before, which
25 is you said that you dispatched Dylan Howard to go interview

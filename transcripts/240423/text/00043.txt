Page 980
1 THE COURT: Okay. So calling it a repost and
2 suggesting that because somebody else wrote it and then
3 miraculously it appears in your client's account that,
4 therefore, your client can wash his hands of it?

10 If it's unambiguously a willful violation of the
11 Gag Order to take a news article that appears in whatever

15 when he was reposting these things, he was not violating the
16 Gag Order?
17 MR. BLANCHE: Correct.
18 THE COURT: So how do I know that that's his
19 position, because you are telling me?
20 MR. BLANCHE: Well, your Honor, 1 think that ——
21 THE COURT: Are you testifying under oath that
22 that's his position?
23 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I'm not testifying under
24 oath, I'm making argument, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Well, you know, it's your client's

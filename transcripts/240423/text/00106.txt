1 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes .
2 THE COURT: This is something that we need to move
3 on moving forward.
4 I do agree with the People's assertions that they
5 are required to prove that there was an intent to commit
6 another crime.
7 And in this case the Court has given the People
8 permission to pursue three different theories of that.
9 So long as the People can establish that the
10 testimony that is being elicited does advance one of those
11 three theories, I think it's fine, I think it's acceptable.
12 MR. BOVE: Just so I understand it, when you say
13 "advance," you mean the otherwise inadmissible hearsay
14 at issue, to further the predicate that we're talking
15 about?
16 THE COURT: It has to be viewed in context. The
17 one statement that is made may not move the ball, but if
18 that one statement in the context of everything else does,
19 then it would be admissible.
20 Let's take a brief recess.

1 original Agreement? What are the ways in which it amended it?
2 I'm going to ask you to walk us through —— maybe even read
3 Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
4 A "Paragraph 1. AMI shall pay Source the payment set
5 forth in the Agreement within five days of the receipt of this
6 Amendment signed by Source."
7 So, we paid him the $30,000 within —— by —— the Agreement,
8 five days from when the Agreement was signed.
9 Q Let me stop you before we move on to the next
10 paragraph.
11 Is it unusual to pay a source before the story is run?
12 A Yes. It is.
13 Q Why did you do that in this case? Why amend the
14 Agreement in this way?
15 A Dylan finished the vetting of the story, and we hired
16 a private investigator. We sent reporters out to where,
17 supposedly, the illegitimate child was. And we discovered that
18 it was absolutely, 1,000 percent untrue.
19 Q So, why are you paying $30,000 for an untrue story?
20 A Because —— because the article says that if the story
21 got out to another publication or another media outlet, it
22 would have been very embarrassing to the campaign.
23 Q So, this was a way to lock it up?
24 A That's correct.
25 Q Okay.

1 MR. STEINGLASS: I am sorry, one thing more I will
2 say, I don't mean to interrupt you. To finish my thought,
3 Bannon's name is all over the exhibits and the discovery
4 that we provided to counsel. So even though we never
5 specifically say there is a view of the evidence that he
6 could be considered a coâ€”conspirator in this aspect of the
7 conspiracy, it is not like this is the first time they're
8 hearing his name.
9 THE COURT: Yes .
10 MR. BOVE: I think there are about 11 million
11 pages of discovery, so the fact that somebody's name
12 appeared in those pages, I'm not sure that puts anybody on
13 notice that hearsay from that person as a declarant at
14 this trial is going to be elicited.
15 There is no misperception on this side about the
16 predicate that Mr. Steinglass just talked about.
17 I think what the issue is, that the existence of a
18 conspiracy argument is not the sole requirement for the
19 hearsay exception we're talking about.
20 The statement that is being offered also has to
21 further the conspiracy at issue.
22 I don't think there is any basis for a conclusion
23 that what was just elicited from Mr. Pecker regarding
24 Mr. Bannon is furthering the conspiracy that is alleged as
25 the predicate to the charges in the indictment. What that

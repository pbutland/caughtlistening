Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 940
1 this proceeding, I am handing a copy to the Court and a
2 copy to counsel.
3 There are also four additional documents that I
4 may refer to in there separately. I would also note that
5 there is a 9A.
6 So one of the posts, post number 9, Exhibit 9, is
7 the landing page of the Truth Social post which is a
8 newspaper article that the defendant posted. 9A is sort of
9 a better version of that article which is what you would
10 see if you clicked on that article in Truth Social. It
11 would blow it up into a better printout so that it is
12 readable.
13 Judge, each of the 10 posts that I just handed
14 the Court and counsel violate the order restricting
15 extrajudicial statements that this Court issued on April
16 1st. That order amended the Court's initial order on March
17 26th of 2024.
18 Eight of the violative posts were on the
19 defendant's Truth Social account at Real Donald Trump. Two
20 of the posts were on his official campaign website Donald
21 J. Trump dot com. Each of them violates the Court's April
22 lst order which is a lawful order of this Court.
23 In that order the Court found that the types of
24 extrajudicial statements at issue pose a very real threat
25 to the integrity of the judicial proceedings by

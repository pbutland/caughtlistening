1 about Mr. Trump fathering an illegitimate child with his
2 housekeeper?
3 A I immediately called Michael Cohen. And I described to
4 him exactly what I was told by Dylan. And I —— in addition, I
5 also gave him the name. I gave him Dino's name. And I gave him
6 the name of the housekeeper in the penthouse. And I asked him
7 to verify that, first with the Trump Organization Payroll, to
8 see actually —— if they were actually there during this period
9 of time or not.
10 And immediately, Michael Cohen said to me, he says,
11 "Absolutely not true." He says, "But I'll check it out."
12 Q When he said, "Absolutely not true," did you take that
13 to mean that he was denying that Mr. Trump had, in fact,
14 fathered a child with his housekeeper?
15 A That's correct.
16 Q Now, why upon learning of this story did you reach out
17 to Michael Cohen in the first place?
18 A In August, we had a —— we had our meeting in August,
19 we had our agreement that anything that I heard in the
20 marketplace that was going to be negative to Trump —— to
21 Mr. Trump or his family or the campaign, I would notify Michael
22 Cohen immediately.
23 Q So, this was part of the agreement that you had made?
24 A Yes.
25 Q How did you leave it with Michael Cohen after that

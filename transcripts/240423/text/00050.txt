Hearing — Mr. Blanche
Page 987
1 talked about, the President should not be held in contempt.
2 If anything, the Court should make crystal clear what it
3 means with the reposts.
4 And to the extent that your Honor views the posts
5 about Mr. Cohen and the system as being too close to the
6 line, tell President Trump, tell me, and we will make sure
7 that it's not violated.
8 THE COURT: As far as the whole distinction between
9 reposts, you have stated it's ambiguous, you stated you
10 didn't know, but again I hate to come back to this, but you
11 are not offering me anything to support your argument.
12 MR. BLANCHE: But, your Honor ——
13 THE COURT: I was not done.
14 You are not giving me anything to hang my hat on to
15 say, yeah, you're right, the reposts, that was unambiguous,
16 but as I've heard before, suppose someone outside has a
17 placard, right, someone outside is walking around with a
18 placard and it says some horrible, horrible things, is it
19 your position that if your client were to grab that placard
20 and walk around with it and it said terrible, terrible
21 things about the jury, that he has done nothing wrong
22 because he didn't write that post or he didn't write that
23 placard, therefore, he's absolved from any blame?
24 Is that what you're saying?
25 MR. BLANCHE: It is nothing like what I'm saying,

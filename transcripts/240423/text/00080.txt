7 A Yes, that's correct.
8 Q Can you explain to the jury what you mean by that?
9 A When I'm saying mutually beneficial is in writing

11 writing negative stories about his opponents is only going to

13 other tabloids.
14 So for me that was my benefit, and then in doing what —— in
15 publishing these type of stories was also going to benefit his
16 campaign.
17 So that's where I was saying that we were both mutually,
18 both parties were benefiting from it.

1 misdemeanor."
2 So while it's true that there is no conspiracy in
3 the second degree charge on the indictment, it is not true
4 that a conspiracy has not always been alleged to be part of
5 this case.
6 The entire case is predicated on the idea that
7 there was a conspiracy to influence the election in 2016.
8 Mr. Bove may interpret some of the evidence in a
9 way that is different from the way that we interpret it,
10 but that's what the jury's role is, to interpret what the
11 nature and scope of that conspiracy was. This is evidence
12 that will aid them in making that determination.
13 THE COURT: So I agree with what you are saying,
14 Mr. Steinglass. My concern is, did you give any notice
15 that you intended to elicit this type of information and
16 ask these type of questions from this witness about
17 Mr. Bannon?
18 MR. STEINGLASS: No, I don't think that we did.
19 Although, I am not sure that there is a requirement that we
20 do so.
21 That being said, I think this issue will come up
22 with other testimony more so and we can stop asking
23 questions about Stephen Bannon and his involvement in this
24 conspiracy.
25 THE COURT: Since we're talking about it now ——

1 MR. STEINGLASS: So, several things.
2 First of all, part of what we will be eliciting
3 here is what Stephen Bannon asked the witness to do. The
4 question is not hearsay. It's not a statement that is

9 back into it. This may be moot. I do see this coming up.
10 Counsel said it yesterday in the opening, and

24 unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon by one or
25 more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of a

Hearing — Mr. Conroy
Page 957
1 specific, separate attacks on two witnesses and by
2 attacking prospective jurors or juror, the defendant is
3 nothing less than knowingly and willfully, that is
4 intentionally, breaching the crystal clear, unequivocal
5 lines set by this Court in the April 1st order to protect
6 the integrity of this proceeding.
7 I am just going to talk a little bit about
8 another argument that the defendant made in his papers
9 where he claims that what he calls, reposts, are not his
10 statements.
11 In fact, some of his most dangerous statements,
12 including one we brought to the Court's attention as early
13 as arraignments last year, that photo of the defendant
14 holding the bat at the head of the District Attorney, are
15 what he wants to carve out of the order by calling them
16 reposts. That flies in the face of common sense and I am
17 going to draw an analogy which is not perfect but I think
18 is helpful.
19 New York Defamation Law has made clear for over a
20 hundred years that one who repeats or otherwise republishes
21 a defamatory matter is subject to liability as if he had
22 originally published it.
23 That's Geraci versus Probst, 15 New York 3rd 336.
24 And I can hand up copies if you like. I will do that at
25 the end.

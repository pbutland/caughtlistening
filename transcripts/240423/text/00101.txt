3 MR. BOVE: As I was saying at sidebar, we object
4 to this line of inquiry because what's happening here is
5 the Government is eliciting hearsay statements from Stephen
6 Bannon as a declarant. They're being offered for their
7 truth.
8 There's also been no notice that the Government
9 considers Mr. Bannon to be a co—conspirator in this case.
10 As the Court knows, there is no conspiracy
11 charged in the indictment. Statements by a campaign staff
12 member doing normal campaign work do not further any
13 alleged conspiracy that the People are relying on as a
14 predicate act.
15 And the limiting instruction that you are giving
16 with respect to the newspaper articles could not adequately
17 cure the risk of prejudice when we're talking about
18 testimony from statements like this.
19 It's just very far afield from what the charges
20 are in this case, what has been alleged before this line
21 was elicited about how this conspiracy functioned.
22 And so the reason I asked for the sidebar, it's
23 difficult on a question—by—question basis, other than just
24 continually, we think this whole line is inadmissible.
25 THE COURT: People.

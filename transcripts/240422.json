        "text": "defendant can even be impeached with prior acts or prior bad acts that did not result in a criminal charge and that's Gray citing Sandoval. Indeed, a trial court my exclude such evidence entirely, may alternatively limit inquiry to the mere fact that there has been a prior conviction. It may limit the inquiry to the existence and nature of the prior conviction or it may permit examination to the facts and circumstances underlying the prior conviction. People v. Hayes, 97 New York 2d 203. Thus, even a ruling that permits cross—examination regarding a defendant's entire criminal record does not without more indicate an abuse of discretion. People v. Walker, 83 New York 2d at 458. In short, the ultimate question as to whether to permit such impeachment is a matter that rests with the trial judge who exercises a wide range of discretion in ruling on a Sandoval application. That's People v. Contreras 108 AD 2d 627. Moreover, as far as probative crimes —— withdrawn. Moreover, as far as probative crimes go, the mere similarity of a defendant's prior conviction or prior conduct to one of the crimes charged, does not automatically preclude cross—examination. That's People v. Pavao, P—A—V—A—O, New York 2d 282. That case dealt with violence. The principal was the same. The mere fact that the conduct was similar does not in and of itself preclude going into it. It has long been recognized that a defendant cannot shield himself from impeachment on the basis of frequency of his offense or his tendency to specialize in a particular type of crime. People v. Rahman, R—A—H—M—A—N, 62 AD 2d 968. It is settled law that a criminal defendant who chooses to testify on his own behalf may be cross—examined about any prior criminal, vicious or immoral acts that bear logically on his credibility, including those acts by defendant that did not result, again, in a criminal conviction. This Court is not required to preclude the People from asking about the incidents because they might keep the defendant off the stand. People v. Hayes. The Court of Appeals has stated that the alleged singularity of the defendant's testimony does not require the Court to limit otherwise appropriate impeachment material. In fact, Court's have recognized that if the defendant is the only witness, it may be that much more important that the jury be able to access his credibility accurately. Thus, the possible unavailability of other witnesses may cause the trial court to conclude this factor increases the importance of defendant's credibility. Of course, fairness dictates that the Court must be mindful of the potential prejudice to the prosecution in the fact—finding process denying the jury access to probative evidence of the defendant's credibility. People v. Bennette, B—E—N—N—E—T—T—E, 55 New York 2d at 147. Finally, any perceived unfair prejudice by a permitted inquiry may be alleviated by the Court's careful and specific limiting instructions at the time of cross—examination and, again, during final charge. In fact, the Court in clear and forceful language should instruct the jury that they are to consider the defendant's previous conduct only in assessing his credibility and under no such circumstances are to use his prior conduct as proof that he committed the instant crime, given those precise instructions, which the jurors are presumed to follow, People v. Davis 58 New York 2d 1102, the Court is permitted to reach a Sandoval compromise. Upon applying that law, if defendant takes the stand, the Court will permit the People to inquire into the following six determinations involving four separate proceedings. First, as to the proceeding of People by James v. Trump, index number, 452564, document number 1688, the Court will allow the People to elicit that on February 16, 2024, the defendant was found to have violated Executive Law Section 63 (12) by fraudulently misstating the value of his assets for an economic benefit. The Court ordered the defendant to pay penalties and enjoined the defendant from serving as an officer or director of any New York Corporation for a period of three years. Next, document number 1584, the Court will allow the People to elicit that on October 20, 2023, the defendant violated a court order by failing to remove an untrue, disparaging and personally identifying post about the Court's Principal Law Clerk from the website, Donald J. Trump dot com. The Court fined the defendant $5,000. And the third document from that incident, document number 1598, the Court will allow the People to elicit that on October 25, 2023, the defendant was found to have intentionally violated a court order by making public attacks on the Judge's law clerk, despite two prior court orders not to do so. The Court fined the defendant $10,000. Moving on to the next proceeding, and that would be Carroll v. Trump, 22, CV, 7311, and that would be ECF number 214. The Court will allow the People to elicit that on September 6, 2023, the defendant was found to have defamed E. Jean Carroll in public statements in 2019 by making false statements with actual malice."

        "text": "question by itself is not evidence. It is the question with the answer that is evidence. Sometimes a question will assume, for example, sometimes a question will assume something to be true. You are not, however, to conclude that an assumption in a question is true unless the answer in your judgment confirms it to be true. So you must consider the question and the witness' answer and decide whether you find the answer believable and accurate. Because, again, it is the question with the answer that is the evidence. Next, evidence may come in the form of a stipulation. A stipulation is information which both parties agree to present to the jury as evidence without calling a witness to testify to that information. Thus, evidence may come in the form of physical items such as documents, photographs, clothing or charts. when a lawyer is questioning a witness and in the question refers to a physical object for the first time, the object is normally marked with a number or a letter of the alphabet so that we can more easily identify the object and refer to it. That procedure is very helpful in keeping track of physical objects. Sometimes, depending on the type of physical object, it may be too difficult or inconvenient to mark the object and the object is deemed marked rather than actually marked. Normally, when the object is first referred to a lawyer will ask the Court to have the object marked for identification. If the People make the request and the Court grants the request, the object is indeed marked with a number. If the defendant makes a request and the Court grants the request, the object is deemed or marked with a letter of the alphabet. That just helps us to remember who introduced the Exhibit. Sometimes to save time during the trial we will have certain physical objects deemed or marked for identification before the trial begins and you will then hear the lawyer refer to the object by its number or letter."

        "text": "reasonable doubt is an honest doubt of the defendant's guilt for which a reason exists based upon the nature and the quality of the evidence. It is an actual doubt, not an imaginary doubt. It is a doubt that a reasonable person acting in a matter of this importance would be likely to entertain because of the evidence that was presented or because of the lack of convincing evidence. The proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you so firmly convinced of a defendant's guilt that you have no reasonable doubt of the existence of any element of the crime or of the defendant's identity as the person who committed that crime. In determining whether the People have proven the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you should be guided solely by a full and fair evaluation of the evidence. After carefully evaluating the evidence, each of you must decide whether that evidence convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt. Whatever your verdict may be, it must not rest on baseless speculation nor may it by influenced in any way by bias, prejudice, sympathy or by a desire to bring an end to your deliberations or to avoid an unpleasant duty. Again, if you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the charged crime, you must find the defendant not guilty of the crime. And if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a charged crime, you must find the defendant guilty of that crime. Now, when each witness, by whomever called, is first examined, that is they are asked questions by the lawyer who calls the witness to testify, that is called direct examination. when the direct examination is completed, the other lawyer is permitted to ask questions of the witness and that is called cross—examination. The lawyers are responsible for questioning the witnesses. The Court may at times ask a witness a question. The jurors may not ask questions of the witnesses. You may, but are not required, to take notes. If you wish to take notes we will provide materials to you for that purpose. If you decide to take notes, you must follow these rules. Remember, every word of each witness is recorded by the court reporter and during deliberations upon your request the testimony will be read back to you in whole or in part. So there is no need to take verbatim notes of a witness' testimony. Notes by definition are a brief written record of something to assist your memory. A note should not take precedence over your own independent recollection. Remember, also, you are the finders of fact who are responsible to evaluate the believability and accuracy of a witness' testimony. It is, thus, important that you be able to both fully comprehend what a witness is saying and how a witness is saying it. Accordingly, you must not permit note taking to distract you from the proceedings. If you make a note, it should be brief and not distract you from what the next question and answer are. Any notes a juror takes are only for that juror's own personal use in refreshing his or her recollection. Thus, jurors who chose not to take notes must rely on their own independent recollection and must not be influenced by any notes another juror may have taken. Also, a juror's notes are not a substitute for the recorded transcript of the testimony or for any exhibit received into evidence. If during your deliberations there is a discrepancy between a juror's recollection and his or her notes regarding the evidence, you should ask to have the relevant testimony read back or the exhibit produced for your inspection."

        "text": "With some exceptions, what a witness may have been thinking when something has taken place is not relevant evidence. Finally, a witness is often not permitted to testify to hearsay, meaning generally that a witness cannot testify to what the witness may have said before the trial, or what another person may have said to that witness before the trial. But there are many exceptions to the hearsay rule for a variety of sound reasons, too numerous to go into at this time. I will, however, explain a couple of exceptions that frequently arise during a trial. Sometimes, a witness will be permitted to testify that the witness did something because of what someone said in that circumstance. It does not matter who uttered the statement or how the speaker gathered the information for the statement, or even whether the statement is truthful and accurate. It matters only that someone uttered the words and the witness did something upon hearing those words. So in that instance you may not consider what the witness was told for the truth of the words said to the witness. You may consider the words only for the reason they are offered, that is, to explain what the witness did after hearing the statement. During the presentation of evidence, the lawyers for the parties will in turn ask questions of the witnesses, and during that questioning a lawyer is not permitted to make comments on the witness's answers or on the case. That is not allowed. That happens on TV and in the movies, but it doesn't happen in real trials. In a real trial, it is at the end of the case that the lawyers are permitted to address the jurors in what are called a summation. And it is then that the lawyers may comment on the witnesses, the testimony, and any other evidence. During the questioning of a witness, the lawyer may use a question or some other presentation of evidence. If not in accord with a rule of law, that lawyer will object. When an objection is made, I will decide whether the rules permit the question to be asked or the evidence to be introduced. The objection will be one word: Objection. Anything more than that, then a party might gain an unfair edge. Making objections is part of the lawyer's job. You are not to draw any unfavorable inference because objections are made; they take place at every trial."

When an objection is made to a question before the witness answers, if I overrule the objection, the witness will be permitted to answer. If I sustain the objection, there is no answer and, therefore, no evidence. Remember, a question alone is not evidence. If a lawyer objects after the witness has answered the question and I overrule the objection, the answer stands as evidence. If I explain the objection, the answer is not evidence. The question and answer is stricken from the record, and you are to completely disregard that answer as though it were never said. Also, the Court has an obligation under the laws of New York to make sure that fundamental rules are followed, even if one of the lawyers does not actually voice an objection. So, on occasion, you may hear me say sustained or words to that effect, even though no one has actually objected. Any ruling by the Court on an objection of counsel or otherwise is based on our law and expresses no opinion about the facts of the case or whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. Remember, you are responsible for making that decision. Now, from time to time during the course of the trial, there will be conferences at the bench with counsel and if they become prolonged it may be necessary for the Court to ask the jury to return to the jury room. These conferences that deal with questions and matters of law and scheduling of the trial are my responsibility, so when the occasion arises when there are conferences at the bench or outside of your presence, I ask for your understanding. Upon completion of the presentation of evidence, the lawyers will address you in a closing statement, or what the law calls a summation. What a lawyer says in a summation is not evidence. The summations, however, provide each lawyer an opportunity to review the evidence presented and submit for your consideration the facts, inferences and conclusions which they contend may be properly drawn from the evidence. After summations are concluded, I will instruct you on the rules of law applicable to the case. You must accept and follow those rules. You will then begin your deliberations. During your deliberations, your function as jurors will be to decide what the facts are and to apply the rules of law that I set out. You will determine what the facts are from all of the testimony that you hear, the exhibits that are submitted and any stipulations the parties have agreed to. In other words, you will decide the case on the evidence. The conclusion you reach from determining the facts and applying the law will be your verdict, guilty or not guilty. Remember, you have promised to be a fair juror."

You can do this by asking yourself during your deliberations whether your views and conclusions would be different if the defendant, witnesses or others that you have heard about or seen in court were of a different race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or expression, religious practice, age, political affiliation or sexual orientation or if they did not have a disability. If the answer is yes, then in keeping with your promise to be fair, reconsider your views and conclusions along with the other jurors, and make sure your decision is based on the evidence and not on stereotypes or attitudes. Justice requires no less. Under our law, Juror Number 1 will serve as the jury's foreperson. During the trial, the foreperson has the same responsibilities as any other juror. During deliberations, the foreperson will sign any note that the jury sends to me, including that the jury has reached a verdict. The foreperson will announce the jury's verdict. Thus, in sum, the stages of the criminal trial are the opening statements, the presentation of evidence, summations, the final instructions of the Court to the jury on the law, and the deliberation of the jury and the verdict. During the trial, if you need to speak with me about something relating to your jury service or the trial, please tell a court officer that you need to speak to me. I will then arrange a meeting with the parties, in the courtroom or in my robing room. Do not discuss with your fellow jurors whatever you feel necessary to bring to my attention. And after we have had our conversation, do not discuss with your fellow jurors whatever it is that we discussed. During the trial we do our best to avoid delay, but from experience I know delays are inevitable for a multitude of reasons, through no one's deliberate fault. When those delays occur, I ask for your understanding and your patience. I assure you your time is important to me. I never take it for granted, and I never want to waste it. I request that you please be here at the times I set so that the absence or lateness of a juror is not the occasion for delay. If an emergency arises that may make you late or prevent you from attending, please call the Court, leave a number where you can be reached and explain the problem so we can minimize everyone's inconvenience. In this case, we have six alternate jurors."

The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election; then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again. In June of 2015, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president in the 2016 election; a few months later this conspiracy began. He invited his friend, David Pecker, to a meeting at Trump Tower here in Manhattan. Mr. Pecker was the CEO of a media company that, among other things, owned and published the National Enquirer tabloid. Michael Cohen was also at that meeting. He worked for the defendant as the defendant's special counsel at his company, the Trump Organization. And those three men formed a conspiracy at that meeting to influence the presidential election by concealing negative information about Mr. Trump in order to help him get elected."

You've heard this a few times already this morning, and you’re going to hear it a lot more during this trial. The People, the Government, they have the burden of proof to prove President Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. What that means, as Judge Merchan said a few minutes ago, is that President Trump is presumed innocent. He’s cloaked in innocence. And that cloak of innocence does not leave President Trump today. It doesn’t leave him at any day during this trial. And it won't leave him when you all deliberate. You will find that he is not guilty. Now, President Trump, you’ve seen him, of course, for years and years and years. You've seen him on television. You’ve seen photos of him. You've seen articles written about him. He’s in some ways larger than life. But, he’s also here in this courtroom doing what any of us would do: defending himself. You’re going to hear me, as I've done already today, and others, even witnesses, refer to him as \"President Trump\". This is a title that he has earned because he was our 45th President. We will call him \"President Trump\" out of respect for the office that he held from 2017 to 2021. And as everybody knows, it’s the office he’s running for right now. He’s the Republican nominee. But —— and this is important —— he’s not just our former President. He’s not just Donald Trump that you’ve seen on TV and read about and seen photos of. He’s also a man. He’s a husband. He’s a father. And he’s a person, just like you and just like me. What the People just did for about 45 minutes is present to you what appeared to be a very clean, nice story. It is not. It is not \"simple\", as the People just described. For one, and you heard the People admit this, most of what you are going to hear about in this trial, most of the conversations, most of the documents are from 2015, 2016, 2017, years and years ago, pre—COVID. And you’re going to hear witnesses talk about conversations, meetings, people they met with from 2015. The story that you just heard, you will learn, is not true. And at the end of this trial, there will be plenty of reasonable doubt. Here is what I expect that you will learn happened: President Trump, for years, built a very large, successful company. He employs thousands of people. It’s a purely private company. Not like AT&T or FedEx, publicly traded. And when he became President in 2017, he put up a wall between himself and his company, as the People just alluded to. He put his entire company in a Trust. He did this so that he could run the country, and he wouldn’t have anything to do with his company while he was President. But, some of his employees, you’ll learn, continued to help record personal expenses that President Trump incurred while he was President. Not surprising. They had been doing that for many years. You’ll hear they’re still doing that today. So, when —— when President Trump became President, when he took the Office of the Presidency in 2017, in January, Michael Cohen, who you heard the People allude to, assumed the role of President Trump’s personal attorney. And you will learn that each month in 2017, Michael Cohen sent an invoice to some of the employees at the Trump —— at the Trump Tower, right here in Midtown, for $35,000. And on this invoice, Michael Cohen described his work as \"payment to the retainer agreement for legal services rendered\". The invoice was processed. Somebody at Trump Tower generated a check. The check was ultimately signed, and there was a record in a ledger on President Trump's personal records that reflected the invoice. For nine of the checks, the check made its way down to the White House, and President Trump signed it. You’ll hear that he’s the only signatory on his personal checking account, which is why he signed the check. So, what on Earth is a crime? What is a crime about what I just described? This business records violation that the People have brought against President Trump, the 34 counts, ladies and gentlemen, are really just 34 pieces of paper, the 34 counts of the invoices that Mr. Cohen sent to the folks at Trump Tower, the checks that were generated because of that invoice, and then the ledger notation from the invoice that said \"for retainer agreement and legal services\". None of this was a crime. Now, you just heard the People’s theory about that $35,000, that it really wasn't a monthly retainer, that Michael Cohen was actually trying to cover up with President Trump the payback of this $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, who also goes by Ms. Clifford, Stephanie Clifford. You’ll hear that Ms. Clifford/Ms. Daniels, did, in fact, sign an NDA in October of 2016 in exchange for $130,000. But, think for a moment of what the People just told you. President Trump did not pay Mr. Cohen back $130,000. President Trump paid Michael Cohen $420,000. And in the same breath, the People told you that President Trump is known as a frugal businessman, that he pinches pennies. Ask yourself: Would a frugal businessman, would a man who pinches pennies repay $130,000 debt to the tune of $420,000? More significantly than that, ladies and gentlemen, you’re going to learn that this was not a payback. The $35,000 a month was not a payback to Mr. Cohen for the money that he gave to Ms. Daniels. He was President Trump’s personal attorney. You will see documents, you will see emails. His signature block, Michael Cohen's signature block in 2017 said \"Michael Cohen, Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump\". You will hear that he told people that he served as President Trump’s personal attorney. You will hear that he did legal work for President Trump and the First Lady as his personal attorney. Now, the People talk about the ledger. I mentioned the ledger a few times. Listen, the ledger is just a fancy way of describing how folks at Trump Tower, employees that work for President Trump kept track of the money that came in and the money that went out. There’s nothing fancy about a ledger. It's something, I suppose, like a checkbook, where you keep track of what you're spending money on. And I expect that you will learn that the record, the ledger that was used in this case that President Trump is charged in part with, that the information that was placed in that ledger was done by someone named Deb Tarasoff. I expect she will testify. You will hear that she’s a woman who has worked for President Trump for decades. Nobody is going to say she did anything wrong. I don’t expect the People will say she is part of this scheme. What she will tell you is she had a conversation with another boss, someone who she worked for, another accountant, someone who has nothing to do with this; and she was told when she got the invoice from Mr. Cohen to call it \"legal expense\", which is exactly what the invoice said. And that’s exactly what she did. And then, after recording it, she generated a check, which was her job. And then, again, for nine of the eleven checks, the checks made their way from Trump Tower, here in Midtown, to 230 miles down south to the White House, where they were signed. But —— and you heard this again from the People. I am not saying anything controversial. President Trump had nothing to do, had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger. Ms. Tarasoff isn’t going to say she had any conversations with President Trump: Hey, how should I book this? How should I book this to keep it secret and keep it quiet? The invoice says it’s for services rendered. And it's Michael Cohen. He’s a lawyer. He worked for The Trump Organization, you'll learn, for many years. You won’t hear any of that. Her boss, the person who told her how to book it, he's not gonna say he talked to President Trump about it. He's not going to say that he called the White House and interrupted a meeting as President Trump was running the country and said: Hey, we got this invoice, I know we’re trying to cover it up here. Absolutely not. You’ll learn President Trump had nothing to do with any of the 34 pieces of paper, the 34 counts, except he signed on to the checks, in the White House while he was running the country. That's not a crime. So —— and some of you heard this last week during jury selection. What are the People going to do? I don’t expect they’re going to dispute what I just said. I don’t expect they’re going to call a witness that says that President Trump had anything to do with what was written on the ledger, with generating the check, with the invoice coming in. So, you heard last week, and I expect you'll hear it during this trial, this idea of \"accomplice liability\"; the idea that the People can get around the complete lack of knowledge or intent by President Trump. And, look, the reality is, President Trump is not on the hook, is not criminally responsible for something that Mr. Cohen may have done years after the fact. The evidence will prove otherwise. You also heard a lot of —— a lot of communication about the 2016 election. The People just told you that the reason why these invoices were recorded the way they were recorded way after the election —— President Trump was already in office —— was to cover up for Mr. Cohen, suggesting that Mr. Cohen was somehow trying to influence —— \"influence\" is the word they used —— the 2016 election. I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It’s called democracy. They put something sinister on this idea, as if it was a crime. You’ll learn it’s not. Michael Cohen paying Stormy Daniels or Stephanie Clifford $130,000 in exchange for her agreeing to not publicly spread false —— false claims about President Trump is not illegal. I’m going to say that again. Entering into a non—disclosure agreement ——"

And there are going to be a lot of witnesses in addition to Mr. Cohen. You’re going to hear myself, the other folks that are working with President Trump cross—examine, as the judge talked about, these witnesses. Some we’ll cross—examine a lot. Some very little, if at all. But, one witness who you will hear a lot about is Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen served as President Trump’s attorney for many years, long before President Trump became President. He served as his personal attorney, working at Trump Tower, being paid for by the Trump companies. And then, as I mentioned, in 2017, he served as his —— as the personal attorney to President Trump in 2017, after President Trump took office. You will learn that shortly after the election in 2016, Michael Cohen wanted a job in the administration. He didn’t get one. You’ll hear that he was loyal. He was very loyal to President Trump and the companies for years. He defended President Trump on television, in printed media, publicly, privately. But, unbeknownst to President Trump, in all the years that Mr. Cohen worked for him, Mr. Cohen was also a criminal. Apart from his work for President Trump and the Trump companies, he cheated on his taxes, he lied to banks, he lied about side businesses he had with taxi medallions, among other things. And as the People alluded to, in 2018, he got caught. Now, shortly after getting caught in 2018, you will learn that he made a decision. The decision that he made was to blame President Trump for virtually all of his problems. He had been eventually disbarred as an attorney. He’s a convicted felon. And he also is a convicted perjurer. He is an admitted liar. For many, many years, going back before President Trump became President, even before Michael Cohen started working for The Trump Organization, you’ll learn that Michael Cohen was obsessed with President Trump. He is obsessed with President Trump even to this day. Today, Michael Cohen has podcasts, two of them. He goes on TV, X, TikTok, other social media platforms, and he rants and he raves about President Trump. He criticizes President Trump. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump go to prison. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump’s family go to prison. He has talked extensively about President Trump getting convicted in this case."

That means, to be clear, that just like I expect witnesses will come in here and raise their right hand and swear to tell the truth and then testify, that means that Mr. Cohen did that, raised his right hand, swore to tell the truth, and then lied. And admitted that. Pled guilty to lying. Under oath. So, you have two meaningful and significant issues with Mr. Cohen: His obsession with President Trump, and his desire to see President Trump go to jail in this case. His entire financial livelihood with podcasts. He's written several books. He’s frequently on the media. His entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump’s destruction. And, second, the fact —— admitted fact that he has lied under oath. I submit to you —— and I will talk to you again, as Judge Merchan said, at the end of the case —— that given this, you cannot make a serious decision about President Trump relying on the words of Michael Cohen. There will be other witnesses. I expect Ms. Clifford/Stormy Daniels will testify. She is, similarly, extremely biased against President Trump. You will hear that he met her several years ago, in 2006. I may have said 2008 earlier. In 2006, some 18 years ago. Then, at the time, as some of you may remember, President Trump was running a very popular TV show called The Apprentice, which was looking —— always looking for new opportunities and had a series of communications with Ms. Daniels. But, ultimately, it did not work out. Since then, Ms. Clifford has made a living off of these communications, even though she publicly denied any improper relationship in writing. You will hear that in the weeks and months leading up to the 2016 election, she saw her chance to make a lot of money, $130,000. And it worked. She got an NBA, and Michael Cohen paid her that money. He did that in exchange for her silence. Which, of course, didn’t work. And since this story came out in 2018, became public, she’s made hundreds of thousands of dollars because of it. She also wrote a book. She was paid for a documentary. And you'll also learn that courts have sided with President Trump in legal disputes between Ms. Daniels and President Trump and that she owes him somewhere around $600,000 as a result of those cases. But, I’m going to say something else about her testimony, and this is important. It doesn't matter. What I mean by that is, I expect you will learn that Ms. —— that Ms. Daniels doesn’t have any idea. She doesn't know anything about the charged 34 counts in this case. She has no idea what Michael Cohen wrote on the invoice. She has no idea how it was booked at Trump Tower. And she has no idea about the checks that are also charged in this indictment. So, her testimony, while salacious, does not matter. Now, I want to talk to you for just a few minutes about what the People spent a long time talking about, which is this catch and kill scheme between Mr. Pecker at AMI and President Trump and Michael Cohen as the part of his lawyer. The People used the word \"conspiracy\". You will hear and see that there are 34 counts in this indictment. \"Conspiracy\" is not one of them. President Trump is not charged with any \"conspiracy\". That’s a word the People have chosen to use. The reality is, there’s nothing illegal about a scheme. There's nothing illegal about what you will hear happened among AMI and National Enquirer and Mr. Pecker and President Trump. It happens —— I expect you will hear shortly, this sort of thing happens regularly, that newspapers make decisions about what to publish, when to publish, and how to publish. It happens with politicians, with wealthy people, with famous people. It’s not a scheme. Unless a scheme means something that doesn’t matter, that’s not illegal, that’s not against the law."

So I decided that to see if I could hire Bonnie Fuller. And I approached her, and I was able to bring her over from Wenner Media to become the Chief Editor of the Star."

Without prejudging the testimony, I would not be shocked if Mr. Pecker can lay a business records foundation for some or all of those materials. Certainly if he can't, I would be shocked if the custodian couldn't achieve that. Especially in light of Mr. Howard's absence at this trial, there are some complicated and embedded hearsay issues in the documents. Mr. Pecker is participating in some of the text message exchanges. He is also participating in some of the emails. Those are not complicated. The ones where he is not a participant, there is embedded hearsay issues that will need to be addressed. We don't want to necessarily slow down the witness's testimony when those come in as business records in front of the jury, but at some point, particularly with respect to communications that Mr. Pecker is not a party to, we would like to be heard on the other hearsay issues they raise."

That text message communication is a business record. There's still an embedded hearsay issue with respect to the factual assertions in the text messages coming in for the truth or not. That is the issue that is more tricky and requires more analysis. The business record foundation doesn't alleviate that issue. My point is, when Mr. Pecker is on the stand, if all that is going to be happening, communications are going to be coming into evidence based on the business records foundation, and some would be displayed to the jury when Mr. Pecker is a party, I don't think that is complicated. On the other hand, if the government contemplates putting in text messages from Mr. Howard to third parties who have not testified yet and may not testify, and to display them to illustrate a narrative during the testimony of Mr. Pecker, that would be much more complicated, and we would ask to be heard at that time or whatever time the Court thinks is appropriate."

So, as I said, I expect one way or the other the government to lay a business records foundation that that email thread can come in, not for the content of the statements but for the fact that AMI maintained an email system that allows those to come in. There are factual assertions in that email that are made by hearsay declarants, none of whom are going to testify at the trial, so those factual assertions in the email cannot come in for the truth. When I say it is a little bit tedious, but there are several emails like this, and many, many sets of text messages like this. I am not suggesting the government is doing anything wrong here, but we would like to flag it because it does raise some complex issues that are going to need to be addressed."

That being said —— in order to get an advanced ruling. That being said, I understand what Mr. Bove is saying, and I think there are certain portions of some of the emails or texts that would come in but not for the truth. I do think that is kind of a case—by—case analysis. My suggestion is that Mr. Bove give us the proposed portions of these emails and texts that he believes should not be coming in for the truth. We can see if we agree about some of them. For example, the one that Mr. Bove just mentioned, which would be People's Exhibit 163, there is a portion of that email chain in which there is a detailed recitation of the Dino Sajudin story. Although that should come in because it informs what happened afterwards, we're not intending to argue that that is coming in for the truth of the matter asserted. So that is an example where I think we could agree, and there are probably many others."

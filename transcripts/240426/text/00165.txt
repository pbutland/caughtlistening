1 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
2 THE COURT: Please approach.
3 (whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
4 MR. STEINGLASS: First of all, if he is putting in
5 this as a prior inconsistent statement, the witness has
6 already acknowledged the inconsistency.
7 You don't get to prove up a prior inconsistent
8 statement with extrinsic evidence once the witness has
9 acknowledged the inconsistency.
10 Also, we haven't gotten notice of this exhibit.
11 MR. BOVE: This is being offered in response to
12 the redirect.
13 THE COURT: Assuming it's an inconsistency, if
14 it's conceded, that is the end of it. That is the end of
15 it.
16 (Whereupon, the following occurred in open court:)
17 THE COURT: Objection sustained.
18 CONTINUED RECROSS EXAMINATION

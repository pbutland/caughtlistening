12 Q That's different from an admission, right?
13 A Yes.
14 Q One of the other reasons that you were following this
15 FEC investigation was that you were actually a party at one
16 point, right?
17 A Yes.
18 Q And you and AMI had counsel, correct?
19 A Yes.
20 Q And the FEC was also accusing you of a campaign
21 finance violation, correct?
22 A Yes.
23 Q And you certainly did not admit to a campaign finance
24 violation in connection with anything that you described during

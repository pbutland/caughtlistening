R. Graff â€” Cross/Necheles
1 Q And he respected you; right?
2 MS. HOFFINGER: Objection.
3 A I'd like to think so.
4 THE COURT: Overruled.
5 Q Respected your intelligence?
6 A I don't think I would have been there 34 years if he
7 didn't.
8 Q What were your days like?
9 A Again, every single day was different. That was part
10 of why it was a very unusual place to be. There was no typical
11 day, but I usually get there early in the morning before he
12 came in. You know, kind of get his office ready for the day.
13 You know, look at the calendar, see what was happening that
14 day. You know, kind of anticipated what needed to be done.
15 Those kinds of things.
16 Q And he was working on a whole variety of things;
17 correct?
18 A Always.
19 Q He was in the real estate business; right?
20 A Right.
21 It evolved from when I started. It was primarily real
22 estate when I started, and through the years it evolved into
23 many businesses.
24 Q He wrote books?
25 A Right. Many books.

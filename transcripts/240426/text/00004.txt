1 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you.
2 One update on that.
3 After further discussions with the third party’s
4 counsel this morning, we think we no longer need the
5 Court’s intervention on that today.
6 We will bring it to your attention should it
7 become necessary.
8 THE COURT: Great.
9 We’ll go to one o’clock.
10 Is there anything else?
ll MR. STEINGLASS: There’s a few things.
12 First, is your Honor going to address the issue
13 with the jury that was raised at the end of the day about
14 the, what we consider to be, improper impeachment by
15 omission by Mr. Bove?
16 THE COURT: Would you like to be heard, Mr. Bove?
17 MR. BOVE: Yes, Judge.
18 Just to clarify, my intentions for this morning
19 on this issue are to begin by basically saying to
20 Mr. Pecker: I apologize for any confusion about that,
21 clarify a little bit about his relationship with
22 Ms. Hicks, and move on.
23 There’s grand jury testimony on this issue for
24 where a specific question was asked. I'll draw the
25 witness’ attention to that and go through it.

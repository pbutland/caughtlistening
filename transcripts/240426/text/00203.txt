1 information on that.
2 Q For people who may not be more familiar with the
3 alphabet soup of bank compliance, can you describe what BSA
4 means?
5 A Sure.
6 Bank Secrecy Act. It's the method of protecting the bank
7 and making sure we're not doing transactions or opening any
8 types of account that could present not only reputational risk
9 to the institution, but also be against the law.
10 Q So, it's a law that sets forth a number of
11 requirements that the bank has to follow?
12 A That's correct.
13 Q How about AML?
14 A AML is anti—money—laundering.
15 It's another form of oversight to ensure that clients
16 aren't using an account to filter money through.
17 Q I think you referenced something that you referred to
18 as "the back office".
19 What is the back office?
20 A So, a bank has three lines of defense.
21 The first would be your client—facing employees, which
22 would be, you know, people like myself, as well as individuals
23 who work in the offices on the ground level, where you would do
24 your typical transaction.
25 The next would be your BSA/AML Compliance Team.

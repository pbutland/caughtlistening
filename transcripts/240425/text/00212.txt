1 And so —— so, to help you remember things today that you
2 did not remember very well at the time ——
3 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
4 THE COURT: Overruled.
5 Q Let me start that over.
6 To help you remember things from your testimony today that
7 you didn't remember at the time of your preparation, you went
8 back and read things that you said in 2018 and 2019; correct?
9 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
10 THE COURT: Sustained as to form.
11 Please rephrase.
12 Q There are things that you did not remember very well
13 that you testified about today that you used other documents to
14 refresh yourself on; correct?
15 A Yes.
16 Q Things that you, independently, don't have a strong
17 recollection of, so you're going based on what you said
18 previously?
19 A (Pause). Um —— any documents that I reviewed, I was
20 consistent to what I said when I —— when I'm going back to the
21 original grand jury testimonies that I had.
22 Q And that was important, right, to be consistent with
23 what you had said previously?
24 A No.
25 Just refresh my memory.

5 within the company whereby, the payroll register for American
6 Media, the company based in Florida, was hidden upon each post,

8 right on the front page of the paper.
9 So, I had a number of incidents over the years.
10 So I asked Daniel, Daniel Rotstein, to handle this for
11 me.
12 So, I called him, and said, look, I don't want to have
13 a check from the Trump Organization going through American
14 Media. I don't know exactly how it's going to be reimbursed.
15 So, I would like for you to speak to Michael Cohen
16 directly and work out with him, whereby, you bill him the
17 invoice for $125,000 and reimburse American Media.
18 So, I called Michael Cohen to tell him about —— that
19 Daniel Rotstein would be handling this reimbursement.

21 directly. I made the introduction. Michael told me that he
22 created a company called, Resolution Consultants, that would ——
23 that we should bill and Daniel Rotstein prepared the agreement,
24 the assignment and the invoice.

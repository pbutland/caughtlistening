1 This is, in our view, a core business record,
2 insofar, as it is, essentially, the general counsel of AMI
3 releasing a source from an NDA.
4 Acquiring sources, signing NDAs, releasing
5 sources from NDAs, these are core business practices of
6 AMI. And so, we don't think that this is embedded in
7 hearsay.
8 We think that this is a business record in its
9 own right much like the Court said yesterday with Exhibit
10 164 which Your Honor described as, this is exactly what a
11 business record is.
12 So that's our View as to this.
13 THE COURT: Can you establish that this was not a
14 one up?
15 This was a regular practice that these types of
16 documents memorializing this type of transactions were
17 routinely generated?
18 MR. STEINGLASS: I can ask him that.
19 THE COURT: If you can ask him that, then I will
20 be satisfied that it is a business record and it will come
21 in as a business record.
22 MR. STEINGLASS: I understand that.
23 And can I give you an alternate argument so we
24 don't have to do it again if he doesn't say that, which is
25 that this is not really being offered for its truth in any

5 Q And I should just clarify.
6 Are portions of phone numbers and email addresses redacted
7 in this exhibit to protect personal information of the parties
8 to this text chain?
9 A (No response.)
10 Q Did you understand my question?
11 A Can you repeat it? I'm sorry.
12 Q Yeah, of course.
13 My question was: Are portions of the phone numbers and
14 email addresses redacted on this exhibit to protect personal
15 information of the parties to this text chain?
16 A Yes, that's correct.
17 Q Okay. So I want to zoom in on the last column of the
18 lines marked DOC 47—240 to 241.
19 Let me first ask you, is this last column basically a
20 summary of the date, the time of the text, who it's from, who
21 it's to, as well as the body of the text itself?
22 A Yes, it is.
23 Q If you look at the —— what does the date and time
24 marked say on this top text?
25 A 2016/07/23, 19:21:45 UTC.

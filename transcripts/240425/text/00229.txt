1 I don't see any.
2 Perhaps Counsel sees one.
3 But, I think that was a totally improper line of
4 questioning. I think it left the jury with the
5 misimpression that the witness was asked about it and
6 omitted it. That's a prior inconsistent statement; and I
7 think it's a prior omission by Bornholdt.
8 THE COURT: Is there anything in that that says
9 he was asked if Hope Hicks was there and his response to
10 that?
11 MR. BOVE: I don't have a specific response to
12 that.
13 The question to the witness was, does he recall
14 discussing that.
15 This document was marked Defense A102.
16 It contains a substantial set of redactions, so I
17 don't know what's underneath those, and I don't know what
18 came up.
19 It's appropriate for me to ask if he remembers.
20 He then asked me to show a document.
21 THE COURT: He didn't ask for A102.
22 MR. BOVE: He understood. He asked for a
23 document to refresh his recollection about the meeting he
24 was talking about.
25 So I gave it to him.

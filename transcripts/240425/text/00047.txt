2 So I think these questions, if they are
3 permitted, are opening the door to a lot more explanation.

7 I don't think that we are opening the door to any
8 kind of expert testimony on the law. But, anyway, the more
9 important thing here is that this witness' understanding of
10 whether his own conduct violated the law is highly
11 relevant.
12 I don't think it opens the door.
13 THE COURT: I agree. He's not asked to provide
14 the law. He is asked if he has awareness of the law.
15 MS. NECHELES: I think he was asked, were you
16 aware that there was a law that did the following, and we
17 disagree that the law did the following.
18 Did you think what you were doing was illegal?
19 THE COURT: I am going to allow it.
20 MS. HOFFINGER: We dispute that that's the law,
21 your Honor.
22 (Discussion at side—bar concluded, and the
23 following occurred in open court.)
24 THE COURT: Objection is overruled.
25 Q Do you remember the question?

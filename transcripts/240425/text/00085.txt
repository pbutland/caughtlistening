10 A. It says: "The only story that was posted in October
11 of 2008, before AIM owned it, the old Radar magazine. The tape
12 was not part of the story that existed online. I suggested it
13 was lost during many of the site changes during the years.
14 Nevertheless, I've deleted the story completely. It no longer
15 exists."

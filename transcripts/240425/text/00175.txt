11 A That's correct.
12 Q And there were also instances where AMI purchased a
13 story in order to use it as leverage against a celebrity;
14 correct?
15 A Yes.
16 Q To use it as leverage, to use something like to get the
17 celebrity to participate in an interview?
18 A That's correct.
19 Q Or sometimes to get the celebrity to allow AMI to use
20 the celebrity's likeness?
21 A Yes.

24 itself, right, that wasn't the point?
25 A That's correct.

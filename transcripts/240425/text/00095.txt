1 with Dylan Howard around this time?
2 A. I found out after that he was speaking to Dylan Howard,
3 which I was not pleased about.
4 Q. Why?
5 A. Because it was my understanding, what I instructed
6 Dylan Howard to do, is to stay out of it, out of the story, out
7 of the selling process.
8 Q. How did you come to learn that Dylan Howard did not, in
9 fact, follow those orders?
10 A. Dylan came to my office towards the end of October and
11 said that there was an agreement between Keith Davidson and
12 Michael Cohen. It was for $120,000.
13 And Michael Cohen was supposed to wire the funds to
14 Keith Davidson twice and he never did.
15 Dylan was upset. He was very agitated and said that
16 Michael Cohen is going to make him look very bad with his two
17 top sources. And he said, you understand, when you renege with
18 a source, what the impact would be.
19 So he asked me if I would get Michael Cohen on the
20 phone.
21 I set up a Signal call to Michael Cohen. So it was
22 Michael Cohen, myself and Dylan Howard.
23 Dylan Howard was very aggressive with Michael Cohen on
24 the phone for not paying. Michael Cohen said that I should
25 pay. He said, "David, you should pay."

1 I don't care if it is publicly filed or not.
2 THE COURT: You can hand it up.
3 MR. STEINGLASS: While I am doing that, I will
4 hand you a copy of the law cited therein that I am going to
5 refer to during this argument.
6 THE COURT: Thank you.
7 MR. BOVE: Thank you, Judge.
8 The first disputed exhibit is the second one
9 referenced in your email from yesterday, and you also
10 referenced this morning, People's 169.
11 And this is a December 9, 2016, email from
12 Cameron Stracher, the General Counsel of AMI, purportedly
13 to Mr. Sajudin.
14 And the defense's position on this one is that
15 while there is a business records foundation for the
16 header, these are factual assertions in the body of the
17 email where —— I don't think —— there is no foundation for
18 an argument that the general counsel of AMI is a
19 co—conspirator, and it can't come in on that basis, and it
20 should be excluded.
21 MR. STEINGLASS: First of all, I agree with the
22 last point. I am not seeking to admit this as a
23 co—conspirator's statement. We don't think that Mr.
24 Stracher is a co—conspirator.
25 Just give me one second, please.

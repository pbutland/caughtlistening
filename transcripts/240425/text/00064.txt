1 THE COURT: So, there are a couple of things we
2 would like to go over. Let's just take a short break.
3 Let's come back in five or ten minutes, and then we can get
4 started.
5 MR. STEINGLASS: Okay, thank you.
6 (Short recess is taken.)
7 THE CLERK: Continuing case on trial, People
8 versus Donald J. Trump. All parties are present.
9 THE COURT: All right, counsel. Let's go over
10 what the disputed issues are.
11 MR. STEINGLASS: Judge, would it be convenient
12 for you if I handed you a binder that has all the exhibits?
13 THE COURT: Yes.
14 MR. STEINGLASS: Mr. Bove, you are good? You
15 have one?
16 MR. BOVE: Yes, I have one.
17 THE COURT: Thank you.
18 MR. STEINGLASS: Also, Judge, before we get
19 started, I know you suggested in an email that no further
20 letters were necessary. We were about to hit send on our
21 response letter to counsel's letter.
22 I don't want the state of the record being that
23 there is a written submission from the defense and not from
24 us.
25 I wonder if you would let me pass this up?

1 Q. What did understand that text to mean in general?
2 A. That American Media should buy the story for $120,000.
3 Q. Who did you understand the woman to be referring to?
4 A. Based on the conversation I had over the phone with
5 Dylan Howard, I knew it was Stormy Daniels.
6 Q. And how did you respond to him in the next text?
7 A. I guess I should clarify, I said —— I said, we can't
8 pay $120,000.
9 Q. Is that second entry a response from you to Dylan
10 Howard? I should have clarified that first.
11 A. Yes, when I spoke to him over the phone —— I would like
12 to add more to this.
13 Q. Please.
14 A. When he called me, he mentioned about the story other
15 than not paying $120,000. I said, I don't want the National
16 Enquirer to be associated with a porn star. I said that our
17 largest distributor, our largest retailer, Walmart, this would
18 be very bad for the magazine, very damaging for American Media.
19 I don't want any affiliation with it at all. To call Michael
20 Cohen.
21 Q. Well —— withdrawn.
22 So you told Dylan Howard that we can't pay $120,000; is
23 that right?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. Why did you say that?

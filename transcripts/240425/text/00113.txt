1 Q What happened then?
2 A When I go back to Mr. Trump's office, I said to him
3 that: "Michael Cohen is very concerned about his bonus for this
4 year. And I want you to know that he's very loyal. I want you
5 to know he's been working very hard, from my perspective, and I
6 believe he would throw himself under a bus for you. And he's
7 saying that his bonus is really very important to him on the
8 monies that he's going to receive.”
9 So, Mr. Trump told me that —— one, he says, "I don't know
10 what you're talking about." He said, "Michael Cohen has
11 multiple apartments in my buildings. I think he's got about 12
12 apartments in my buildings. He owns 50 taxi medallions, which
13 are worth a million—dollars apiece." He said, "Don't worry
14 about it. I'll take care of it."
15 Q Mr. Trump said, Don't worry about it. I'll take care
16 of it"?
17 A Yes. That's correct.
18 Q So, directing your attention to January 6th of 2017,
19 did you attend another meeting that day at Trump Tower?
20 A Yes, I did.
21 Q How did you come to be there?
22 A I received a call from Rhona Graff, saying to me that,
23 "The President—Elect would like to see you for a meeting" ——
24 Q And what did you say?
25 A —— "at Trump Tower."

1 you for regarding the Karen McDougal story and the doorman
2 story?
3 A I felt that he was thanking me for buying them and for
4 not publishing any of the stories and helping the way I did.
5 Q And did he say why he was so appreciative?
6 A He said that the stories could be very embarrassing.
7 Q What do you understand that to mean?
8 A I felt that it was going to be very embarrassing to
9 him, his family, and the campaign.
10 Q Now, did he ever say anything to you that made you
11 think that his concern about these stories getting out was for
12 his family, rather than for his campaign?
13 A I thought it was for the campaign.
14 Q What makes you say that?
15 A Every time we —— the conversations that I had with
16 Michael Cohen with respect to both of these stories, the family
17 was —— his family was never mentioned; and the conversations
18 that I had directly with Mr. Trump, his family wasn't
19 mentioned.
20 So, I made the assumption it was the —— the concern was the
21 campaign.
22 Q And was —— withdrawn.
23 Did there come a time when you perceived that Donald
24 Trump's concern shifted in some way?
25 A (No response).

8 Unfortunately, they didn't laugh.

10 A And then, they left before him. They left.
11 And Mr. Trump asked me to sit down to chat.
12 Q And can you tell us about that chat, please?
13 A Yes.
14 He asked me how I was doing.
15 I said, "I'm doing okay."
16 He asked me how Karen was doing.
17 And I told —— he asked, "How's Karen doing —— How's our

19 I said, "She's —— she's writing her articles. She's quiet,
20 easy. Things are going fine."
21 So, he said, "I want to thank you for handling the McDougal
22 situation."
23 And then he said, "I want to" —— he also said, "I want to
24 thank you for the doorman story, the doorman situation."
25 Q And what did you understand Mr. Trump to be thanking

10 THE COURT: All right. So I think I kept the jury
11 waiting long enough for now. I will rule on this at
12 another time.
13 MR. STEINGLASS: I will cite the law. I only read
14 the texts, not the law.
15 Also, the James case, which I handed up, and the
16 Settles case.
17 Another case is People versus Settles, which is a
18 seminal case.
19 We believe the later statements are declarations
20 against penal interest. For that proposition, we cite
21 James, and Settles is a Court of Appeals case. The site is
22 46 NY 2d 154, at 167.
23 THE COURT: So during the lunch recess, I will go
24 back and read those decisions and see if it changes my
25 mind.

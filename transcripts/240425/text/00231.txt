6 The point of my question was, she was not in
7 there.
8 THE COURT: Mr. Bove, are you missing my point?
9 I don't think you're responding to what I'm
10 saying.
11 I'm saying you asked him the question. You gave
12 him a document in response to that question, which gave
13 everybody the impression that what he was looking for was
14 contained in that document.
15 And that was not the case; right?
16 MR. BOVE: Yes.
17 THE COURT: So, please be careful.
18 Anything else?
19 MR. STEINGLASS: Yes, Judge.
20 Mr. Colangelo has an application.
21 MR. COLANGELO: Thank you, Your Honor.
22 If the Court permits the People to make an
23 application tomorrow to compel compliance with a
24 third party subpoena, this is a witness from The Trump
25 Organization for a custodial witness.

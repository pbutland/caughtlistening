I looked at the exhibits that were provided by both the People and the Defense. The People provided four exhibits, one for each one of those violations. The Defense provided a number of exhibits, I believe it was close to 500 pages in total, and also submitted a —— so, People, why don’t we begin with you going through each of the violations, and explain to me why you believe that it constitutes a violation."

        "text": "Okay. Judge, I just want to start by saying the Defendant’s complaining that this Order restricting his extrajudicial statements in this case, was not intended to allow everyone to attack him, but not to allow him to respond, and that's on page one of his memo. The Order was issued because of the Defendant’s persistent and escalating rhetoric aimed at participants in this proceeding. And the Order was intended to prevent the Defendant from attacking witnesses in this case and jurors in the case and others. He has already been found by the Court to have violated the Order nine times, and he has done it again here. With respect to the first violation, I am going to talk about, this is, actually, the second violation on the Order to Show Cause that we handed up. It’s Exhibit F in the April 25th Affirmation. And I will just start by reading it. The Defendant said the following: But this Judge said that I can't get away from the trial. You know, he is rushing the trial like crazy. Nobody has ever seen a thing like this. That jury was picked so fast, 95 percent Democrats. The area is mostly all Democrat. You think of it as a, just a purely Democrat area. It is a very unfair situation, that I can tell you. This was just hours before he had a hearing here related to his previous violations. He was on the media, and he used his platform there to criticize the seated jury in this case. There is no inference needed. It is not just any jurors, it is these jurors, in this case, sitting right in this room in a few minutes. His contrived justification in his papers is that, well, the media was saying some of what I am saying. That’s a little bit like his re—posting argument, except weaker. The Defendant saying anything amplifies it and creates an air of menace that is substantially different from a media report. By talking about the jury at all, he places this process and this proceeding here in jeopardy. That is what the Order forbids, and he did it anyway. I will move on to the second violation that we are alleging, and it is actually the fourth in the Order to Show Cause. It’s Exhibit H in the Affirmation that we filed on the 25th. That statement was made on the morning of the 25th. So, on his way down here for the hearing at some kind of a press event, I think at 49th and Fifth Avenues in Manhattan. And the Defendant was out, and there were reporters around who were asking him questions. I think that was all part of the plan. And one of the questions, and I will read now the question, and then the defendant’s statement. The question was, what have you thought of David Pecker’s testimony so far? When was the last time you spoke to him? The defendant’s answer was, he has been very nice. I mean, he has been —— David’s been very nice, a nice guy. This is a classic carrot stick. First of all, there is no question that there was a witness in the proceeding because the witness was going to be testifying a hour or two after the Defendant made that statement. As I said the other day, the Defendant knows what he is doing. He talks about the testifying witness, says nice things, does it in front of the cameras. To be clear, he was asked other questions about this case and ignored them. So this was not just the Defendant responding to everything the reporters were asking him. He selectively responded to this question and not others. The one he answered was about the witness who was testifying. It was deliberate, and it was calculating. Pecker, be nice. Everyone is hearing this. I have a platform, and I will talk about you, so be nice. What the defense counsel described as innocuous statements about Mr. Pecker on page five of their memo, is anything but. They are deliberate shots across the bow to everyone that may come to this courtroom to tell the truth about the Defendant and what he did. Moving on to the third statement that I will talk about, which this time it is also the third statement in the Order to Show Cause, and it’s Exhibit G in the Affirmation that I filed. This is from an interview that the Defendant gave to a Pennsylvania TV station on the morning of Tuesday, April 23rd. It didn’t actually air until that evening, and the statement is as follows: Well, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar, and he has got no credibility whatsoever. He was a lawyer and you rely on your lawyers. But Michael Cohen was a convicted lawyer. He was a lawyer for many people, not just me, and he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did for me. Largely, it was essentially all because of what he did in terms of the campaign. I don’t think there was anything wrong with that, with the charges that they made, but what he did is —— is he did some pretty bad things, I guess, with banking or whatever. If it was a personal thing to him. David Pecker, I don't know exactly what he’s going to be testifying against but —— or about. He will be testifying today. Again, no question this is related to this proceeding. The Defendant is talking about two witnesses, one of whom was on the stand at the time in the middle of testimony. It’s clearly willful, clearly knowing. The Defendant thinks the rules should be different for him. I talked a bit about the impact of comments about a testifying witness, perhaps not on that witness, but on other witnesses. It is an insidious thing. I will talk a little bit more about Michael Cohen in a moment. Moving to the —— and, again, in that statement he is talking both about Michael Cohen and his credibility, which is a theme here, and then about David Pecker, who is the witness on the stand. Finally, I will move on to the first statement in the Order to Show Cause, which is Exhibit E from the April 25th Affirmation. That was made also on April 22nd, earlier in the day than the statement I just talked about. And I know I said this the other day, that this statement was made right outside of these doors, the doors of this courtroom in the little pen that’s set up where he speaks to the gathered media everyday. He stood there for almost nine minutes and he talked about a prospective witness that was going to be in this courtroom at some date in the future, Michael Cohen. What he said was, and it's two different excerpts: But, they called the payment to a lawyer a legal expense in the books. They didn’t call it construction. They didn't say you are building a building. They called it a payment to a lawyer because, as you know, Cohen is a lawyer, represented a lot of people over the years. I am not the only one and wasn’t very good in a lot of ways in terms of his representation, but he represented a lot of people. But, he puts in an invoice, or whatever, a bill, and they pay, and they call it a legal expense. I got indicted for that. Later the Defendant went on, quote, and when are they going to look at all the lines that Cohen did in the last trial? He got caught lying in the last trial. He got caught lying, pure lying. And when are they going to look at that? This and all of these are clearly related to this proceeding. They are clearly willful. The Defendant is talking about witnesses and the jury in this case, one right here outside the door, all during the trial. This is the most critical time, the time the proceeding needs to be protected, where —— particularly where Defendant has demonstrated over time, and recently, his willingness to say and do anything he can to try to infect and disrupt this process. That’s what the Defendant has tried to do and continues to try to do. We understand the Court's concern about Michael Cohen, but in the statements at issue here, the Defendant wasn’t responding to anything in particular. He talks about things Michael Cohen has said in the weeks and months before defendant’s statements at issue here. There is mention of TikToks more recently, and now, I will talk about the exhibits, the 50—plus exhibits, 500 pages of documents that were filed with Defense papers. But, there is nothing to indicate that the Defendant saw those statements when they were made. This Order has only been in effect for four to five weeks, not months. Michael Cohen is not a political opponent. Defendant's comments about Michael Cohen relate to issues at the heart of this proceeding and Michael Cohen's participation in the proceeding. They don’t relate to political policies or goals of the Defendant. The Defendant is doing everything he can to make this case and the proceeding about his politics. It’s not. It’s about his criminal conduct. His statements are corrosive to this proceeding and to the fair administration of justice. As your Honor knows, we just did this the other day. What we have to prove here is the existence of a lawful Order expressing an ongoing mandate, which I submit is very clear here based on the Court's previous decision and other litigation on this very issue. We have to show a violation of that Order, and that’s what we have just gone through. And we have to show that it is made with knowledge, and it is willful beyond a reasonable doubt. I would remind the Court that on Monday, April 23rd, Mr. Blanche in court with the Defendant sitting right next to him, said the following about the defendant’s knowledge of the Order, and this is from the transcript on April 23rd, page 964, line 10 to 15: There is, just to set the record very straight and clear, President Trump does, in fact, know what the Gag Order allows him to do and not allow him to do. And there was absolutely no willful violation of the Gag Order in the ten posts released by the campaign or what the People just discussed."

We are asking the Court, again, to impose the maximum $1,000 fine for each of the four violations. Because each of these statements was made before the Court held the Defendant in contempt for violating this Order nine previous times, and because we prefer to minimize disruptions to this proceeding, we are not yet seeking jail.

And while we disagree with the Court's Order, to some context, we are guided this morning in what I am going to say to the Court by what the Court said to us on Tuesday. First, the purpose of the Gag Order, your Honor, is to restrict extrajudicial statements in Order to protect the integrity of these proceedings by shielding those fearful of reprisal by the Defendant so that they may take part in these proceedings without concern. And as I will get to in a few minutes, your Honor, that concept alone is reason enough to deny the four that we are here about this morning. And I know that the Court has stated repeatedly that the Gag Order, and your Honor’s intention is not to allow unfettered attacks on President Trump, recognizing he is running for President. Doing a campaign every day, part of the campaign takes place outside of this courtroom, part of the campaign takes place in interviews, meetings with potential voters, whether there is press present and on the campaign trail, and your Honor said it again in the Order on Tuesday. And there is no dispute, I think, among anybody, the Court, or the Government, that political attacks and responses to political attacks does not violate the Gag Order. And I disagree with the People. I disagree that the time that we start looking at what President Trump is responding directly to is the day of the Gag Order. Since President Trump announced his candidacy to run for election this November in ’22, almost two years ago, there have been multiple and repeated attacks on him from, among other people, Michael Cohen, and folks that Michael Cohen has on his podcast regularly. Again, to talk —— I will get more into this in a minute from our exhibits, your Honor, to talk not only about these proceedings, and not only about Mr. Cohen's credibility, and not only attacking President Trump’s credibility, but also attacking him running for President, the qualities he would bring as a leader of this nation and reflecting on the presidency four years ago."

That’s the reason that we are coming at it late, your Honor. So I am going to go in a little bit reverse Order and talk about Mr. Pecker, the alleged violation regarding statements about Mr. Pecker. So what President Trump said, David Pecker, I don’t know exactly what he is going to be testifying about, but he will be testifying today. So, that was a recording, as the Government just said, on April 23rd, for a news show in Philadelphia. It aired about six o'clock that evening. That was in response to a question from the interviewer saying, where is your concern level at this point regarding David Pecker’s testimony and Michael Cohen, but focusing on David Pecker for now? Where is your concern level? President Trump sidestepped the question. He gave a very factual, truthful answer. It wasn’t a warning. It wasn’t a commentary on what Mr. Pecker had testified about, and, certainly, it was not a willful violation. I mean, he is —— he is talking, as the Court knows from the testimony, about a man that he has known for decades. He is talking about a man who he was friends with for decades. There is no threat. There is no threat in what President Trump said, and we cited ten. There are multiple articles. We cited ten of them in our papers, news articles that are going into excruciating details about Mr. Pecker’s testimony. So, when you have President Trump in response to a question saying something completely neutral about the witnesses, there is —— that’s not a willful violation of the Gag Order, when the intent of the Gag Order is to make sure that Mr. Pecker comes in here and testifies without fear of what President Trump has said or will say."

And, so, every time we whisper to our client, it's live—streamed over all sorts of social media outlets, every word the witnesses say, and so then you have President Trump who is asked a question. Everybody is talking about it. What do you think of his testimony, and he doesn't say, I think he is a liar. He better watch out. He says something. He can’t just say, no comment, repeatedly when he is running for President, and I appreciate the Court’s concern, very much so. And we are reacting to what your Honor wrote on Tuesday, but it’s also appropriate to turn to what’s happening with this trial."

President Trump said, he has been very nice. I mean, he has been —— David’s been very nice, a nice guy. And, again, he is responding to a question. Mr. Pecker had been on the stand for two days at this point. The Government says that that's threatening and a warning to witnesses that they need to be nice. That’s just not true. He is just responding to a question and saying he has been very nice. Your Honor observed his testimony. There is no animosity between the two of them. There were no threatening or menacing statements. Again, Mr. Pecker himself testified about their friendship and the relationship, and he would call him Donald and that he had a great relationship with President Trump over the years.

Reposting a photo of President Trump. Next, if we can turn to Exhibit 64, quickly, please. And this one, Mr. Cohen —— this one says, oh my, shits in pants.

We picked four out of a hat. They are all in kind and all similar. So, the response —— and now we are here again on a violation of the Gag Order as it relates to Mr. Cohen, these are responses to repeated and consistent attacks by him against President Trump, his character, his viability as a candidate. And, as you can see, your Honor, it’s also completely throughout the Mea Culpa Podcast and on TikTok. There are repeated attacks on President Trump’s candidacy for President by Mr. Cohen. And if we can go to page —— Exhibit 63, excuse me, and page two, this is —— he is not just doing it to attack. I mean, there are repeated reports and, indeed, they are true, that Mr. Cohen has been shopping television shows based upon, not only what he did for President Trump, but also what he has been doing here. And he is talking about that and advertising what he is trying to do. And then, again, there is multiple examples of this in our exhibits. If we can bring up page 37 —— Exhibit 37, page seven, this is an April 12th, political article quoting Mr. Cohen, talking extensively about President Trump’s candidacy for President, criticizing him, as someone that should not be voted for. On the same article, next page, it says, Donald does not know how to tell the truth. He lied so many times. He can't keep track of the lies.

Multiple. I am not talking about one or two. I am talking multiple, in excess of ten, way in excess of ten. Finally, as has been reported, because it’s true, Mr. Cohen has started going on TikTok nightly and literally making money. So, there is, apparently, a way you can make money with people doing things, while they are watching you on TikTok. He actively encourages folks to give him money. You can see that he has made money. His TikTok repeatedly criticizes President Trump. He said, as recently as April 29th, mocking and almost poking President Trump as it relates to the Gag Order, I am not the Defendant in a criminal matter, and I am not the subject of Judge Merchan’s Gag Order. Donald is, right. And that is after criticizing him extensively. This is not a man that needs protection from the Gag Order. And when you look at what President Trump said about Michael Cohen out here, and then in response to the questions from the interviewer. He wasn’t talking about his testimony at this trial. He was talking about his quality as a lawyer. He was talking about the fact that he was a convicted liar, that he had been prosecuted for lying."

People like, the first one is entitled \"Trump's New York Prosecution is a Bogus Case by Bogus Prosecutors.\" And these articles are by a number of legal commentators, including Jonathan Turley and Andrew McCarthy. These articles are all articles which President Trump would like to post on his Truth, but they all discuss this case. They discuss witnesses who have testified. They discuss what the aspects of the case are. They're very critical of this case. They're important for his election campaign. They're talking about the kinds of issues that he has been raising. But he has some concerns because they do mention witnesses. They mention the prosecutors in this case by name. We think they are perfectly fine, but we think there is some ambiguity in the Gag Order.

I just want to let you know now so you can plan ahead. Jurors, I ask you to, please, not talk amongst yourselves or with anyone else about anything related to the case. Please continue to keep an open mind. Do not form or express an opinion about the defendant's guilt or innocence until all of the evidence is in and I have given you my final instructions on the law and you begin your deliberations. Do not request, accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return for supplying any information concerning this trial. Report directly to me any incident within your knowledge involving an attempt by any person to improperly influence you or any member of the jury. Do not visit or view any of the locations discussed in the testimony. And do not use any program or electronic device to search for and view any location discussed in the testimony. Do not read, view or listen to any accounts or discussions of the case. That includes the reading or the listening to the reading of any transcripts of the trial or the reading of any posts on any court site. Please do not communicate with anyone about the case by any means, including by telephone, text messages, email, or the internet. Again, do not attempt to research any fact, issue or law related to the case. And, please, do not Google or otherwise search for any information about the case or the law which applies to the case, or the people involved in the case. Thank you. Have a good night. And I will see you tomorrow."

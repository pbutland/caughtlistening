Jury Trial — Hearing
1808
1 to be testifying a hour or two after the Defendant made
2 that statement.
3 As I said the other day, the Defendant knows what
4 he is doing. He talks about the testifying witness, says
5 nice things, does it in front of the cameras.
6 To be clear, he was asked other questions about
7 this case and ignored them. So this was not just the
8 Defendant responding to everything the reporters were
9 asking him. He selectively responded to this question and
10 not others.
11 The one he answered was about the witness who was
12 testifying. It was deliberate, and it was calculating.
13 Pecker, be nice. Everyone is hearing this. I
14 have a platform, and I will talk about you, so be nice.
15 What the defense counsel described as innocuous
16 statements about Mr. Pecker on page five of their memo, is
17 anything but. They are deliberate shots across the bow to
18 everyone that may come to this courtroom to tell the truth
19 about the Defendant and what he did.
20 Moving on to the third statement that I will talk
21 about, which this time it is also the third statement in
22 the Order to Show Cause, and it’s Exhibit G in the
23 Affirmation that I filed.
24 This is from an interview that the Defendant gave
25 to a Pennsylvania TV station on the morning of Tuesday,

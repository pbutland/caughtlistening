Jury Trial — Hearing
1829
1 This was sent after the Gag Order was put in
2 place.
3 Exhibit 67, please.
4 Again, from Mr. Cohen criticizing, again, your
5 attacks on me stink of desperation. We are all hoping that
6 you take the stand in your Defense, with a picture of
7 President Trump in this courtroom. And, again, that is on
8 April 22nd.
9 And then, finally, Exhibit 110.
10 Again, this is —— this is before the Gag Order,
11 your Honor, April 4th. But, again, this is not necessarily
12 Mr. Cohen criticizing President Trump about this trial, but
13 about his business and his business ventures, your Honor.
14 So, again, there is a lot more. We picked four
15 out of a hat. They are all in kind and all similar.
16 So, the response —— and now we are here again on
17 a violation of the Gag Order as it relates to Mr. Cohen,
18 these are responses to repeated and consistent attacks by
19 him against President Trump, his character, his viability
20 as a candidate. And, as you can see, your Honor, it’s also
21 completely throughout the Mea Culpa Podcast and on TikTok.
22 There are repeated attacks on President Trump’s
23 candidacy for President by Mr. Cohen.
24 And if we can go to page —— Exhibit 63, excuse
25 me, and page two, this is —— he is not just doing it to

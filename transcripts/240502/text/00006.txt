Jury Trial — Hearing
1809
1 April 23rd. It didn’t actually air until that evening, and
2 the statement is as follows:
3 Well, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar, and he
4 has got no credibility whatsoever. He was a lawyer and you
5 rely on your lawyers. But Michael Cohen was a convicted
6 lawyer. He was a lawyer for many people, not just me, and
7 he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did
8 for me.
9 Largely, it was essentially all because of what
10 he did in terms of the campaign. I don’t think there was
11 anything wrong with that, with the charges that they made,
12 but what he did is —— is he did some pretty bad things, I
13 guess, with banking or whatever. If it was a personal
14 thing to him.
15 David Pecker, I don't know exactly what he’s
16 going to be testifying against but —— or about. He will be
17 testifying today.
18 Again, no question this is related to this
19 proceeding. The Defendant is talking about two witnesses,
20 one of whom was on the stand at the time in the middle of
21 testimony.
22 It’s clearly willful, clearly knowing.
23 The Defendant thinks the rules should be
24 different for him. I talked a bit about the impact of
25 comments about a testifying witness, perhaps not on that

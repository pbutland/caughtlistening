Jury Trial — Hearing
1834
1 MR. BLANCHE: Judge, again, we moved to the jury,
2 and I am done with Mr. Cohen.
3 But Mr. Cohen, and the same things in our papers
4 with respect to Ms. Daniels, where, when you go back, the
5 Court goes back and looks at the purpose of the Gag Order,
6 as opposed to just blindly looking at the statements that
7 are made by President Trump, it’s not violating.
8 I mean, the Constitutional limits that you put on
9 the Gag Order, that your Honor put on the Gag Order, are
10 for good reasons.
11 Because President Trump has to be able to talk
12 extensively and to respond to questions in a way that don't
13 violate the integrity of these proceedings.
14 And as we said today, Mr. Cohen should not be
15 part of this Gag Order. He does not need to be protected.
16 The same is true for Ms. Daniels. She is not
17 part of the four statements, but she is very similar,
18 although not as voluminous, comments about President Trump
19 personal, candidacy for Presidency and how he was president
20 last time.
21 They are not people that need to be protected,
22 and to the contrary, he has to be able to respond to those,
23 Judge.
24 THE COURT: I understand your argument.
25 Thank you.

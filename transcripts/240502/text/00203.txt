3 MR. CONROY: And if we could blow that up a little
4 bit.

6 Q Is this the metadata for this audio recording?
7 A It is.
8 Q And can you walk us through the columns here and walk
9 us through the title and what kind of file this is and the date
10 and time it’s created?
11 A The title is entitled "New Recording 3," which
12 indicates that there are two previous recordings on the Voice
13 Memo app on the iPhone.
14 It’s just an audio recording; it’s on the app, which is the
15 audio recording software.
16 It gives the date and timestamp of September 6th, 2016 at
17 approximately 10:56:42 a.m. in the morning, Eastern Standard
18 Time, with a duration of two minutes and 51 seconds.
19 The Link is just the name of the file again.
20 And the end is just the source.
21 Every file has a source path where it exists on the device.
22 Q Now, People’s 246 is an audio file. It’s not a
23 recording that you were able to forensically extract from CP1;
24 right?
25 A That is correct.

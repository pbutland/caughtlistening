Davidson — Cross/Bove
1933
1 District Attorney's office?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And did you search your files for the signed version of
4 this letter?
5 A. I believe so.
6 Q. And is it fair to say you did not find one?
7 A. I provided whatever was located.
8 Q. My point is: There was nothing wrong in terms of your
9 relationship with Ms. McDougal that it wasn't signed?
10 A. It was my recollection that I had a fully executed ——
ll excuse me —— a Retention Agreement with Ms. McDougal.
12 MR. BOVE: Mr. Bernik, can we take a look at
13 Paragraph 4.2 and the subparagraphs.
14 (Displayed.)
15 Q. I am focused on Paragraph 4.2, where it seems to
16 indicate that the fee contemplated in this letter was 35
17 percent.
18 Do you see that?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Do you recall a subsequent negotiation that increased
21 your fee to 45 percent?
22 A. I don't recall that conversation.
23 Q. And now the difference between these two numbers, 35
24 and 45 percent, on the $150,000 payment, is 10 percent, about
25 15 grand, right?

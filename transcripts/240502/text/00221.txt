1 Q The zip file, that's pulled off of the extraction.
2 When a file is that big and it's pulled off in that way,
3 there is some risk that the data can degrade; is that correct?
4 A So once the data is pulled off, it's then hashed or
5 checks are done, which means that entire file gets a very unique
6 number that says this is the hash that contains all these
7 contents. If anything was affected, that hash file would
8 change.
9 Q Thank you. That's right where I was going.
10 So the hash value associated with the particular giant zip
11 file is like a digital fingerprint; right?
12 A It's a digital fingerprint.
13 Q Maybe even more detailed, like DNA for us; right?
14 A Sure.
15 Q If you trust the hash system you are using, if one of
16 those files with ones or zeroes changes, it's a different hash
17 value; correct?
18 A That's correct.
19 Q And this is a way to check on an ongoing basis the
20 integrity of the data that you are working with; right?
21 A Absolutely.
22 Q And it's a way to ensure that over points in time
23 during the acquisition and review process that the data itself
24 has not been manipulated; right?
25 A Each time you look at it, it hashes or verifies it each

1 Q So, thousands of phones?
2 A Yes.
3 Q Does HTAU have a standard intake procedure for when
4 the Unit receives digital evidence?
5 A We do.
6 Q Can you describe that intake procedure that HTAU uses?
7 A So, once an intake email is set up from the attorneys
8 to our Department, typically, devices will come in either
9 pursuant to a Search Warrant or a Consent Form. Those devices
10 then come to our office. We will examine them, take pictures of
11 them, label them, keep records of those licenses, and then
12 produce Chain of Custody Forms, and then begin the extractions
13 and analysis.
14 Q Would it be routine to —— for the person doing intake
15 to know what authority HTAU has to do the search of the device?
16 A We don’t do any devices without such.
17 Q That's where you mentioned Search Warrant or Consent?
18 A That is correct.
19 Q Briefly, what is a Search Warrant?
20 A A Search Warrant is authority from a judge that signs,
21 that allows us to examine the devices obtained for our Search
22 Warrant.
23 Q What is Consent?
24 A Consent, just simply, the owner of the device consents
25 to the examination of the device.

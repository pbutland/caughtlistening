1 Q What is People's 266?
2 A This is the information about the recording.
3 Q Is this the metadata for that recording?
4 A It is.
5 Q And what's the title of that recording?
6 A The title was labeled "Keith Davidson, October 16th,
7 2017."
8 Q And was that recording made, if you know, on
9 October 16th, 2017?
10 A It was.
11 Q And how do you know that?
12 A Based upon the application called "Voice Memos," how it
13 names the file itself and keeps track of the timestamp, that is
14 embedded within the file.
15 Q And do we see that same date in some of the other
16 columns?
17 A Yes, we do.
18 Q Including in the timestamp date column?
19 A That is correct.
20 Q And also the timestamp time column?
21 A Yes.
22 Q And, again, that's all metadata forensically extracted
23 from CP2?
24 A That is correct.
25 Q Now, can we look at People's 247.

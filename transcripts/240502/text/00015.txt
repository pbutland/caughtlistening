Jury Trial — Hearing
1818
1 THE COURT: You are saying that he can’t respond
2 to what President Biden said without saying Stormy, Stormy
3 Daniels?
4 MR. BLANCHE: That’s exactly what I am saying.
5 He cannot respond without saying Stormy Daniels,
6 your Honor. He is not allowed to.
7 THE COURT: No, he is not allowed to refer to a
8 foreseeable witness in the case. He is certainly allowed
9 to respond to something said by President Biden. There is
10 nothing in the Gag Order that says he can’t.
11 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, I am not saying that he
12 is not allowed to respond to President Biden, but he is
13 limited in what he can say. President Biden is not
14 limited.
15 So, President Biden can make a reference to this
16 trial and to a witness in this trial. President Trump can
17 respond about certain parts of this trial and, your Honor,
18 that’s just my opening point. That that happened this past
19 weekend is to give context to the four statements, which is
20 the reason why we are here today.
21 In addition to the exhibits that were attached on
22 Monday evening, your Honor, we are also going to hand up to
23 the Court and the Government shortly exhibits we will
24 offer, and they are Exhibit 61 through 126.
25 These exhibits are mostly tweets or re—tweets by

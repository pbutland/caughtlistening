1833

2 THE COURT: So, I am not accepting your argument,

6 MR. BLANCHE: Pardon me.
7 THE COURT: And he said that the jury was

10 jury.
11 That’s the implication that was given to anybody
12 that heard that comment. This is not a fair jury.
13 MR. BLANCHE: The Gag Order specifically
14 references any prospective juror or any juror in this
15 criminal proceeding.

17 Democrat or —— which by the way, the press has noted and
18 the press has highlighted. And the press has put on the
19 screens who is democrat and who is not registered.

23 THE COURT: Okay. It’s ten after ten.
24 Is there anything you would like to say just to

1 A. This is 2018; yes? I don’t know what time you are
2 referring to.
3 Q. When you said what is written on the page, were you
4 referring in substance to something that Ms. Daniels had
5 conveyed to you?
6 A. I don’t believe so.
7 Q. And when you use —— do you see where it says
8 "hypothetically speaking?"
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. That was a code, right?
11 A. No.
12 Q. Because you were using the word "hypothetical," so you
13 could sit in a chair like this and say, "I’m not sure if I was
14 talking about Stormy Daniels?"
15 A. No.
16 Q. Do you recall saying during the same conversation with
17 Mr. Cohen, "Well, if things don’t turn out the way that you
18 thought they were going to turn out, and now you’re realizing
19 you have a lot more leverage, you tried to settle it twice?"
20 A. Can I see the transcript?
21 Q. Yes.
22 A. Thank you.
23 MR. BOVE: So we're going to bring up Defense
24 Exhibit F15—AT again.

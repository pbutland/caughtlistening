K. Davidson — Direct/Steinglass
1862
1 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.
2 And I am now displaying publicly People’s
3 Exhibit 255, starting on Page 1.
4 And I am going to ask that we blow up —— thank
5 you —— lines 1 and 2.
6 Q And kind of the way we did with the Exhibit 176A, I’m
7 just going to ask you to read some of these text back and forth
8 and explain what they mean.
9 And give us the date when appropriate.
10 So starting with this top one. What is the date of these
11 blown—up texts?
12 A January 10th, 2018.
13 Q And who is that first one from and who is it to?
14 A From me to Michael Cohen.
15 Q And what is the body of the texts or instant message?
16 A You know, when I look at this —— I think earlier I
17 testified that that email that I sent to the Wall Street
18 Journal, they called me for a comment.
19 Now that I read this, it makes me think that maybe they
20 called her for comment and I responded on her behalf, for
21 whatever that’s worth.
22 Q Thank you for clarifying that.
23 A Thanks.
24 Q You can proceed, please.
25 A Okay. WSJ —— the Wall Street Journal —— called

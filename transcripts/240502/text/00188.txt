1 Q Thank you.
2 MR. CONROY: You can take that down.
3 Q When you received the phones to forensically examine,
4 do you recall if CPl and CP2 were powered on or powered off?
5 A They were off.
6 Q Did each of these two devices go through the intake
7 process, as you just described for us?
8 A Yes, they did.
9 Q Did you do the intake yourself?
10 A I did not.
11 Q Once you were assigned the phones, what did you do
12 with them?
13 A Once I received the phones, I kind of mentioned
14 before, I take them to what’s called our F Room, our Faraday
15 Room. F—A—R—A—D—A—Y. It’s a room that separates the room from
16 outside sources so there’s no interference.
17 We’ll then plug that into a device, hardware device, and
18 then proceed, after given the passcode, to extract the data
19 from the device.
20 Q Once you did all of that, did you end up with a full
21 forensic extraction on each of the data on CPl and CP2?
22 A It was a full extraction.
23 Q We talked a little about this. In layman's terms,
24 could you explain for the members of the jury what "full
25 forensic extraction" means?

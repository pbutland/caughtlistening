K. Davidson — Direct/Steinglass
1870
1 "Let her do her thing, but no interviews at all with anyone."
2 Q And did you respond?
3 MR. STEINGLASS: I think we need to blow up one
4 more text here.
5 (Displayed.)
6 A "100 percent."
7 MR. STEINGLASS: Can we have them together,
8 please.
9 (Displayed.)
10 Q Okay. Mr. Davidson, what did you understand Michael
11 Cohen's text to mean when he said "The wise men all believe the
12 story is dying and she shouldn’t do any interviews"?
13 A Again, that this was sort of in one of his pants on
14 fire stages and that he was running around planning things.
15 And then when he ran it up the flag pole or consulted
16 someone or some group, whoever "wise men" are, that they didn't
17 think that it was a good idea for her to actually appear on
18 Hannity.
19 Q And, to your knowledge, did she appear on Hannity?
20 A She never appeared on Hannity, to my knowledge.
21 Q Okay. And just turning your attention to the next
22 page, continuing this same exchange, how does —— after you say
23 "100 percent," how does Michael Cohen respond?
24 A "Thanks, pal."
25 Q And does he send a follow—up text after that?

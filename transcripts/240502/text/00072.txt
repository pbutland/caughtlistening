1 was appearing on Jimmy Kimmel —— and he wanted to know whether
2 or not she was going to release it.
3 Q Okay. I want to show you Page 9, just to continue
4 this, of the same exhibit, lines 86 through 87.
5 And, again, I would just ask you to tell us who is texting
6 who when and what it means?
7 A This is January 30th, 2018, from me to Michael Cohen.
8 Quote: "She's good for now... but it's a shit load of work."
9 Q But what did you mean by that? What was a lot of
10 work?
11 A Just this case had begun to eat up a lot of time.
12 Q And how did Michael Cohen respond?
13 A "I'm sorry but thank you."
14 Q And so you just referenced another statement. Did you,
15 in fact, prepare another denial for her to sign immediately
16 prior to her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel?
17 A There was another statement that was prepared and
18 released.
19 Q Okay. Let me show you People's Exhibit 278. This is
20 in evidence.
21 MR. STEINGLASS: I will ask that we blow it up a
22 little bit.
23 Q And I will ask you, is this the statement of denial
24 from January 30th, 2018?
25 A Yes.

8 Q Mr. Davidson, you don’t know the day of that
9 recording; do you?
10 A Not offhand.
11 Q And, so, when you’re interpreting words of Michael
12 Cohen, without understanding the date, you don’t know what
13 conversations had taken place by that time between you and
14 Mr. Cohen; do you?
15 A I don't understand your question.
16 Q You have no frame of reference for when that was said
17 in the context of all the other events that you testified about
18 today; right?
19 A No, I have a pretty good understanding of the context.
20 Q My question is not the date, sir.
21 You don’t know when the conversation occurred, as you sit
22 here; do you?
23 A Not offhand.
24 Q And you were asked questions by Mr. Steinglass about
25 the recordings that you and I discussed; right?

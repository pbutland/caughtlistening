Davidson â€” Cross/Bove
1959
1 A. Yes. But I think you are grossly mistaken about it.
2 Q. There is no question pending.
3 MR. STEINGLASS: Objection.
4 I would ask that the witness be allowed to answer.
5 THE COURT: You can go ahead and answer the
6 question.
7 A. I think you are grossly mistaken about the date. This
8 is years after the settlement, and this is talking about a
9 potential breach, where Larry Flynt had offered to give
10 Ms. Daniels 1 million dollars plus indemnify her from any legal
11 costs because she wanted to get out of the Settlement Agreement
12 that she had entered into two years before.
13 Q. Which is shorthand for "settler's remorse," correct,
14 which was your phrase?
15 A. That's true.
16 Q. Now, at some point, Ms. Daniels got new counsel, right?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Michael Avenatti?
19 A. True.
20 Q. And Gina Rodriguez continued to work with Ms. Daniels
21 in that timeframe, right?
22 A. For a period.
23 Q. So for some period of time Ms. Daniels' legal
24 representation was Mr. Avennati, assisted in that agent capacity
25 that we talked about by Gina Rodriguez?

I note on Page 123, Mr. Bove, at Line 20, says, \"I think we’re basically on the same page.\" And then, on 1224, you express your concern. And your concern is, \"At some point, cumulatively, it becomes cumulatively prejudicial.\" So, I appreciate your concern, and I agree that there could come a point where it will possibly become prejudicial. The difficulty is, I don't know at this point what that’s going to be. So we’re just going to have to keep going through it. You'll make your objections. I'll consider the objections. And at some point, we may get there. I am relying, primarily, on People v. Settles, S—E—T—T—L—E—S, 46 N.Y.2d 154, at Page 169. This is a Court of Appeals decision. \"Naturally, there can be no precise demarkation or formulation of the proof which will constitute sufficient support of evidence of a declaration against penal interests. By its very nature, the determination involves a delicate balance of diverse factors and is entrusted to the sound judgment of the trial court which is aptly suited to weigh the circumstances surrounding the declaration and the evidence used to bolster its reliability.\" So, that's really what’s going to guide this Court. But, the fact that you said you’re pretty much on the same page, we're in agreement with who is a co—conspirator in this case: Dylan Howard. We’re in agreement that at least some, if not most, of the responses are coming in for some purpose. And we’re also in agreement that there will be redactions to that."

Next. I think, again, whether intentionally or unintentionally, Mr. Bove's questioning yesterday improperly conflated the federal prosecutors and state prosecutors, referring to both as \"the Government\". Of course, that's, you know —— the state prosecutors are referred to as \"the People\". I am not telling Mr. Bove how to refer to us, if that's how he chooses to refer to us. But, I do think he needs to be clear when he's questioning the witness about prior interviews, which prosecutors he is talking about.

You heard testimony yesterday about the prosecution speaking to Mr. Pecker about the case before the witness testified at this trial. The law permits the prosecution or an attorney to speak to a witness about a case before the witness testifies and permits the prosecution or an attorney to review with the witness the questions that will or may be asked at trial, including questions that may be asked on cross—examination. You have also heard testimony that a witness, Mr. Pecker, read or reviewed certain materials pertaining to this case before he testified at trial. The law permits a witness to do so. Speaking to a witness about his or her testimony and permitting a witness to review materials pertaining to the case before the witness testifies is a normal part of preparing for trial. It is not improper, as long as it is not suggested that the witness depart from the truth. Mr. Bove."

This includes visiting any court sites. I emphasize that in addition to not talking face to face with anyone about the case, you must not communicate with anyone about the case by any other means, including by telephone, text messages, email, chat rooms, blogs or social websites.

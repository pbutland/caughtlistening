They didn't designate any. So —— and we specifically raised the spectre of the defense trying to make our witnesses their own and back door that preclusion by trying to put in nonresponsive exhibits, which are really case in chief exhibits, under the guise that this is cross—examination. Now, this is fully beyond the scope of the direct examination. We didn't ask a single question about the President's travel schedule or the President—Elect's travel schedule. And to top it all off, these travel schedule exhibits are from October. She testified she wasn't even there at Trump Tower or working with the defendant until after Election Day.

And, in substance, there is a question, what are your views on campaign finance reform? And part of what President Trump said in response to that in 1999 is that he is very experienced with the campaign finance laws, and I think the clip is limited to just about that. Our position is that that is not relevant with respect to President Trump’s state of mind in 2016 and 2017 because there has been extensive revisions to the campaign finance laws in the intervening period, both statutory and in the Supreme Court. Whatever President Trump may have said in 1999 about his knowledge of the campaign finance laws is not probative of his state of mind in 2016 and 2017."

We understand that there were, as Mr. Bove noted, extensive changes to campaign finance laws in 2002. We believe that’s a reference to the McCain/Feingold Act. However, the separate contribution ban, which is the one that’s relevant here, has been part of campaign finance laws since 1907, so close to 90 years before Mr. Trump made the admission in that video. And to the extent that defense counsel argues that the clip predates the relevant time period, that’s an issue that goes to weight and not admissibility."

I wouldn’t be surprised if there ends up being a foundation for a missing witness instruction about the uncalled witnesses being equally unavailable to both sides. His posture in this trial is as a hearsay declarant, which the Government is using, basically, in that capacity as a witness. Their theory is he conspired, I think, with Mr. Cohen; that he gave instructions to Mr. McConney. He is in that way, I submit, an uncalled Government witness. To offer this Agreement, which I think would be offered as a way to sort of impeach their own hearsay declarant and suggest there’s some kind of bias and motive that he has to either not be here or acting in a certain way, raises a number of complexities in light of Mr. Weisselberg's overall situation. We think it’s unduly prejudicial. And it’s not particularly relevant, especially in a situation where they are offering —— where the Government is offering his statements. I think this would look differently if we had sought to offer hearsay from him. That’s not what we were doing."

And I think the Government is probably in a similar situation. He is, in effect, their witness at this trial as a hearsay declarant. In that way, we don’t think the Government is able to impeach their own hearsay declarant, even in this form of impeachment, that he entered into a Settlement Agreement after—the—fact, based on a host of situations that we don’t think is relevant at this trial.

And what we are looking to do is explain, from our perspective, why he's not here. I am sure there will be arguments made by Counsel about whether he should have been here and what not being here means. I think we need this Agreement. Our view is that Mr. Weisselberg’s interests right now are very aligned with the Defendant’s. I think this Agreement points that out. Among other things, there are three payments due Mr. Weisselberg during this calendar year for $250,000 each; one in June, one in September, and one in December. Also, if you take a look at the Agreement, particularly in Section 3, Employee Promises, in 3(B): The employee promises not to verbally or in writing disparage, criticize or denigrate the company or any of its current or former entities, directors, managers, employees, owners or representatives. In Sub D, under 3: The employee promises that, except for acts or testimony directly compelled by subpoena or other lawful process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, he will not communicate with, provide information to or otherwise cooperate in any way with any other —— with any other person or entity, including his counsel or other agents having or claiming to have any adverse claims against the company, or any person or entity released by this Agreement with regard to the adverse claims, or to take any action to induce, encourage, instigate, aid, abet, or otherwise cause any person or entity to bring or file a complaint, charge, lawsuit or other proceeding of any kind against the company or any person or entity released by this Agreement. Those are just a couple of the provisions. And Counsel referred to trying to impeach his credibility. We’re not trying to do that. What we’re trying to do is explain his absence. I think, or I would submit, that this Agreement offers a real explanation for why he is not going to be here in this trial."

    "text": "We just, respectfully, disagree with that. This Agreement is not the reason that Mr. Weisselberg is not at this trial. Jeff McConney has a substantial similar Agreement that is in evidence, but he testified at this trial. And his availability or lack thereof is much more straight—forward, has similar terms. Nobody tried to invoke that Agreement to prevent him from testifying. That’s just not the case. That's not the reason Mr. Weisselberg is not here. The reason Mr. Weisselberg is not a witness to either side is because the District Attorney’s Office initiated a perjury prosecution in the lead—up to this case. Even that sentence, I know, is a very complicated sentence, Judge. My point is, to get into any of this, it would all have to come out. It’s just a rabbit hole that I think is unnecessary for —— and it is being offered to impeach Mr. Weisselberg. It’s being offered to show a bias and a motive that the Government’s own hearsay declarant, they’re saying, has. It’s a much more complicated situation than that. For those reasons, we don’t think it’s relevant. And if it is, it should not come in because of the prejudice."

I think it actually further supports my point, which is, there are a host of reasons that Mr. Weisselberg is not going to be a witness in this case. They, the Government, have chosen to not take steps to call him. It’s a very complicated situation. It’s not completely explained by this document. It would be misleading to allow this document in by itself. It would be further prejudicial —— I'm not suggesting your Honor is requiring for us to stipulate —— for us to stipulate to some negotiated statement about the perjury situation.

Our request is, now that we have one week left in the trial, that he be prohibited from talking. The same way President Trump is. The case law speaks to your Honor having the power to do this. Sheppard v. Maxwell explicitly states: There may be instances where the Court not only needs to stop extrajudicial statements from the parties and the lawyers, but also from the witnesses or court officials. Your Honor, it's Friday. We have a couple of days left. It’s now becoming —— it's becoming a problem every single day that President Trump is not allowed to respond to this witness, but this witness is allowed to continue to talk. He has stated on social media that he’s going to stop talking a couple of different times, and he doesn’t.

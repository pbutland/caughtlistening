And, as I understood it, basically agreeing in principle with the defense objection to the concept that a record that is authenticated at the first level for -- as a business record may still present additional embedded hearsay issues within the record. Following that email, at the Court's direction, we conferred with the Government regarding our pending objections, many of which we had sent on Monday night coming into those proceedings. And we clarified some of them based on your Honor's guidance. We received some feedback from the Government, and I think that the conferral process was helpful. There still are some objections that we have on that secondary level of hearsay, and I'm prepared to walk through those whenever we have the time, given the jury."

    "text": "We are asking the Court to sign this Order to Show Cause to hold the defendant in contempt of this Court's April 1st order -- the Order that has been at issue previously in this case -- for submitting four violations in the last three days: One on April 22nd. That violation was right outside the door to this courtroom in one of the defendant's press -- whatever they are -- conferences that he holds on his way in and out of court in the area that's set up for that purpose outside of the door. And what he said right after Court on the 22nd was:  \"But they call the payments to a lawyer a legal expense in the books.\" \"They didn't call it construction. They didn't say they are building a building.\" \"They called it a payment to a lawyer because, you know, Cohen is a lawyer representing a lot of people over the years.\" \"I'm not the only one.\" \"And wasn't very good in a lot of ways in terms of his representation, but he represented a lot of people.\" \"But he puts in an invoice or whatever, a bill, and they pay and they call it a legal expense.\" \"I got indicted for that.\" And then later -- this was about a nine-minute event outside -- a few minutes later the defendant went on:  \"And when they are going to look at all of the lies that Cohen did in the last trial, he got caught lying in the last trial, so he got caught lying, pure lying, and when are they going to look at that.\" That same night on a news program the defendant called in and said the following, in the course of about a 20-minute interview, and this is the second violation we are asking the Court to consider. And the quote is:  \"But this Judge said that I can't get away from the trial. You know, he's rushing the trial like crazy. Nobody has ever seen a thing go like this. That jury was picked so fast. Ninety-five percent Democrats. The area is mostly all Democrats. You think of it as just a purely Democratic area. It's a very unfair situation, that I can tell you.\" That was not more than several hours before the hearing on Tuesday related to his previous violations. On Tuesday morning, the 23rd, the day of that hearing, before the hearing, the defendant gave an interview to a TV station that actually aired that night. And that interview included the following statement by the defendant:  \"Well, Michael Cohen is a convicted liar and he has no credibility whatsoever.\" \"He was a lawyer. And he relied on the lawyers, but Michael Cohen was a convicted liar.\" \"He was a lawyer for many people, not just me, and he got in trouble because of things outside of what he did for me.\" \"Largely, it was essentially all because of what he did in terms of the campaign.\" \"I don't think there was anything wrong with that, with the charges that they made, but what he did is, he did some pretty bad things, I guess, with banking or whatever, if that was a personal thing to him.\" \"David Pecker, I don't know exactly what he's going to be testifying against, but -- or about -- but he will be testifying today.\" That's the defendant talking about witnesses in the case, including one on the stand. He's talking about jurors. He's doing what the Order tells him not to do. And there is a decision pending right now on previous violations. This morning, Judge, the defendant had a press event on 49th Street and Park Avenue here in Manhattan. In that event he was asked the following question:  \"What have you thought of David Pecker's testimony so far?\" \"When was the last time you spoke to him?\" And the defendant said:  \"He has been very nice. I mean, he has been -- I mean, Dave has been very nice, a nice guy. In about five minutes or less, David Pecker's going to walk into this room to continue testifying.\" \"This is a message to Pecker:  Be nice.\" \"It's a message to others:  I have a platform, and I will talk about you and I can say things like this, or things like what I said about Cohen.\" \"It's a message to everyone involved in this proceeding, including this Court.\" We are asking your Honor to sign this Order. We are seeking to have the Court find the defendant in criminal contempt and to impose appropriate sanctions. Thank you."

He -- Dylan, also mentioned that Karen McDougal said that she didn't want her story to be published. She said she didn't want to be the next Monica Lewinsky.

He developed -- he founded all of those magazines. He also found -- he also discovered Arnold Schwarzenegger, and those guys. I should say that Joe Weider and Arnold Schwarzenegger had a relationship for 50 years. So when the magazines were being sold, and I went to see Joe Weider right before the sale, he said to me:  \"Before we finalize this transaction, you have to meet with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" So I -- he gave me his phone number. I called up Schwarzenegger. I went to see him, and he had the following conversation with me: He said that, you know, \"I have been on the covers of Muscle Fitness and Flex, two of the primary magazines you are buying, 70 to 80 times.\" He said:  \"I want to be an Editor-at-Large for both magazines.\" And I would like a -- \"I want an agreement.\" And he said:  \"I'm\" -- And he said:  \"You bought the tabloids.\" He's referring to primarily the Globe and the National Enquirer. And he said, and as I mentioned, I think, on Monday, we acquired them in March of 1999. He said that:  \"I've had a number of litigation and lawsuits against both magazines because you always run negative stories about me.\" And he said:  \"I plan on running for Governor, and I would like for you not to publish any negative stories on me now.\" I should say:  \"Any negative stories about me now or in the future, and I will continue on being the editor for Muscle Fitness and Flex, as the spokesperson.\" So I agreed. And shortly after, he announced on the Jay Leno Show that he was running for Governor. And a number -- after he made that announcement, a number of women called up the National Enquirer about, about -- about stories that they had -- that they have, I should say, to sell on different relationships or contacts and sexual harassment that they felt that Arnold Schwarzenegger did. And the deal that I had -- the agreement, I should say, that I had with Arnold is that I would call him and advise him of any stories that were out there. And I ended up acquiring -- buying them for a period of time. And then as he became Governor -- and one of the stories that I acquired, I wasn't going to publish, and the person who took that story -- and since we didn't -- since the company -- since we didn't publish it, she brought it to the Los Angeles Times and the LA Times published the story. It was very embarrassing. Most of the press approached Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was Governor about this story. And his comment was:  \"I didn't know.\" He said:  \"Ask my friend David Pecker.\" So it was very embarrassing to me and the company. And at that time there was an investigation by the State with respect to Arnold being the editor of -- being an Editor-at-Large for these two titles. He had to resign. And it was a difficult situation. And it gave me the sensitivity about buying any stories in the future. So that's where -- that's how I became sensitive on this topic."

    "text": "That is an invoice from Investment Advisory Services. This is not an American Media company. This company is owned by a man by the name of Daniel Rotstein. Daniel Rotstein was the head of human resources and the head of administration for American Media for probably close to 20 years. And he -- he resided with the company and he took a position -- and he took a position as an executive of the -- in the -- he lives in Florida. I think it's in Plantation, and he was working there four-days a week. Daniel Rotstein was a very valuable employee to me and I wanted to keep the relationship. So, I asked him if he would still continue to work for American Media as a consultant. He did performing these services and administration services. And what -- what another aspect I asked him to do is, when I had large payments to be made on behalf of American Media or something to be received, I requested that Daniel to handle it through his company. And the reason was, is that if I had anything -- if there was a large disbursement within the American Media finance department, they, the finance people, would tell the tabloid editors. For example, if we read that a private plane would fly a celebrity to one place, if we hired certain photographers, paparazzi photographers, I didn't want that type of communication to go through the company. So, to have them outside was much more beneficial. Part is that we had some pretty difficult experiences within the company whereby, the payroll register for American Media, the company based in Florida, was hidden upon each post, and the top executives' salary and compensation was listed right on the front page of the paper. So, I had a number of incidents over the years. So I asked Daniel, Daniel Rotstein, to handle this for me. So, I called him, and said, look, I don't want to have a check from the Trump Organization going through American Media. I don't know exactly how it's going to be reimbursed. So, I would like for you to speak to Michael Cohen directly and work out with him, whereby, you bill him the invoice for $125,000 and reimburse American Media. So, I called Michael Cohen to tell him about -- that Daniel Rotstein would be handling this reimbursement. And I asked Daniel Rotstein to call Michael Cohen directly. I made the introduction. Michael told me that he created a company called, Resolution Consultants, that would -- that we should bill and Daniel Rotstein prepared the agreement, the assignment and the invoice."

Acquiring sources, signing NDAs, releasing sources from NDAs, these are core business practices of AMI. And so, we don't think that this is embedded in hearsay.

We have a couple of issues with this message. We touched on these with the letter we submitted. The bottom message here recounting a series of factual assertions related to Mr. Sajudin should not come in for its truth. It is unduly prejudicial and to be sort of put in front of a jury with a limiting instruction, when there is a very reasonable alternative to making a potential prejudice is to just simply redact this piece. And I think that's particularly appropriate given your Honor's in limine ruling limiting the extent to which facts concerning the Sajudin and McDougal incidents or whatever we call them from coming in. So that's the argument, Judge, for the bottom email. From our perspective, there are the same issues as you continue up the thread. And I think here, just as -- I don't -- just as it's conceded by everybody that Mr. Stracher was not a member of any conspiracy, I don't think there is a foundation now or any argument that Barry Levine of AMI was a member of a conspiracy. So that is an additional impediment to these coming in on any basis."

First of all, we are not, we made this clear both in the letter response and in correspondence to counsel, we are not seeking to admit the bottom portion of the email for its truth. We don't think it is true and we elicited testimony to that point, very clear testimony, from Mr. Pecker that he did not believe Mr. Sajudin story to be true. However, it is necessary context to understand the rest of the email string which is very much about both a business record and co-conspirator statements. So, let me explain why as to both. This is much more akin to Exhibit 164 then it is to Exhibit 169 insofar as it was AMI's business to purchase stories and according to Pecker they used emails to conduct that business and Howard did so as part of his regular course of his job responsibilities. And is, therefore, under a business duty to do so truthfully. This is really just a class in business records. Separately, we believe it's admissible as a co-conspirator statement and has res gestae of the state's election law conspiracy. And let me say first in that regard, and I am going to come back to this with certain other exhibits or portions of exhibits, we have more than established the prima fascia case of conspiracy to promote or prevent election law violations by unlawful means. And that is all we have to do to admit evidence under the co-conspirator hearsay exception to establish a prima facia case, and we have done far more than that. Further, we have elicited sufficient testimony to conclude prima facia that Dylan Howard is a member of the conspiracy, and insofar as -- should I stop?"

Candidate -- this is a text from Mr. Howard to his relative. \"Candidate denies he had an affair. Nevertheless, I'm going to California on Sunday and Monday to interrogate the claim to understand the veracity of her claims. I suspect it's true.\" Response: \"Why would you go to California if you're not going to print it? Answer from Mr. Howard:  \"No, she's American. I'm going for other reasons.\" Response:  \"For the Awards?\" Answer from Mr. Howard:  \"No, for the campaign.\" Answer from the relative:  \"Oh, sorry, I see now.\" Response from Mr. Howard:  \"Mind you, in the event that he's elected, it doesn't hurt, the favors I have done, provided it's kept secret. And I'm assured this mission is known only to me and D.P.,\" which is David Pecker. And the response:  \"Information is powerful.\" Then flipping to Page 4, this is also on the same day in June. Mr. Howard tells his relative:  \"Nothing is on email,\" et cetera. \"Burner phones.\" And another text:  \"I thought about it. Information is powerful, and I'm collecting a lot.\" So this first group of texts, we believe, are admissible as to Howard's state of mind, including declarations of future intent. He is a co-conspirator. As we've already discussed, his state of mind is relative. Declarations of future intent are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and we provided some law, both in our memo and in the cases that I've handed up. Primarily, People versus James. That's 93 N.Y. 2nd 620, at Page 628 to 631, which is Court of Appeals from 1999, which discusses Hillman, which is a U. S. Supreme Court case at 145 U.S. 285. So those texts we believe are admissible on those grounds, a state of mind and declaration of future intent. I think that the text -- there is another category of texts, and we're happy to redact the intervening texts that don't fall into one of these categories. The next -- I skipped one from July 26, 2026, on Page 6 of the exhibit. There is a text, \"I need to meet with Keith tomorrow for Michael Cohen, and we'll return thereafter.\" That falls into that first category. Okay. So, I am sorry. Moving to the second category, which are the election night texts. There is a text from Dylan Howard to his relative that says, \"He's in with a massive chance.\" And then on the next page, Page 7, another text to his relative:  \"At least, if he wins, I'll be pardoned for electoral fraud.\" There is a response from his relative that says: \"Trump victory imminent.\" And on the next page, Page 8, there is a response from Mr. Howard:  \"I get pardoned, so it's fine, nowhere.\" Another text from Mr. Howard to his relative: \"He's just been named President Elect.\" Response: \"Oh, dear.\" Another response --"

So, I said, Donald, there is no way on earth I would leak the story. And we, \"we\" being American Media, had the agreement only between a couple of people, so there is no way we would have given this information or the information to the Wall Street Journal. I said, the only other individual that had the agreement was Karen McDougal. So Karen McDougal or her people or someone from her staff or herself gave it to the Wall Street Journal. Not us. I don't believe that Donald Trump believed it over the phone. He was very agitated. He couldn't understand how this could happen. Our call ended very abruptly."

I do agree with Mr. Bove, the factual statements contained in Ms. Rodriguez's texts should not be considered for the truth, and her portion of the conversation should only be admitted to contextualize Mr. Howard's conversations with her."

Judge, in exercising your discretion about what's going to come in and how at this trial there is a tipping point where there are factual assertions in these documents that are being put in front of the jury, we appreciate the limiting instructions. At some point, cumulatively, it becomes cumulatively prejudicial. It becomes extremely hard during deliberations where the juror sorts through what is the truth, what is not. They can sort through the exhibits. These texts messages, when you look at the assertions Ms. Rodriguez is making, these are very, very substantive and go directly to what's going on. And we're not going to have an opportunity to cross-examine her. That's why we think for these messages, in light of that, they should not come in. They are, admittedly, her statements; are not in furtherance of the conspiracy; and, therefore, to offer them not for their truth is unduly prejudicial to us."

This is core, the conspiracy being enacted in real time in terms of this is the effort to buy up the Stormy Daniels story, discussions about the Stormy Daniels story. It is really a core part of the conspiracy. So, I think any possibility of prejudice can be cured, as it has with several other documents, by instructing the jury that any factual assertions in the Rodriguez portions of those texts should not be considered for the truth, but only to contextualize Mr. Howard's responses. If there's one or two lines that are not necessary to contextualize Ms. Rodriguez's -- Mr. Howard's communications, and Defense Counsel wants to bring those one or two lines to our attention, we can consider whether it's appropriate to redact them. We are not looking to prove the truth of what Ms. Rodriguez is saying. However, what she's saying is semi-important in terms of what AMI's motivation was in terms of buying up that story and preventing it from being released."

And in the first week or the second week of October of 2001, we received multiple Anthrax letters in white envelopes to the various magazines. One of the editors opened up the envelope, inhaled weaponized Anthrax and then -- and ended up dying not too long after that. And at the same time, within a matter of hours or within a day, the FBI took quarantine of the building because the building was filled with Anthrax. I then -- at that time, all of the content that I -- that the tabloids had, photos, stories, was all quarantined and we had to vacate the building, as I said. And I, basically, was in a very, very, difficult place from a business standpoint, a personal standpoint. And the first person who called me, asked if I needed help, was Donald Trump. And he was very helpful. He gave me -- he recommended an attorney. He helped introduce me to -- at that time Sandy Weill was the Chairman of the Travelers Insurance Company, who had the insurance on the building, and helped tremendously in continuing on with my business. So I have no ill will at all. And I still consider him a close -- I still, even though we haven't spoken, I still consider him a friend."

I think Mr. Bove, arguably, laid a foundation to ask about People's A101, which at least contains some reference, a paragraph that references the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting. However, he then showed the witness People's Exhibit A102, which, insofar as I can tell, doesn't have anything at all about the August 2015 meeting. He asked a question:  Did you ever say anything about the presence of Hope Hicks at this meeting? The witness says:  I don't know. I need to see the document. I need to look through it. He wasn't given that opportunity. I objected because I thought that question was improper, because I thought it violated Bornholdt. There was no indication the witness was asked about the August 15th meeting during the interview, and there was no indication that admitting it would be an unnatural omission under People v. Bornholdt. The witness asked to be shown the document so he could look and it and be shown if there was a discussion in the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. I don't see any. Perhaps Counsel sees one. But, I think that was a totally improper line of questioning. I think it left the jury with the misimpression that the witness was asked about it and omitted it. That's a prior inconsistent statement; and I think it's a prior omission by Bornholdt."

Do you have anything you can give me that might refresh my recollection?\", and then you hand him the document, the message that sends to the jury and to everyone else in this room is there's something in that document that's going to refresh your recollection. But, there wasn't anything in that document; and, therefore, it's misleading. So, we're going to correct this tomorrow morning in the presence of the jury. I'm going to ask you to please be very careful with that. I'm not accusing you of having done it deliberately. But, it still left the jury with the misimpression that he had omitted something. If you want to hand him something to refresh his recollection, you should actually hand him something that will actually do it."

We gave notice to the Counsel of the Trump Organization. We will be asking the Court -- my understanding is, Counsel of the Trump Organization will be present tomorrow on the Court's application, except for the very end of the day because of Sabbath observance."

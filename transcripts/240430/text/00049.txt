2 Q But is it your understanding, and I believe you
3 testified to this on Friday, that if a client has a mortgage
4 with the bank, even if the bank decides to no longer have other
5 business with him, the mortgage will often remain, correct?
6 A That is correct.
7 Q Is that true with Mr. Cohen, as far as you know?
8 A Yes.
9 Q Maybe, this is what you were just talking about.
10 Are you familiar with the term de—risk?
11 A I am not familiar with that term, no.
12 Q When a bank determines that there is something about a
13 client, or the type of accounts the client wants to have with
14 the banks, they can decide —— the bank can decide to no longer
15 do business with them, correct?
16 A That's correct.
17 Q And you testified last week, and a little bit today,
18 that there are any number of types of work or types of clients
19 that First Republic may decide they don't want to do work with,
20 right?
21 A That's correct.
22 Q It could be the client himself or herself, correct?
23 A Yes.
24 Q It could be the type of business that client is in,
25 correct?

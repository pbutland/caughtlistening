1 Q How did Dylan Howard respond?
2 A "I'll take it to them but thinking it's more hundreds
3 than millions."
4 Q What did you understand that to mean?
5 A That was —— I should expect a counteroffer that was
6 substantially less than a million.
7 Q Okay.
8 And how did you respond to that?
9 A "800,000 now and 100,000 per year for two years for a
10 total of one million."
11 Q Again, just to make a clear record —— I'm sorry I have
12 to do that each time.
13 "800" means "800,000"; "100" means "100,000"; and "1M"
14 means "one million"?
15 A Yes.
16 Q How did Mr. Howard respond?
17 A "Leave with me."
18 Q How did you take that?
19 A That we really weren't in the same ballpark.
20 Q Okay.

23 exchange takes place on.
24 A July 28th.
25 Q Okay.

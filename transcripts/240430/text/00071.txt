Jury Trial — Colloquy
Page 1647
1 I am handing up to the Court some proposed
2 redactions as to Exhibit 171. The items that are circled
3 in red, those are items that we have agreed to redact
4 beyond what is already blacked out.
5 The three tabbed red items are the remaining
6 points of contention. We did reach a lot of progress on
7 this.
8 THE COURT: Thank you.
9 MR. STEINGLASS: So, would you like me to talk
10 about three?
11 THE COURT: Yes .
12 MR. STEINGLASS: So, the first item in contention
13 is on line 38909, in which Gina Rodriguez says she stopped
14 it a long time ago because he threatened to sue me.
15 Then the next one is on October 19th, and this is
16 in the midst of, you can tell from the context here, in the
17 midst of negotiations over the Stormy Daniels deal and kind
18 of delays that were perceived as happening by Michael
19 Cohen, that Ms. Rodriguez tells Dylan Howard, quote, very
20 shady shit is going on.
21 THE COURT: What line are you on?
22 MR. STEINGLASS: It's 39540. That's on page 10.
23 MR. BLANCHE: Second from the bottom.
24 THE COURT: I see it.
25 MR. STEINGLASS: And then, finally, on page 11,

Davidson — Direct/Steinglass
Page 1799
1 A. I think this was 16 days after the original agreement
2 was entered into: October 16, 2016.
3 Q. What does the body say?
4 A. "Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen. The funds have been
5 deposited into your checking account. Entered in 1897. Best,
6 Lizzie."
7 Q. What did you take it to mean that Michael Cohen
8 forwarded you to this email?
9 A. It meant nothing to me.
10 Q. Why not?
11 A. Because he had my wiring instructions, all he needed to
12 do was wire funds, but he didn't wire funds, he forwarded me an
13 email saying that he had the money, not that he sent the money
14 to me.
15 Q. How would you describe Michael Cohen —— withdrawn.
16 During this time, were you also speaking with Michael
17 Cohen on the phone?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. How would you describe his demeanor during this time?
20 A. He was highly excitable. Sort of a pants on fire kind
21 of guy. He had a lot of things going on. Frequently I would
22 be on the phone with him, he would take another call, he would
23 be talking out of two ears. Sort of like that movie with the
24 dogs and squirrels.
25 THE COURT: Mr. Steinglass, is this a good time to

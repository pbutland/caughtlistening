5 maintained the mortgage accounts and closed out the bank
6 accounts.
7 Q And what is the negative press you are referring to
8 here?
9 A The Stormy Daniels, the one that came out.
10 Q And was that the first time that the bank learned the
11 true nature of those transactions that we discussed?
12 A Yes.

14 THE COURT: Overruled.
15 Q Was Mr. Cohen's accounts, other than his mortgage

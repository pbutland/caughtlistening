11 the next two years as a fitness correspondent for AMI and your
12 related publications?"
13 Q So, you —— you almost translated that text a little
14 bit as you read it; right?
15 The number "1M" you read as "one million"; is that correct?
16 A Would you like me to read it?
17 Q That's fine.
18 A "1M" is one million, yes.
19 Q And "75K" is "75,000"?
20 A Yes.
21 Q I know this sounds silly, but "ur" is shorthand for

23 A Yes.
24 Q And "pubs” is short for "publications"?
25 A Yes.

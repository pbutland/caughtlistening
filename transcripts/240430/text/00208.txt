1 Q. And when you were negotiating the settlement agreement
2 with Michael Cohen, did you have an understanding of who was
3 ultimately going to be responsible for paying Ms. Daniels?
4 A. No.
5 Q. Let me show you privately Grand Jury Page 525. I
6 believe that's People's Exhibit 508A.
7 I am going to ask you, just yourself and the parties
8 and the Judge ——
9 MR. BOVE: I object to this.
10 THE COURT: Approach.
11 (whereupon, proceedings were held at sidebar:)
12 MR. BOVE: The last question was: Do you have an
13 understanding of who was going to be ultimately
14 responsible? I am summarizing. The answer is no.
15 The witness didn't indicate there was any lack of
16 recollection.
17 Now we're basically —— the People's witness ——
18 impeaching their testimony.
19 Either way, it should not be put in front of him
20 right now. The answer is the answer. It should stand.
21 THE COURT: Yes.
22 MR. STEINGLASS: I am deliberately not violating
23 Penal Law 60.35 by not asking him the substance of the
24 previous communication. I am showing it to him to refresh
25 his recollection without disclosing the content.

1 believe, that Mr. Cohen did do work, real estate work at least,
2 and consulting work that was separate and apart from his job at
3 the Trump Organization, correct?
4 A That's correct.
5 Q And, by the way, your basis for knowing that is Mr.
6 Cohen, correct?
7 A Yes.
8 Q What I mean by that, you don't go out and do an
9 internal investigation of Mr. Cohen's real estate deals; he
10 tells you and you accept it, correct?
11 A Yes.
12 Q And there is nothing wrong with you doing that?
13 A I couldn't infringe upon and ask any further questions
14 on that.
15 Q I think you testified you had 1800 clients, is that
16 right, over the time?
17 A Approximately, yes.
18 Q Now, I want to focus a little bit more on
19 October 2016, which you testified about Friday and again this
20 morning.
21 You recall having several phone calls with Mr. Cohen
22 in those few weeks in October 2016?
23 A Thirteen to 26, yes.
24 Q And that's different from your relationship with him
25 the rest of the time?

1 A Yes.
2 Q And that you don't accept any nonsense from clients;
3 correct?
4 A Well, not that I don't accept any nonsense, it's just
5 that I, I try to rationalize with clients that things —— that
6 certain things aren't as urgent as they may seem.
7 Q And Mr. Cohen, I believe you said, you believe he's an
8 aggressive guy. He's a fast speaker, someone who is not the
9 easiest guy to work with if you are not familiar with him; is
10 that a fair way to describe it?
11 A I would say so, yes.
12 Q And, at least, as of March last year, so March of 2023,
13 Mr. Cohen was still your client, this is before you left First
14 Republic; correct?
15 A That is not correct.
16 Q That's not correct; why not?
17 A No. Once this information came out and was publicized
18 in the paper, I was taken away from the relationship.
19 MR. BLANCHE: Can we show the Court, the People and
20 the witness D10, please.

23 you.

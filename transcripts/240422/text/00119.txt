1 THE COURT: Sure.
2 (whereupon, a sidebar took place between the
3 court and counsel:)
4 MR. CONROY: I guess I was wondering if we should
5 put a witness on tomorrow for the various truths. It's not
6 clear to me whether there is an objection to those coming
7 in based on the papers that we received.
8 THE COURT: You consent to the introduction of
9 posts?
10 MR. CONROY: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out
11 how the hearing would work out tomorrow, if we should have
12 witnesses.
13 THE COURT: You have to meet your burden. It's up
14 to you how you are going to do that.
15 How long do you think it will take to present your
16 case?
17 MR. CONROY: Thirtyâ€”five minutes maybe.
18 THE COURT: Okay.
19 MR. CONROY: Somewhere between 30 minutes to an
20 hour.
21 THE COURT: Are you going to present anything?
22 MR. BOVE: We may amplify some of the legal
23 arguments that we made in the briefing. So subject to
24 seeing what comes in in testimony, our plan is not to offer
25 anything additional.

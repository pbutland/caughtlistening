Jury Instructions â€” the Court
Page 848
1 or otherwise is based on our law and expresses no opinion
2 about the facts of the case or whether the defendant is
3 guilty or not guilty.
4 Remember, you are responsible for making that
5 decision.
6 Now, from time to time during the course of the
7 trial, there will be conferences at the bench with counsel
8 and if they become prolonged it may be necessary for the
9 Court to ask the jury to return to the jury room.
10 These conferences that deal with questions and
11 matters of law and scheduling of the trial are my
12 responsibility, so when the occasion arises when there are
13 conferences at the bench or outside of your presence, I ask
14 for your understanding.
15 Upon completion of the presentation of evidence,
16 the lawyers will address you in a closing statement, or what
17 the law calls a summation.
18 What a lawyer says in a summation is not evidence.
19 The summations, however, provide each lawyer an opportunity
20 to review the evidence presented and submit for your
21 consideration the facts, inferences and conclusions which
22 they contend may be properly drawn from the evidence.
23 After summations are concluded, I will instruct you
24 on the rules of law applicable to the case.
25 You must accept and follow those rules.

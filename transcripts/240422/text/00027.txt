1 A witness usually can testify only about matters
2 the witness has personal knowledge of, that is, something
3 the witness has personally seen, heard, felt, touched or
4 tasted.
5 Thus, a witness is not permitted to guess or
6 speculate or say what he or she thinks another person saw,
7 heard, felt, touched or tasted.
8 Also, a witness is not permitted to give an
9 opinion about matters for which a special expertise is
10 necessary unless, of course, the witness purports to be an
11 expert on the matter he or she is being questioned about.

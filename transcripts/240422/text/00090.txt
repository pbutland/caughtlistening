Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche
Page 907
1 Now, I want to talk to you for just a few minutes
2 about what the People spent a long time talking about,
3 which is this catch and kill scheme between Mr. Pecker at
4 AMI and President Trump and Michael Cohen as the part of
5 his lawyer. The People used the word "conspiracy".
6 You will hear and see that there are 34 counts in
7 this indictment. "Conspiracy" is not one of them.
8 President Trump is not charged with any "conspiracy".
9 That’s a word the People have chosen to use.
10 The reality is, there’s nothing illegal about a
11 scheme. There's nothing illegal about what you will hear
12 happened among AMI and National Enquirer and Mr. Pecker
13 and President Trump.
14 It happens —— I expect you will hear shortly,
15 this sort of thing happens regularly, that newspapers make
16 decisions about what to publish, when to publish, and how
17 to publish. It happens with politicians, with wealthy
18 people, with famous people.
19 It’s not a scheme. Unless a scheme means
20 something that doesn’t matter, that’s not illegal, that’s
21 not against the law.
22 As part of this, the People talked about a catch
23 and kill idea. Catch and kill. That you purchase the
24 rights to a story.
25 But, I encourage you to listen over the next

Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche
Page 909
1 And, listen, use your common sense. We’re
2 New Yorkers. That’s why we’re here.
3 You told all of us, you told the Court, you told
4 me, that you would put aside whatever ideas you have of
5 President Trump from the past eight years, the fact that
6 he was President, the fact that he is running again for an
7 election this November. And we trust you to do that. We
8 do. We trust that you’re going to decide this case based
9 upon the evidence that you hear in this courtroom and
10 nothing else.
11 And if you do that, there will be a very swift, a
12 very swift not guilty verdict.
13 Thank you.
14 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Blanche.
15 Counsel, please approach.
16 (Whereupon, the following proceedings were held
17 at sidebar:)
18 THE COURT: I know you want to take a short
19 break. You can do that.
20 But, I need to have the jurors out of here by
21 12:30.
22 MR. STEINGLASS: What time is it now?
23 THE COURT: Ten to twelve.
24 We can put your witness on the stand for ten
25 minutes, maybe fifteen minutes, tops, or we can adjourn

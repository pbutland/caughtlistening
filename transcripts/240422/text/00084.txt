Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche
Page 901
1 has talked extensively about his desire to see President
2 Trump’s family go to prison. He has talked extensively
3 about President Trump getting convicted in this case.
4 As a matter of fact, you will learn that last
5 night, 12 hours ago, Mr. Cohen, on a public forum, said he
6 had a mental excitement about this trial and his
7 testimony. He called President Trump, just last night, a
8 despicable human being, among other things. And he said
9 that he wanted to see President Trump in an orange
10 jumpsuit. That was last night.
11 But, he says similar things multiple times a week
12 during the entire pendency of this case and even before
13 this case was brought.
14 You’ll learn that Mr. Cohen has misrepresented
15 key conversations where the only witness who was present
16 for the conversation was Mr. Cohen and, allegedly,
17 President Trump.
18 He has a goal, an obsession with getting Trump.
19 And you’re going to hear that.
20 I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.
21 Separately from his obsession with President
22 Trump and his obsession to get President Trump, on
23 multiple occasions Mr. Cohen has testified under oath and
24 lied.
25 MR. COLANGELO: Objection.

Jury Trial — Preliminaries/Sandoval Ruling
Page 825
1 At this point, I don't see any reason why a
2 transcript which accurately summarizes what was said in the
3 tape should not be admitted into evidence.
4 MR. STEINGLASS: Thank you.
5 THE COURT: I will hear you on that.
6 MR. BLANCHE: Your Honor, we, obviously, objected
7 for the reasons we put in our letter and the reason we
8 talked about last week and continue to object, but your
9 Honor has ruled.
10 THE COURT: Thank you.
11 Finally, we did have the Sandoval Hearing last
12 week on Friday and I will read my ruling from the bench.
13 This Court conducted a Sandoval Hearing on
14 Friday, April 19, 2024.
15 At that time, the People disclosed the list of
16 all misconduct and criminal acts of the defendant not
17 charged in the indictment, which the People intend to use
18 at trial to impeach the credibility of the defendant
19 pursuant to CPL Section 245.20, subdivision (3 (a).
20 The People referred to six different proceedings
21 involving a total of thirteen determinations.
22 The defendant contends, among other things, that
23 prior conduct is too similar to the crimes to which he is
24 being charged and will permit the jury to infer guilt from
25 propensity based on the priors.

Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche
Page 906
1 improper relationship in writing.
2 You will hear that in the weeks and months
3 leading up to the 2016 election, she saw her chance to
4 make a lot of money, $130,000. And it worked. She got an
5 NBA, and Michael Cohen paid her that money. He did that in
6 exchange for her silence. Which, of course, didn’t work.
7 And since this story came out in 2018, became
8 public, she’s made hundreds of thousands of dollars
9 because of it. She also wrote a book. She was paid for a
10 documentary.
11 And you'll also learn that courts have sided with
12 President Trump in legal disputes between Ms. Daniels and
13 President Trump and that she owes him somewhere around
14 $600,000 as a result of those cases.
15 But, I’m going to say something else about her
16 testimony, and this is important. It doesn't matter.
17 What I mean by that is, I expect you will learn
18 that Ms. —— that Ms. Daniels doesn’t have any idea. She
19 doesn't know anything about the charged 34 counts in this
20 case. She has no idea what Michael Cohen wrote on the
21 invoice. She has no idea how it was booked at Trump Tower.
22 And she has no idea about the checks that are also charged
23 in this indictment.
24 So, her testimony, while salacious, does not
25 matter.

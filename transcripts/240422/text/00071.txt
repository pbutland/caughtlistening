Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche

1 THE COURT: Good morning.
2 MR. BLANCHE: President Trump is innocent.
3 President Trump did not commit any crimes.
4 The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office should
5 never have brought this case. You've heard this a few
6 times already this morning, and you’re going to hear it a
7 lot more during this trial.
8 The People, the Government, they have the burden
9 of proof to prove President Trump guilty beyond a
10 reasonable doubt.
11 What that means, as Judge Merchan said a few
12 minutes ago, is that President Trump is presumed innocent.
13 He’s cloaked in innocence. And that cloak of innocence
14 does not leave President Trump today. It doesn’t leave him
15 at any day during this trial. And it won't leave him when
16 you all deliberate.
17 You will find that he is not guilty.
18 Now, President Trump, you’ve seen him, of course,
19 for years and years and years. You've seen him on
20 television. You’ve seen photos of him. You've seen
21 articles written about him. He’s in some ways larger than
22 life. But, he’s also here in this courtroom doing what any
23 of us would do: defending himself.
24 You’re going to hear me, as I've done already
25 today, and others, even witnesses, refer to him as

Opening Statement — Mr. Blanche

1 That last comment is stricken.
2 MR. BLANCHE: There is nothing illegal about
3 entering into a non—disclosure agreement. Period.
4 Now, the People talked about Michael Cohen. And
5 there are going to be a lot of witnesses in addition to
6 Mr. Cohen. You’re going to hear myself, the other folks
7 that are working with President Trump cross—examine, as
8 the judge talked about, these witnesses. Some we’ll
9 cross—examine a lot. Some very little, if at all.
10 But, one witness who you will hear a lot about is
11 Michael Cohen.
12 Mr. Cohen served as President Trump’s attorney
13 for many years, long before President Trump became
14 President. He served as his personal attorney, working at
15 Trump Tower, being paid for by the Trump companies.
16 And then, as I mentioned, in 2017, he served as
17 his —— as the personal attorney to President Trump in
18 2017, after President Trump took office.
19 You will learn that shortly after the election in
20 2016, Michael Cohen wanted a job in the administration. He
21 didn’t get one.
22 You’ll hear that he was loyal. He was very loyal
23 to President Trump and the companies for years. He
24 defended President Trump on television, in printed media,
25 publicly, privately.

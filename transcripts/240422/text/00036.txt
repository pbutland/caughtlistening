Jury Instructions â€” the Court
Page 853
1 to complete the trial.
2 Our law expects that the first 12 jurors who
3 begin the trial will be the same 12 jurors who complete the
4 trial.
5 So it takes an extraordinary emergency before there
6 may be a substitution of an alternate.
7 Finally, our law requires jurors to follow certain
8 instructions in order to help assure a just and fair trial.
9 And I am required by law to read these admonitions to you
10 whenever we separate.
11 You will hear them countless times during the
12 course of the trial.
13 I will now give you those instructions:
14 Do not speak either among yourselves or with anyone
15 else about anything related to the case.
16 You may tell the people with whom you live or your
17 employer that you are a juror, and give them information
18 about when you will be required to be in court, but you may
19 not talk with them or anyone else about anything related to
20 the case.
21 Do not at any time during the trial request,
22 accept, agree to accept or discuss with any person the
23 receipt or acceptance of any payment or benefit in return
24 for supplying any information concerning the trial.
25 You must promptly report directly to me any

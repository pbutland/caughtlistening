1 defendant guilty.
2 The law uses the terms, proof beyond a reasonable
3 doubt to tell you how convincing the defendant's guilt must
4 be to permit a verdict of guilty. The law recognizes that
5 in dealing with human affairs there are very few things in
6 this world that we know with absolute certainty.
7 Therefore, the law does not require the People to
8 prove a defendant guilty beyond all possible doubt.
9 On the other hand, it is not sufficient to prove
10 that the defendant is probably guilty.
11 In a criminal case the proof of guilt must be
12 stronger than that. It must be beyond a reasonable doubt.
13 A reasonable doubt is an honest doubt of the
14 defendant's guilt for which a reason exists based upon the
15 nature and the quality of the evidence.
16 It is an actual doubt, not an imaginary doubt.
17 It is a doubt that a reasonable person acting in
18 a matter of this importance would be likely to entertain
19 because of the evidence that was presented or because of
20 the lack of convincing evidence.
21 The proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is
22 proof that leaves you so firmly convinced of a defendant's
23 guilt that you have no reasonable doubt of the existence of
24 any element of the crime or of the defendant's identity as
25 the person who committed that crime.

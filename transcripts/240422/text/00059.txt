Opening Statement â€” Mr. Colangelo
Page 876
1 Weisselberg, they agreed that Cohen would make the payment
2 through a shell company to make it harder to track.
3 But before putting up his own money, Cohen
4 confirmed with Trump that Trump would pay him back.
5 And at Trump's request, Cohen agreed to lay out
6 his own money for the payment to keep Stormy Daniels quiet.
7 Two weeks before the presidential election, on the
8 morning of October 26th, 2016, Cohen made two phone calls to
9 the defendant to confirm that he was finalizing the
10 arrangements. You will see the telephone records of those
11 calls.
12 Then Cohen walked across the street, he opened a
13 bank account in the name of a new shell company called
14 Essential Consultants, LLC, which he had created to carry
15 out the Stormy Daniels payoff.
16 He then transferred $131,000 from the home equity
17 line of credit on his own home into the shell company's bank
18 account, and the next day Cohen wired 130 grand to Stormy
19 Daniels' lawyer to keep her quiet.
20 And as part of their efforts to try to keep the
21 entire scheme under wraps, Cohen gave false information to
22 the banks about the shell company's business purpose in the
23 account opening forms he was required to complete and in the
24 wire transfer records that he filled out describing the
25 purpose of the $130,000 payment.

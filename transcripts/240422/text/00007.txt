11 There was also an issue regarding at Access
12 Hollywood tape last week and to what extent the People
13 would be permitted to elicit information about it.
14 I promised I would go back and review the
15 transcript. I did. I don't really see the confusion.
16 The issue of the People introducing a transcript
17 was never raised or not raised or what was raised was that
18 the People would be permitted to go into what was discussed
19 in the Access Hollywood tape and that the tape would not be
20 played.
21 If the People were to request and seek to
22 introduce a transcript, I would hear argument of both sides
23 as a matter of evidence, not as a matter of this is the
24 Access Hollywood tape and, therefore, some special rule
25 applies.

1 witnesses. The Court may at times ask a witness a
2 question. The jurors may not ask questions of the
3 witnesses.
4 You may, but are not required, to take notes. If
5 you wish to take notes we will provide materials to you for
6 that purpose. If you decide to take notes, you must follow
7 these rules.
8 Remember, every word of each witness is recorded
9 by the court reporter and during deliberations upon your
10 request the testimony will be read back to you in whole or
11 in part. So there is no need to take verbatim notes of a
12 witness' testimony.
13 Notes by definition are a brief written record of
14 something to assist your memory. A note should not take
15 precedence over your own independent recollection.
16 Remember, also, you are the finders of fact who
17 are responsible to evaluate the believability and accuracy
18 of a witness' testimony.
19 It is, thus, important that you be able to both
20 fully comprehend what a witness is saying and how a witness
21 is saying it.
22 Accordingly, you must not permit note taking to
23 distract you from the proceedings. If you make a note, it
24 should be brief and not distract you from what the next
25 question and answer are.

Opening Statement — Mr. Colangelo
Page 863
1 after headline that extolled the defendant's virtues,
2 headlines that Mr. Pecker specifically directed his
3 publication to make because of the conspiracy he reached at
4 the Trump Organization agreement.
5 Many of those headlines and the stories behind them
6 were even shown to Cohen and the defendant in advance before
7 they were published so the defendant could review them,
8 request changes, accept or reject publication stories, even
9 cover art.
10 The National Enquirer also ran stories attacking
11 Mr. Trump's political opponents.
12 You will see evidence of those stories at trial.
13 They include tabloid headlines and stories attacking one of
14 his political opponents, Dr. Ben Carson, accusing him of
15 medical malpractice.
16 They ran other stories attacking a then—candidate
17 named Senator Ted Cruz, accusing him of sexual infidelity,
18 accusing him of having some family connection to the JFK
19 assassination.
20 The National Enquirer ran these stories as a part
21 of that conspiracy that was launched at the Trump Tower
22 meeting, and they did it to help the defendant's campaign.
23 And after some of these stories came out, the
24 defendant even followed up with his contacts at AMI to thank
25 them for their stories and to praise them for their attacks
